BROWN: And we know there are three dead at least. Josh Campbell, thank you so much. And on the phone with me now is Lieutenant Rick Romero. He is with the lifeguard unit of San Diego's Fire and Rescue. Lieutenant, thank you for coming on the show. If you would, walk us briefly through what happened today when the call for help came in. What did your first responders see when they got there? LT. RICK ROMERO, SAN DIEGO FIRE AND RESCUE LIFEGUARD: Well, Pamela, I was one of the first responders on scene and it was a big mess along the coastline. There were people actively drowning, getting pulled off by rip currents. There were people on the base of the shoreline there. First report was there's bystanders doing CPR down below. So there's a lot going on when we first arrived on scene and trying to kind of take in what we need to do, to do the rescues. That was the first response. BROWN: Wow, I mean, just to show up and you're seeing people drowning. I mean, how do you even know what to do in that situation when there are so many different scenarios going on? People dying, people drowning, out calling for help. What was that like and how did you know how to go about rescuing them? ROMERO: Well, that's what we do. We train all the time for that obviously. But we have more than a lot of people, it's -- we need to get some more resources here especially on the medical side. So we had two lifeguard jet skis coming, two rescue boats on scene. We picked up seven people in the water who were actually drowning. Two of them were pronounced a little bit later on when they were transported back to the dock. And then just as the number started coming in, how many people were actually involved, the number kept on escalating so we're running out of ambulances, putting in a call for greater assistance to bring in more medical attention, so that's what we did. There was a lot of people there. Multiple agencies and the goal is to make rescues, provide people with great patient care and transfer as quickly as possible. And then, you know, take into account of what's going on, what are the dangers, what were the assessment, can you quickly assess someone and move on. All that kind of took place in a pretty quick amount of time. BROWN: So Customs and Border Protection officials are almost positive that this was a human smuggling operation that went horribly wrong. How often do you see that type of boat off of San Diego, and how concerned are you that this has the potential to happen again? ROMERO: Well, it's a pretty big",0.2027065527065527,2021-05-02
1268926,1580979,CNN,State Of The Union With Candy Crowley,"for you something that your Senate colleague, Marco Rubio, said on the floor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R) FLORIDA: They didn't have enough security. They maybe shouldn't have even been there at that stage in the process. Who's responsible for that? The buck stops with Hillary Clinton. (END VIDEO CLIP) CROWLEY: First of all, that was Marco Rubio On Fox News. but to his point, let me ask you, is Hillary Clinton partially to blame for this lack of security and therefore accountable for those deaths? KING: Well, I've thought a lot about that, Candy. That's a hard question. It's ultimately a political question. Yes, she was secretary of state. Was she the person making decisions about security at U.S. facilities? By the way, there are over 100 around the world that have security. Did somebody come to her and say we need more security at Benghazi and she said, no, don't bother? There's no evidence that I've seen that she was directly involved in that decision. On the other hand, she's the CEO. She's the boss. And I've gone back and look at the law and how you hold CEOs accountable for lapses down the line. And, generally, the standard is there has to be some either knowledge or participation in the decision. As I said at the beginning, I think the American people are going to have to make this decision. I'm not being a partisan of Hillary here, but I do think, you've got an organization with 20 or 30 or 40,000 people to say that an individual decision about one facility is the responsibility the boss who really wasn't making that decision. Now, having said that, there's no question the state department screwed up here. And there should be accountability, in my opinion, who made -- who did make that decision in light of all the information and why and I think that's a very fair question. And frankly, I'm surprised and disappointed. I know some people who have been sort of shifted around, but you know, if accountability means anything, it means somebody paying a price for having made a disastrous decision. CROWLEY: Right. So, then report people that kind of put on leave but then they were abound not to have done anything terribly wrong, and they were shift around to other jobs. So, you would agree that no one has been held accountable for the fact that the state department failed whether in the person, Hillary Clinton, or anyone else at the state department. They failed to protect U.S. property and the U.S. people in it despite all those warnings. You think someone should have been fired. KING: Yes. I agree. I haven't seen any real accountability and I think that's been a failure in this whole process. And actually, Susan Collins, my colleague from Maine, had a kind of addendum to the report where she identified some people that she thought should be held accountable based upon her work on",0.2324987510652678,2014-01-19

1809079,2125039,CNN,New Day,"issue for this man and that's why he is projecting it onto the race. That is not so dissimilar from what we expect from a lot of voters today. There's something very personal about this election. The idea of reproductive rights of the role of faith in society and our culture, those are big issues for people down there, and Roy Moore is banking on them, yes? DAVID GREGORY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, no question about it. And I think he's banking on a sense that voters in the state might feel that many around the country and in the news media and in the establishment in Washington are looking down their nose and saying Roy Moore is not fit to be in this institution of the Senate, that he has done things and believes things that disqualify him. And people may not look at the substance of those things. They may want to discredit the women that accused Roy Moore of misconduct or, you know, look aside as his wife uses textbook anti-Semitism to defend their views about Jews and say, no, we are just going to vote on the fact that this is a strong conservative who is against abortion rights and is a Christian whom we can really put our faith in. What is true about the stakes in the election is it has become a proxy fight in the country writ large. It's almost as if this is a president election. Every major political figure from both parties is involved in trying to get out the vote in this state in what is going to be a low turn-out election, one that is absolutely going to favor Roy Moore. But the Republican Party is torn apart over this race, and that's one of the reasons the stakes are very high in a close divided Senate. CAMEROTA: Hey, Chris, about 74 year old Nathan Mathis who was just on with us, if he can work his way around to feeling so different because of his own personal experience with his gay daughter, is there any chance that times are changing and that Roy Moore's positions on homosexually, on blacks, on women, on Jews, these are things that he has said that maybe times have changed in Alabama. CHRIS CILLIZZA, EDITOR AT LARGE, CNN POLITICS: I do think tonight will give us some indication of that, Alisyn, but David makes a really important point, which is this is a December 12th special election. It's two weeks before Christmas. This is not a standard issue vote. Most voters are not used to voting at this time. So what's difficult, I think, is that -- this is not -- I don't think we should necessarily, though people will, take of whatever happens that this is somehow indicative of what Alabama thinks. It's indicative of what the people paying attention to this election are willing to turn out at this time think. The higher the turnout, the better for Doug Jones,",0.1383205400260232,2017-12-12
2336892,2657564,CNN,Cuomo Prime Time,"the White House concerning speech parameters. Former federal prosecutor, Elliot Williams joins me now, to dig into the congressman's legal arguments. A little bit of context, Elliot. First, so this is a civil suit. This is a private lawsuit filed by Eric Swalwell, against Mo Brooks, and others, seeking accountability for the events of January 6. Is the lawsuit viable? ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: It is. But here's the thing, it's not just Mo Brooks. It's Mo Brooks, the individual, in his personal capacity, not Mo Brooks, the congressman. And the tricky question here, Michael, is where does, the man end, and the congressman begin? Now, Representative Swalwell's lawsuit claims that these are all statements that are made, in his personal capacity. What Representative Brooks has said, in his filing today is ""No, no, no, no, no. This happened during the workday. It happened on the grounds of Congress. I was driven there by a member of my staff. Therefore, this must have been an official act of me, as a congressman. And therefore, you can't sue me for it."" SMERCONISH: Elliott, you know that the discussion continues in the House of Representatives, about a congressional inquiry into January 6. In fact, I'll be talking about it in just a moment. But, as a plaintiff's lawyer, as a trial lawyer myself, I look at this, and wonder, might the discovery phase, from this litigation, bear fruit? WILLIAMS: Absolutely, there's no question that it will, because there's open questions as to number one, as you teased in the beginning, what kinds of communications were there, between Representative Brooks and the White House? Number two, what conversations were there between among members of Congress? Number three, what communications were there between the President and other members of Congress? And all of that's going to come out in litigation. It's just this tricky question, like I said, of whether you can actually sue these people. And there's a - there's an expansive definition, as we saw just, I guess, a month ago, with Donald Trump, and the defamation suit that was claimed to be in his personal capacity, even though it was given at a press conference. If you remember the E. Jean Carroll lawsuit, where he was alleged to have defamed someone, while in a White House press conference, it was claimed to be ""Well, this isn't personal conduct. He's the President of the United States."" And courts and, frankly, the Justice Department right now, regard the definition of ""In the scope of employment"" quite broadly. SMERCONISH: Start taking down names, and kicking ass, the words of the congressman on that day. WILLIAMS: Yes. SMERCONISH: And in his response to Eric Swalwell, I may be able to put a full screen up that shows this, but I can tell you, he said, ""Well, the context is important because the words of the sentence or the paragraph actually began ""As such.""

1102055,1401095,CNN,Nancy Grace,"the lakeshore. GRACE: So it`s a gorgeous area. Lake Lanier is a very high-profile resort area. And this picnic area where this little girl, a 16-year-old sophomore in high school, was last seen sitting. I`m confused tonight. I`m wondering why she was afraid to ride her own school bus. And what do we know about mystery tweets that were left behind? Back to Ninette Sosa, reporter 106.7, there at the scene. What can you tell me about the early evening when she was last seen? 7:30 in summer hours, that`s still broad daylight. SOSA: And especially in Georgia, Nancy, because here it stays light until after 9:00 PM throughout the month of August, early September. So it`s not as though it`s a night sky, by no means. But what`s curious about this are the tweets leading up to that date. And maybe credit to the mom for being so prompt within that window time of three hours. She was seen there at 7:30, according to authorities. By 10:15, the mom`s making a phone call about her missing daughter because it`s too late for her to be out. GRACE: You know, what`s interesting is that the neighbors saw her. It`s not like she was in some secluded area. Back to Ninette Sosa, joining me there on the scene. This is an exclusive resort area there on beautiful Lake Lanier, a lot of boating, a lot of celebrities go boating there, have homes there. Ninette, where she was sitting, it was the picnic area there in that wooded complex. Let`s pan back. This is just a gorgeous area, very rural, right there where -- by the entrance to the gated community. Ninette, explain to me where the picnic area was. SOSA: That picnic area is going to be right behind the apartment complex. That is -- and she was found a short distance from there, but the following evening, right about 7:00-ish. So sometime between 10:15, when Mom calls, My daughter is missing, and then to the following night, by 7:05, 7:15, her body is found in a wooded area. And a lot of times, you don`t associate -- or people think, Well, if you`re next to the lake, how can it be wooded? But you know, that`s Georgia. It`s just that way. You got the -- you got the presence of forestry, and then right there you also have beautiful Lake Lanier. So the setting is just -- it`s not a risque (ph) setting by no means. It sounds safe. GRACE: Everybody, we are taking your calls. I want to go out to John Phillips at 790 KABC. What more can you tell us about the night she goes missing, John? JOHN PHILLIPS, KABC: Well, those mystery tweets that you were referencing, Nancy, happened not a long time before this. It happened the day before, the last one, where she foreshadowed that there was something wrong. There was a tweet unrelated to the foreshadowing tweets that particular day.

They're talking about a vaccine that was developed using a chimp adeno-vector, as opposed to the mRNA. So, they really are not comparable, when you talk about the duration that you will wait before you get the second dose when you're talking about Pfizer or Moderna, which is what we're using here in the United States. BASH: That's a really important explanation, because there are a lot of people confused about it. Let's talk about schools. Dr. Fauci. The administration says that schools should open in person, as long as they are following the five steps from the CDC, like social distancing and wearing masks you talk so much about. Given the science, are schools being too cautious, do you think? And are there schools closed right now that should be open in person? FAUCI: You know, I mean, obviously, it's a very difficult situation to get an absolute definitive answer. What the CDC has tried to do is look at the risks that you have and try, if you follow the CDC guidelines, to get the children back in school, at least with hybrid, and maybe, even when you actually have increased spacing with them, that you can get it in what's called a decreased capacity. If you do the four or five things that the CDC recommends, the bottom- line goal that I think people need to remember is that -- and I have said this way before the CDC guidelines came out -- that the default position is to do whatever you can, as best as you can, to get the children back to school, with safety concerns for the children and for the teachers and the educational personnel. And that's what we're trying to do. That's what the president is talking about, about getting those K-12 schools open within the first 100 days. BASH: But the... FAUCI: And that is what we want to do. BASH: Yes. And so, for administrators, superintendents, teachers listening to you right now, what is your advice to them? Should they push the boundaries more than they are? Because there's a lot of frustration out there that the CDC guidelines are -- as you explained, they're pretty clear. But the schools are dragging their feet. FAUCI: Well, yes, I mean, obviously, the situation the ground, the teachers are going to make their decisions, and the schools are going to make their decisions. The CDC gives guidelines. If you follow the guidelines, I think it will go a long way to be able to get the children back to school in the safest way as you possibly can. One of the things that comes up is that we will be doing more and more of -- and I think these are things that are important to put into the mix of the consideration -- is that teachers",0.1769299219357419,2021-02-21

TIFFANY CROSS, CO-FOUNDER AND MANAGING EDITOR, ""THE BEAT D.C."": Well, I think he's won the battle but not the war. He's now set up a precedent for when there's a Democratic White House, that these people can do the same thing. Ana, we've gone from talking about one hoax to another. This whole idea of a national emergency is a hoax. And let's just point out, if we may, the hypocrisy of the mega-crowd who cheers this on. In order to do this, he's taking away funding from our armed services. Where are all these people who are all about supporting the troops? And to do this, he would have the take away land from private citizens to build this wall that he wants to build. I'm sorry, where are all these small government Republicans who scoffed at such a thing? I remember when that right-wing nut had a stand-off in Nevada with law enforcement over this very issue. And he had a whole amen (ph) corner cheering him on to protect his land. Yet, now that this wall is coming, it's no problem. You also have Customs Border Patrol turning away unaccompanied children seeking asylum. I'm sorry, where are all the pro-life people who love fetuses but don't love live children in the dessert trying to save their lives? This is hypocrisy and we have to call it out for what it is. And as long as we keep putting a blanket and a pretty bow over this type of ridiculousness, then it'll keep -- it will continue. I think we have to call the president out in the main problem are the followers because that's who this wall is for. CABRERA: Democrats and Republicans both believe that border security is an issue that needs to be addressed. It's part of why they passed the amount of money that they did in the spending bill.

And I don't have to do it for the election. I've already done a lot of wall for the election 2020. And the only reason we're up here talking about this is because of the election.

They don't want to see more stalemate, more name-calling and blame-shifting. They want to see the deficit addressed in a straightforward, honest way and they're not seeing, my view, not seeing the president do that. They know that the economy's not creating the kind of jobs that we need. I mean, we're at 9.2 percent unemployment. We've got millions of Americans, almost 20 million Americans either out of work, can't find a job that they want, or are so turned off that they're outside and not even looking for a job anymore. It is a profound problem facing America and they're not seeing, in my view, a president who's stepping up and saying, here's the way forward. He tried something with the stimulus package. He put some political capital behind that and I think people look at it and say, didn't look like it worked. FOREMAN: You've got to give Michele Bachmann credit for this.

375850,593003,CNN,Live From...,"KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, everyone, I'm Kyra Phillips. Zacarias Moussaoui take two. The admitted 9/11 conspirator is taking his fate into his own hands one last time, again taking questions on the witness stand in his death penalty trial in Virginia. Let's get straight to Jeanne Meserve in Alexandria -- Jeanne. JEANNE MESERVE, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Kyra, the testimony has been all about Moussaoui's dislike and distrust of his legal team. They have had a very fractious relationship. He has said repeatedly, ""They do not represent me."" He represented himself for awhile until the judge put an end to that. Today on the stand, he expanded on his displeasure with his attorneys, accusing them of criminal non-assistance, criminal non- assistance of defense counsel, he said. He criticized them for not asking for a change of venue, pointing out that this courthouse some' few miles many not Pentagon, which was hit on 9/11. He accused them of wanting fame, and said, ""You put your vested interests above my interest to save my life."" He also said that he had asked from the very beginning for a Muslim lawyer to represent him in court, but that had not happened, although one Muslim lawyer from Texas had volunteered his services free. He said, ""I wanted to have someone in court who I could trust."" Moussaoui then went on to criticize the strategy that his defense counsel has been employing. He says that in conversations with them, he has told them that their strategy to bring up his mental health, to portray him, in his words, as crazy, would not work. And he suggested to them an alternative approach they might take. Specifically, he told them that they should try to tell the jury that life in prison would be worse than death and that they should deny him martyrdom, which is something he might like. And, third he suggested that he might be useful at some future date as a bargaining chip. Perhaps, he said, if some Americans were taken captive in Iraq or Afghanistan, he could be traded and would end up saving an American life. Of course, this all indicates that Moussaoui wants to live rather than die, which would some to contradict why he testified in the first phase of his trial. You remember that he went on the stand previously and said that he had had a role in 9/11, that he and Richard Reid were supposed to have hijacked a fifth plane that was going to fly into the White House that day. He also said that he had not told investigators everything he knew about the 9/11 plot so the plot could go forward. Asked why he did that, why he testified that way, if he didn't want the death penalty, he said, ""Well, this might not be understandable to you who are not Muslims, but I was putting my trust in my god.""

And he said, all right, Mom, save me some polish sausage. And I stood at the door and watched him get on his bike and ride down the street. And that was the last I saw of my son. FREED: Like the families of Shawn Hornbeck and Ben Ownby, Arlin Henderson's mother has never stopped searching for her son, never stopped hoping that he will come home. HENDERSON-GRIFFITH: Someday there's going to be a miracle, and you're all invited to the party. FREED: Jonathan Freed, CNN, St. Louis, Missouri. (END VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: Police say one of the most troubling things about this story is that Devlin, for more than four years, was able to keep his dark secret from everyone who knew him. His co-workers and friends say they had no idea that a young boy was living with him. His neighbors assumed Shawn was his son. They say Devlin didn't try to conceal him. Even more amazing, he didn't even avoid the police. We'll have more on that now from CNN's David Mattingly. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROB BUSHELLE, MICHAEL DEVLIN'S NEIGHBOR: He pointed to this sign over here. DAVID MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Late last summer, Rob Bushelle says he got into a loud argument with a neighbor over a parking space. BUSHELLE: He wanted this space, and I was kind of in the middle of these two. MATTINGLY (voice-over): That neighbor was an irate Michael Devlin. (on camera): So he was getting angry at you just that quick? BUSHELLE: When he pulled up, he was angry. When he saw my car here, he was already angry. It was -- I mean, just like... MATTINGLY: Were you intimidated? BUSHELLE: A little bit. MATTINGLY: Did you think there was going to be a fight? BUSHELLE: Yes. I mean, my first instinct is that I'm about to get in a fight with this guy. MATTINGLY (voice-over): There wasn't a fight. At the time, Bushelle says Devlin was accompanied by the abducted Shawn Hornbeck. But in a move that no one today can understand, Bushelle says Devlin, himself, called the police. BUSHELLE: That was my first and last run-in with him. MATTINGLY: And other neighbors say they had problems as well. Harry Reichard lives above Devlin and complains Devlin disturbed him with frequent late night shouting and unexplained noises. HARRY REICHARD, MICHAEL DEVLIN'S NEIGHBOR: And the yelling and the vulgarity and everything, it's just ridiculous. MATTINGLY: You never got a chance to talk to him about this though, did you? REICHARD: No, I want to stay away from that guy. I don't like that man. He basically, you know -- you know, is somebody that I don't want to deal with.

(END VIDEOTAPE) LAVANDERA: Ali, one of the other debates, and I think most people around the country with when they hear of Texas education, really with the little they have heard, are these debates about how evolution and -- should be taught in science classes and intelligent design. Some people think it's a code word for creationism. Those are the kind of debates that some people here in Texas say have made the state a laughing stock. The Perry administration has always welcomed these debates and they say, look, everyone deserves a seat at the table. They say that all of the -- everyone's point of view should be debated. But obviously, the governor's critics say this isn't the kind of debate you want to take to a national level. VELSHI: You bring up the fact that while we tend to see that stuff on the news, those debates about the things you mentioned, in fact, Texas has a very large influential and contentious education system. LAVANDERA: Of course. VELSHI: And they've made some strides that other states haven't made, so this is a complex issue. Thanks for that, Ed. Good to talk to you. LAVANDERA: You got it. Thanks. COSTELLO: We asked you to talk back on one of the stories of the day. We asked you this question this morning: Is the criticism against Chaz Bono and ABC fair? Becca says, ""Our country is moving from the foundational godly values on which it was built. The many nations who do this have crashed and burned eventually. It will do us well to respect the god who created us and follow his commands. We will much better off that way."" This from Linda. ""How many LGBT people does God have to make before people figure out that he likes them""? (LAUGHTER) COSTELLO: ""In all of nature, not one organism is the same as any other. God obviously loves diversity. How is it an agenda to invite a person such as Chaz Bono to dance? No other contestant has been vetted for their character or questioned about their sexual orientation."" This from Gary. ""This is just more proof that anything is becoming acceptable. Shame."" And this from Mary. ""For heaven sake, how silly is all of this fuss. My Christian values say you accept everyone for who they are. By being so critical of people who are different, you could be missing out on a great friend. Good luck to Chaz. I hope he has a great time on the show. End of story.""

The truth is you're never going to change the fact that a president has the ability to fire people at will. That's embedded in executive power. But there's a larger point. You know, there were Democrats who complained about voting irregularities in 2004 in Ohio, and that they thought these were widely ignored. If we simply get into a system where there's no center in American politics, it's just a power grab. So, look what's happening with the way the Supreme Court is being treated. It's whoever has the power will make the rules. And if that just goes back and forth and back and forth, then that's where democracy really suffers. Because it's not just what Donald Trump is doing today, it's what he's ushering in is the only way to exercise power. BERMAN: David Gregory and Miles Taylor, thank you both very much helping us appreciate this moment. We talked about Chris Krebs, but there was another major assault on democracy overnight, and it took place in Michigan, where the Wayne County, that's Detroit, board of election certifiers refused to certify the election in Wayne County. Republicans stood in the way for a time of certifying this election, effectively trying to throw out the entire election in Michigan and we're told by the Trump campaign the goal was to turn it over to Republican legislatures so they could award Michigan's electors to Donald Trump even though he lost that state by 148,000 vote. Now, the Republicans on that county board relented overnight and ultimately did certify it, but I don't think it's over yet. Joining us now is the secretary of state of Michigan, Jocelyn Benson. Madam Secretary, thank you so much for being with us. What the hell happened overnight? JOCELYN BENSON (D), MICHIGAN SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, we saw the truth won out. Essentially, you saw two individuals on the Wayne County board of canvassers who have a ministerial responsibility to certify the election results, refusing to do so on baseless claims that were ultimately clerical errors that occur in nearly every election, in nearly every jurisdiction. And, notably, the public spoke out and identified and amplified the truth, which was that these elections should be certified, there's no reason they shouldn't be, and, ultimately, they changed course after public comment, changed their votes, and ultimately, the board voted 4-0 to certify the Wayne County election results, moving us now to a position where the state will then look and certify those results as well. BERMAN: I want to talk about the future in just a moment, but I want to talk about what you agreed to overnight. The secretary of state's office has agreed to look into, to audit, basically the election process in Wayne County. The specific gripe that they had was over discrepancies in the books and the actual vote. Explain that to me",0.327027027027027,2020-11-18

HARRINGTON: She had said she`d been taking them since she purchased them, and there were only 14 left. BROOKS: Oh, man! You know, it just -- the story just gets better and better. Let`s go out to the phones. Jill from Maine. Thanks for being with us. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you for answering my call. I was curious, I`ve heard that she`s being charged with neglect. How about child endangerment? BROOKS: That`s a great question. Go back out to Pat Harrington, the Tippecanoe County prosecutor. What charges is she being charged with exactly? I think there was two felonies and one -- and then also, she had been locked up and she pled guilty to a DUI just recently? HARRINGTON: Correct. She pled guilty four days before this incident to a misdemeanor OWI (ph) and was placed on probation and her license was suspended. Answering your caller`s question, Indiana, neglect of a dependent includes child endangerment, so that is our state law. BROOKS: Very nice. Very, very, very nice. I mean, this -- this is just unbelievable. Let`s unchain the lawyers, or I like to say, uncage the lawyers. We have Susan Moss from New York. She`s a family attorney and child advocate, which we need in this particular case. Alex Sanchez from New York, and from Philadelphia, Kevin Mincey, defense attorney. Sue Moss, one of the callers just asked about the welfare system. This is unbelievable to me. SUSAN MOSS, FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY: You know, it`s a real simple issue. Your designated driver can`t be in pre-school. Real simple. And for a mother to put her 5-year-old child in this situation absolutely is child abuse, to the extent that she needs to not only lose custody, but perhaps even lose parental rights to this child. Your child of 5 just can`t drive. BROOKS: No question. OK, Alex Sanchez? ALEX SANCHEZ,DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Look, you know the case is pathetic, I admit that. But it doesn`t mean that absolutely nothing can be done on behalf of this woman. You know, this case concerns damage limitation. What do I mean by that? That means that right now, she`s in jail. If she could possibly make bail, my advice to her would be, Don`t make bail. Stay in jail. Let`s send the message to the prosecutor, as well as the judge, that you intend on rehabilitating yourself. And the first thing you need to do is stay in jail, take advantage of some of the programs that are in jail, and let the system and let society know that you`re there to try to take care of your problem.

2295426,2615774,CNN,New Day Saturday,"in addition to a diplomatic problem. SANCHEZ: Yes, it's interesting that you - as you mentioned, that I'm thinking of a lot of conservative media that also sort of parrots, those talking points about Biden's age and his cognitive ability. I did want to ask you about this editorial effort by the Washington Post, what they wrote in this piece that's out today offering Biden this advice. ""This week's report,"" referring to a report from the DNI, ""doesn't anticipate that Russia will stop meddling anytime soon. The White House, the rest of the government and the rest of the nation can also protect themselves from whatever attacks do come by building trust, keeping on guard and refusing to play along."" What do you make of that advice the idea that Russia is not done meddling and that really all we can do is try to build trust with each other? DOUGHERTY: Well, I think they're pointing out something that's very serious. And with Russia, you have the solar winds hack, a massive hack into U.S. government offices, agencies, and also private industry. And then even from China, you have now, the implication by the United States that they are involved in yet another hack that has to do with I believe it's Microsoft Exchange. So you have some very serious cyber activity going on. And there is a great deal of concern about that. So I think, you know, if you put yourself in the position of the Biden Administration, they come in after the Trump administration in which President Trump was very friendly to Vladimir Putin but his government took actions against Russia, with sanctions, etc Biden comes in, and he has to be strong. But on the other hand, he knows that there are things that he is going to have to work with Russia on and discuss and negotiate with Russia on that's why when Biden came in, they did that arms control agreement almost immediately extending the New START agreement. So it's a very delicate balance. And, you know, I think one thing to point out, is this kind of posturing and public, you know, persona you're seeing with the Chinese now, in the meeting just the other day in Alaska with the Secretary of State, you're seeing it with Vladimir Putin. And it makes it very complicated, because this is a kind of a juicy, fun debate. I mean, you just look at what's happening in the media. But it's a very serious debate about how these relationships aren't going to work out. SANCHEZ: No question. I'm glad you mentioned those meetings between the Chinese and Secretary of State, Blinken.

And so they couldn't be bound by what the court and the McGhan case said. Well, the judge in the McGhan case said this applies to national security stuff too. So we do have a court decision and once more we have the court decision, the Harriet Miers case in the George W. Bush administration where likewise the court made short shrift of this claim of absolute, complete, and total immunity. Now there were also comments made about Ambassador Volker's testimony by Mr. Sekulow. And it was along these lines; Master (ph) Volker said the president never told him that the aid was being conditioned or the meeting was being conditioned on Ukraine doing the sham investigation. So well, I guess that's case closed unless the president told everyone, called them into their office and said hey, I'm going to tell you now and then I'm going to tell you now. If he didn't tell everyone, I guess it's case closed. Well, you know who the president did tell, among others, he told Mick Mulvaney. Mick Mulvaney went out on national television and said yes, they discussed it, this investigation, this Russian narrative that it wasn't Ukraine that invented in 2016, it was Russia. I'm sorry, it wasn't Russia it was Ukraine. Yes, that bogus 2016 theory; yes, they discussed it. Yes, that was part of the reason they withheld the money. And when a reporter said well, you're kind of describing a quid pro quo. His answer was yes, get used to it -- or get over it. We do it all the time. Now they haven't said they want to hear from Mick Mulvaney, I wonder why. The president did talk to Mick Mulvaney about it. Wouldn't you like to hear what Mick Mulvaney has to say. I mean if you really want to get to the bottom of this, if they're really changing the fact that the president conditioned $400 million of military aid to an ally at way, if Mick Mulvaney has already said publicly that he talked to the president about it and this is part of the reason why, don't you think you should hear from him. Don't you think impartial justice requires you to hear from him. Now, Counsel also referred to Ambassador Sondland and Sondland saying well, the president told me there was no quid pro quo. Now of course at the time the president said to Sondland, no quid pro quo, he became aware of the whistleblower complaint. Presumably by Mr. Cipollone. And so the president knew that this was going to come to light on the advice of apparently Mr. Cipollone or maybe others, the director of National Intelligence for the first time in history withheld a whistleblower complaint from Congress, its intended recipient.

The nation has its first locally transmitted case in more than 100 days. And Russia claiming it has the world's first coronavirus vaccine. Really? There's a lot of skepticism, to say the least. It is the biggest decision Joe Biden has faced so far in his bid for the White House, his choice for vice president. He promised it would be a woman, many demanded a black woman. A nod to African American voters whose unflinching support saved Biden's failing campaign during the party primary. And in the end, he went with the woman many saw as the most likely choice. The junior senator from California, Kamala Harris. Making her the first black woman, the first candidate of Indian descent, the first Asian to be running for the White House. CNN's Arlette Saenz begins our coverage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: The Democrat ticket is set with Joe Biden selecting California senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. Biden informed Harris of his decision over a zoom call from his Delaware home on Tuesday. Now the two faced off during the democratic primary as they were both running for president, including a heated debate moment over school bussing. But ultimately, Biden has said he doesn't hold grudges, and decided to go with the experienced campaigner as his partner on the democratic ticket. Now, Kamala Harris is one of only three women to ever be picked for the vice presidential slot on a major party ticket. But she's also making history of her own, as the first woman of color to be in that vice presidential nominee position. She is the daughter of immigrants. Her mother, from India, her father, from Jamaica. So this is quite the historic pick, selecting her. Particularly as Biden had faced some pressure to place a woman of color on the ticket with him. Now Biden and Harris will appear for the first time together as the democratic ticket, here in Wilmington, Delaware. They will deliver remarks before holding a grassroots virtual fund- raiser with their supporters to try to energize the base and all of their supporters heading into November's election.

First the breaking news on the Russia investigation. Sources telling CNN tonight that Robert Mueller's team is digging into a period when Donald Trump was trying to do deals in Russia while trying to decide whether or not he would run for President. One source says, among other topics Mueller is asking question about the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, questions including who paid whom. Much more on that in just a moment. Then there is news that on any other night would be our top story. Jared Kushner denied access to top secret intelligence. The president son-in-law and senior White House adviser who is operating on an interim clearance had the access downgraded last week after the chief of staff John Kelly made changes to the security clearance system. And we are learning from officials from at least four countries have reportedly discussed how they could use Kushner's business dealings and experience in financial troubles to manipulate him. That is according onto the ""Washington Post"" which also reports that those countries, Israel, Mexico, China and UAE acted on those conversations. The report goes on to say that a source said top White House officials were worried that Kushner was, quote, naive, and being tricked by foreign officials. I'm bringing in now CNN chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto. Jim good evening to you. What are you learning tonight? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So Don, my colleague, Gloria Borger, Pamela Brown and I are told that investigators for Mueller have recently been asking witnesses about Donald Trump's business activities in Russia prior to the 2016 Presidential campaign as he considered a run for President. This according to three people familiar with the matter, the lines of inquiry indicate in Mueller's team is reaching beyond the campaign to explore how the Russians might have sought to influence Trump at a time when he was discussing deals in Moscow and beginning that Presidential run. Mueller, of course, was appointed to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. But that also includes in his investigation links between Trump associates and Russians and any issues that might arise in the investigations. That said the President claims any investigation of the family personal finances would be in his view a breach of the specials counsels mandate. LEMON: What else can you tell us about the kinds of questions that Mueller is asking witnesses? SCIUTTO: It's reaching into a whole host of things that happened before the campaign really kicked off.

Other Republicans, they're saying something definitely different about Christine O'Donnell. Take GOP Chairman Michael Steele. He told our John King the naysayers need to stop it.

If you have people who -- maybe Karl Rove being realistic about whether or not she has a shot in a blue state. ACOSTA: Right. Exactly. CHETRY: But, at the same time, you have other considerations.

How big is this leak that we're looking at here? And in terms of the previous leaks that we've seen here with Edward Snowden and Chelsea Banning, where does this sit? BECKSTROM: You know, I built a financial software and took it public in over 15 years, at time we wrote 15 million lines of code, and that was with massive. Massive, in that software developed by, you know, one sort of rebelling company. Hundreds of millions of lines of code is, you know, an astonishing claim. And set of tools, if in fact that's verified true. Of course, the CIA will neither confirm nor deny, you know, that these were their tools. But, you know, we will learn, we'll hear from the marketplace of players, and practitioners, and hackers, and security experts. It will shake down. We'll have an idea of, you know, is this - did this in fact likely come from the CIA. SESAY: And, Rod, in these times, whenever these kinds of leaks happen, and whenever we hear of these kinds of actions of the likes of the CIA, the NSA, the question always comes up who's watching Big Brother? BECKSTROM: Well, you know, that's a good question. And for one, WikiLeaks is. And, you know, clearly, I have concerns about the fact that they're focused on transparency - seems to be so worried at United States, which is a great country overall, and tremendous supporter of free speech and of human rights, and with a strong record overall. And yet they've been much less focused on the countries that don't respect human rights, so much - which is a bit of an irony. If you think and you want to bring transparency to the global system, you really want to help improve the whole global system and not target - probably go for all the best countries. But the reality is, the other spies are watching, you know, United States activity. So, everyone's got intelligence operations going on in each other and counter intelligence operations. So, the new world we're moving into, is one of hyper transparency, and this is going to be the experience that all governments have. You know, I've been and I'm sad to see so much potential capability leaked from the United States government relative to others. But the reality is, all governments face this. And we also have to remember, different countries have different strategies here. The Chinese, if they found this information, they're not going to share it with WikiLeaks. They're going to exploit it and use it themselves. The Russians are likely, to use these tools as well for themselves. And there is also the greatest game in",0.1091562417866067,2017-03-08

Both companies' boards have approved the transaction, it's expected to be completed in the third quarter. The market reaction: Amerada Hess losing just over $2 a share, while Triton gained $14.5 on the day, gaining powerfully on that merger news.

You're accused, your company and others, of as much as $15 billion in overcharges. What's your reaction to that? WATSON: Well, first of all, Lou, I think for the last several months, we've been working very hard with California and trying to find a solution to the issue of shortage of supply, poor infrastructure development and hopefully a mitigation of demand. I think the latest noise about price-gouging and all these claims, big numbers thrown around, we didn't believe they had any justification for them -- and guess what happened. As you know, today at the settlement conference, the judge comes out and says, it's not only not 15, it's probably not even one. And that has not surprised us, that's in the industry news. Some of these numbers didn't have any basis of fact anyway. DOBBS: At this juncture, there is so much toxicity, so much poison in the air between the generators, the power companies, and the state of California. Will you ever get to business as usual? WATSON: You know, I think we already are. I mean, yes, there's lot of noise out there, but I want to say, I think the companies and the state are working very hard to try to fix this problem in a genuine interest. I think unfortunately, there's a lot of politicizing of the event and for whatever gain that might get anybody, but I really think that the industry in the state and the utilities out there are working real hard to make sure that we don't have any more problems in California.

Phil Mattingly is joining us from Ohio right now over at Kasich campaign headquarters. Phil, what are you learning? PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, Kasich advisers are telling me that they're growing increasingly confident about the state of this race, and part of the reason why is the numbers they're seeing from their primary target areas, the suburbs. Now, these are counties surrounding Ohio's biggest cities, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati. These are the backbone of Kasich's support in this state. They were during his two gubernatorial races. They have been the primary targets of his efforts over the last week. Wolf, what they're seeing right now is very positive from those areas. And if those areas are turning out in a big way, that's very good news for John Kasich. As of now, it looks like that is the case. And for his advisers right now, that's a positive sign as we head into the rest of this night, Wolf. BLITZER: Yes, Kasich really needs to win his home of Ohio. Phil, thanks very much.

I'm going to circle up here in the Cleveland area, down here around Columbus, and down here around Cincinnati. Why are they so important? Let's go back in time to the 2012 Republican presidential primary. Look at this. Mitt Romney just barely won Ohio, right, one point over Rick Santorum, but he won big here, Cuyahoga County, Cleveland, in the suburbs of Cleveland, Romney getting a 19-point win there, a huge margin in the Cleveland area, in the suburbs, Lake County just to the north as well, critical to Mitt Romney, ran up the numbers. Phil also mentioned down here. You come, Franklin County, the middle of the state. Columbus is the state capital. Tends to vote Democrat in November in a tough race, but a five-point lead here for Mitt Romney in the Columbus area and the suburbs around it, the suburbs very important in a Republican race. And then most importantly, Hamilton County down here in the southwest corner of the state, Cincinnati and the suburbs around Cincinnati. Again, look, a 20-point win for Mitt Romney there.

Yovy Suarez Jimenez, jogging at dusk near Fort Lauderdale probably took a break along a canal when an alligator, suspected to be this nine-foot alligator, attacked. Her arms were found in its stomach. More than 100 miles away, another young woman went snorkeling in a canal. Friends found her with her head caught in a gator's jaws. It was too late to save her. Also last weekend, a third woman was found floating in a canal behind some homes. Todd Hardwick, veteran hunter, never at a loss for words, finally is. HARDWICK: I'm speechless. I mean, I'm absolutely stunned. CANDIOTTI: Of 20 fatal attacks in nearly 60 years in Florida, Hardwick cannot recall three so close together. HARDWICK: People forget that an alligator is a cold-blooded predatory reptile. In that split second, he just, bam, gets it, pulls it into the water, game over. CANDIOTTI: Florida wildlife agents say this year's dry season is not that unusual, and mating season's the same. It's just that man continues to elbow in on the alligator's habitat. HARDWICK: Everybody wants their alligator caught first. Everybody's got the biggest, meanest alligator. CANDIOTTI: And because of the string of attacks, trappers' phones are ringing off the hook. HARDWICK: These are all state permits to go and remove alligators. They said that he was out of the water on the land and they would like him removed as soon as possible, that he's eaten three ducks already. CANDIOTTI: Over the years Hardwick has suffered only one serious injury. He took a giant hook in an arm when a line came loose and a gator's rolls made the cut even deeper. Most trapped gators are killed. Their hide, meat, skull all sold. If attacked, same advice that you get if it were a shark. Fight for your life. HARDWICK: Smack this gator, punch him, gouge his eyes out. They want an easy prey. CANDIOTTI: P.S.

CASTELLANOS: I buy the -- look, if you think you plant seeds and you don't grow anything, then you have a static analysis, yes, then farming does not work. OK? We can prove that. But that's not the case. Do you think that a larger private sector with more money in it is better and will grow more than a larger public sector with more money in that? (CROSSTALK) BURTON: Here's the problem, Anderson. We tried this with President George W. Bush, who said.... (CROSSTALK) BURTON: ... his tax cuts would focus on the middle class. (CROSSTALK) BURTON: But, actually, what happened was his tax cuts were not focused on the middle class, the wealthy got the extraordinary amount of the benefit from them, and what we saw was economic decline and then another tax cut that was focused on the wealthy and near financial collapse in this country. COOPER: Alex, in terms of the debate tomorrow night, there are those who say, look, this isn't Mitt Romney's strong point, the town hall style. We haven't really seen him in a town hall style. What are you expecting tomorrow? CASTELLANOS: Mitt Romney I think has been on the campaign trail now for five years, since before the last election, and he was doing ask Mitt anything town halls even then. I have seen him in this campaign, Anderson, get so much better. This process we have for these candidates is brutal. It really takes a lot out of them but it's brilliant because they meet so many Americans, they hear so many stories. You are hearing Mitt Romney talk on the trail now about how many people he's met that under Barack Obama have lost their jobs, lost their hope. COOPER: So you're optimistic? BURTON: I think we have seen Mitt Romney connect in a lot of ways. Barack Obama is actually very good at this town hall format, too. Maybe if both these guys are good, we can actually make a judgment on substance. COOPER: Bill, the pressure is on for the president. What are you expecting tomorrow night? Obviously, I assume you think he will be more aggressive than he was the first time around. BURTON: Well, there's no doubt that Mitt Romney did himself some good in that first debate, but just from a strictly polling standpoint, if you look at what happened, the president has remained pretty stable, but Romney has been able to consolidate some support that he was already going to get. Now, the town hall format I think could hold some challenges for Romney, even though he's very experienced at this and he has done a lot, just like Alex said.

Now, eight years later, this community is walking it backwards, symbolizing they've come full circle, and Jaycee has come home. EDWARDS: All of us are just like in awe. We keep getting goose bumps. FINNSTROM: In the years since Jaycee vanished, this community has held its children tighter. EDWARDS: I'm constantly trying to find out where she is and reach out for her hand. FINNSTROM: That fear even more real for Edwards. The week before Dugard disappeared, Edwards says she told her parent a car with a man and woman inside followed her home from the bus stop. EDWARDS: I remember hearing the tire tracks pull on to the dirt road behind me and freaked me out. And I remember walking faster, hearing the tires go faster and that made me even more scared. And so, then, I ran home. STEPHANIE TARPEY, AMELIA EDWARDS' MOTHER: We just thought it was a 10-year-old being overly dramatic and didn't really believe her actually. FINNSTROM: Edwards says at the time, she immediately recognized sketches of the car and the woman suspected of involvement in Jaycee Dugard's disappearance. EDWARDS: At 11 years old, it was -- it was my worst nightmare coming true. My mom stated, you know, it's the bogeyman coming to life. FINNSTROM: Edwards needed to do something.

Again, he went to law school and then also took a year off to be a missionary in Latin America; and he's really devoted his life to real fights around social justice, working with immigrants, on housing and other issues, civil rights.

It is that in their view, their position is that Congressman King's hearings only serve to incite fear among Americans against the Muslims as a whole, even though he says that he is only focusing on a few Muslims in the country who have been radicalized. And the other message is that there is a fear that Americans will be seen overseas as attacking Islam and not a small minority of Muslims who have been radicalized. I spoke with one of the organizers of today's rally and he is business mogul Russell Simmons. And he says that in his view, Congressman King's hearings will only serve to demonize Muslims in this country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSELL SIMMONS, ENTREPRENEUR: (INAUDIBLE) All over again and to criticize the whole or to demonize the whole community because of the actions of a few is very un-American.

Hi, how are you? ROBERTS: I've been looking forward to this all morning long. First of all, Silvia, happy Mother's Day to you. And I want you to look at the monitor and check out Karina. Tell me how you think your daughter looks. SILVIA PEREZ, MOTHER: She looks great. ROBERTS: Karina, what do you think? Mom looking pretty good, too, huh? K. PEREZ: Oh, yes, especially for this early in the morning, she looks great. ROBERTS: We're on L.A. time to get Silvia up today. Silvia, I want to start with you. Today being Mother's Day and all, and being separated from Karina has to be pretty tough for you. But how often are your thoughts of your daughter, besides today, throughout the day since she left in October? S. PEREZ: I think about her all the time. ROBERTS: And for you, obviously, safety is a concern for your daughter. She's right now currently in Baghdad, but she used to be stationed in Mosul. So how often are you keeping up with your daughter's changes and her daily routine in Iraq? S. PEREZ: She usually calls about once a week, and when she doesn't I really get worried. ROBERTS: Because you haven't heard from her in over a week's time. And that's normally the routine for the family. S. PEREZ: Right. ROBERTS: Here we see a family picture, you with your husband and your other two children. Karina there on the left-hand side. Karina, for you, how difficult is it to be away from home on holidays like today? You did leave in October, so you missed the major holidays at the end of last year, Thanksgiving and Christmas. So how do you try and get through days like today where you have to be away from your family? K. PEREZ: Usually, I mean, it's hard. Yes, we did leave right before the holidays started. So it was kind of rough, you know, spending Thanksgiving and Christmas out here, especially coming from such a big family. I mean, my dad is one of 13 kids, so holidays are just big and huge and we get together. And so on days like this, when I'm not able to be with my family, I just really try to think about the times that I do spend with my family and try to call them and make sure that they're having a good time.

And hello, again, everybody. I'm Rick Sanchez. Tonight, you're going to be seeing the very first pictures of presidential candidate Barack Obama's overseas with U.S. troops. Those are stills that you're looking at behind me that we've been getting from this trip by this junior senator, a trip that seems to be captivating the rest of the world as much, if not more the many in the United States. I want you to evaluate for yourself Obama's performance. But know this: the White House has, tonight, accidentally released an e-mail that seems to give Obama a boost overseas. They probably wished they hadn't hit that send button when it happened. First though, let's get to this video. We begin with Senator Obama as he makes an appearance at a gym in Kuwait. Here it is.

Senator Obama argued the U.S. should negotiate with Iran. Here, today, is Undersecretary of State William Burns in Geneva negotiating with the Iranians over their nuclear program. Senator Obama also argued for a timetable to remove troops from Iraq within 16 months. President Bush has announced that he plans to set up a, quote, ""time horizon.""

Caldwell eventually did request a DOD investigation into the hospital. It began after the 2010 election. A senior Pentagon official tells us there is no indication the White House knew about any of this, and the Pentagon says, again, that the conditions at the hospital are so much better that even TV cameras now can go in and have a look. Fred. WHITFIELD: All right, Barbara Starr, thanks so much for bringing that to us. Appreciate it. This week on Tuesday the House Armed Services Subcommittee begins hearings on this very hospital issue. Next hour, Barbara Starr will be back with another disturbing story out of Afghanistan.

This type of public punishment is a painful reminder of what life can be like in that country. Next hour, I'll talk to someone who says so- called honor killings are an Afghanistan cultural problem, not necessarily driven by the Taliban. Now to Syria. International peace envoy Kofi Annan is in the capital of Damascus for a meeting with President Assad. Broken buildings and deserted streets bear witness to the continued violence there.

A tragedy in Russia that no one saw coming. In the middle of the night, rain-swollen rivers overflowed, sending flood waters racing through the towns in the country's Krasnodar region. At least 150 people were killed. Hundreds of others have been injured, and more than 12,000 people are now homeless. Officials say the flood waters rushed through the towns with such force, roads were ripped up and cars were pushed into the sea.

THOMAS: Thanks, John. VAUSE: North Korea says it will continue to reject nuclear talk with the U.S. until it rolls back quote, hostile policies. Two senior U.S. officials are in Seoul meeting with their South Korean counterparts. On Wednesday, they once again called for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula saying Pyongyang's nuclear program must be addressed urgently. CNN's Paula Hancocks live for us again this hour in Seoul. It's interesting because on Tuesday while in Tokyo the U.S. secretary of state revealed that the North had rejected a number of offers to talks. So is Pyongyang playing hardball here or is this just the normal state of play with a new administration in the White House? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, to be honest, John, the new -- the normal state of play with a new U.S. Administration is to fire something, is to have a weapons test or a missiles test. We haven't had that so far and that's surprised some people although U.S. officials told CNN the U.S. intelligence assesses they could be planning a weapons test. Which would be the first for President Biden. But what we're hearing here is rhetoric from North Korea, we're hearing one of the top North Korean diplomats saying that they will not talk to the United States until they change their hostile policy. And there's no point in the U.S. continuing to try and talk to them until they have made that change. This is something they have said many times in the past. So although they are rejecting the United States, it is a new U.S. administration and they're certainly being a lot softer on them, shall I say, for want of a better word, than they have been with previous administrations. With President Obama, with President Trump, they both saw weapons tests very early on in their new administration. So we'll have to see what happens there. But Secretary of State Blinken had a press conference today with his secretary of defense and both of their counterparts, and he did point out once again how important it was to work together to try and prevent and stop this nuclear missile program.

I know it's the moment for myself and a lot of the people that have come out to support in the immediate aftermath here in Minnesota. There's definitely a different energy. There's definitely a different level of support and commitment. I think where we go from here is, we have to take a strong look at rebuilding this thing from the ground up. You know, the communities in this country have to take back their sovereignty, and it's going to be ugly. It's going to be ugly. And our president, Donald Trump, being the liar that he is, ran on the idea of sovereignty.

We do believe we deserve sovereignty, and we will stand up for it.

GARCIA: I mean, this has always been an organization that I thought needs more professionalization, more of a career track at this particular organization. It is sort of controlled by what the state constitution says, so we have to have a balance of Republican and Democrats at every polling site. So we want to make sure that they are able to count the votes. That is so important in a democracy. HILL: As mayor, you could not change this, just to be clear for folks at home. New York City operates a little bit differently than the most -- than most other places when it comes to the board of election, but there would have to be -- if changes were made, it would have to be in concert with the governor. GARCIA: Yes. HILL: It's not just the mayor. But do you believe that changes do need to be made to the New York City Board of Elections? GARCIA: There's actually legislation currently in Albany to streamline some of the functions of the board of elections, particularly on absentee voting. HILL: And is that legislation adequate? GARCIA: That will be the first step. And then I think we need to see what we need to do to make it so that they're able to give us better results. HILL: Are you concerned at all about the integrity of the vote? There has been so much discussion over the past year, frankly, and so lies have been pushed about voting in this country. What does this do? GARCIA: So, I am concerned that it undermines people's confidence. There is no one on my team or where we've been doing observations of opening of ballots that gives us concern that there's something fraudulent happening at all. But we need to make sure that the vote is protected and that we get the result that New Yorkers went to the polls or mailed in at the end of the day. HILL: Are you concerned this could open up to conspiracy theories in any way? GARCIA: I am really hopeful that it won't. It seems like this was a straightforward mistake. But we will definitely be watching and monitoring as we go forward. We want it to be something that all New Yorkers have confidence in. HILL: In terms of -- I know you've said that, you know, rank choice voting, this is -- this is, you know, what the people said they wanted. Do you still feel that way? GARCIA: Oh, absolutely. We had rank choice voting passed by 73 percent in this city. From the voters that I've spoken to, they liked having the choices.

I even tried to report it. Now, the reason that I'm on here today is because I was speaking the other day, a couple days ago, to a group of teachers for a discovery museum and talking about an issue of customer support, how hard it is sometimes to get to the people that can really deal with your problems. And it's frustrating. And I sort of brought up this issue of how I had tried for a couple of months in different ways to get Toyota to hear about my problem. But mine is kind of minor. It's more like a radio button that doesn't work all the time. The car will start to accelerate in cruise control. You can hit the brake to stop it. And maybe it's scary for the first time for a couple of seconds, but once you know about it, it's not like I think it's life- threatening. I have been driving the car all these months. But it's a two-month-old story when it comes to me. (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: Tell us the problem. Tell us the problem. You have been trying to get in touch with Toyota to complain about this. But you've come up, what, against a dead-end? WOZNIAK: Well, the NHTSA has been a real problem for me to report things online or by phone. BLITZER: The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. WOZNIAK: And they really just want to take some data. They don't want to fix problems. They don't want to fix problems. They just want to hear about it for their database. But they did finally did get me a number of Toyota. And I got through. And I got up to the point of Toyota. It was difficult, because I have such a busy schedule, I haven't been able to do it all the time. I got through to Toyota. And they make a mark of it a few days ago. But a couple months ago, my wife took the car in for me while I was traveling. And they didn't quite buy her, that she had something, that there was something there, because there is a very explainable -- there's a different explanation that is more along the lines of user error in cruise control with the radar system. And they are right. And, also, I claim that I have a different story slightly. But, regardless, it's not the one that threatens lives, like cars that just suddenly start accelerating and you can't stop it and have no control. Once I heard that story, I sure did memorize the technique to quickly shift my car into neutral. BLITZER: And turn off the engine and get to the side of the road as quickly as possible.

It's kind of like trying to judge two sports teams against each other. One might be better in one area. Maybe, if we're going to use that metaphor, one might be better at doing screening processes because they do that more for employees and passengers where another airport is better under threat, because they just do better background checks for the people who work there. So it's very hard to look at a one-to-one ratio. Basically, it's going to meet the international standard and it's under the scrutiny right now because of all the issues that have happened in both Egypt and Paris. VAUSE: And Jeff, the Vice Chairman of EgyptAir he told us -- he made a point, actually, of telling us that there were no problems leaving Paris. He also made a point of saying that there was no special cargo onboard. He specifically spelled that out to us. What's the relevance of that? PRICE: I think probably the relevance there could be that aircraft carry hazardous material all the time and it's not all hazardous material. There are certain classifications that are authorized to be carried on passenger aircraft. There's other hazardous material where you can't transport it if there's a different type of hazardous material that if they somehow mix or get together it doesn't turn out well. So they'll have a dangerous good manifest onboard that says specifically what's in the cargo hold. So I think he's probably calling that out. It sounded like a very straightforward report on what an emergency crew would receive if an aircraft was coming in to land and was having a problem. So when I was listening in on that earlier, I think he was calling it out, maybe not necessarily to say that, hey, this is something I want people to focus on or look at. It was more just as part of the normal report. If an aircraft's coming into an airport, has an emergency onboard, they'll get the number of souls onboard, the amount of fuel onboard, they'll, hopefully, if they have anytime, they'll hopefully get any dangerous goods onboard so that aircraft rescue or firefighting personnel can be aware of that. That was basically the information on all of that. So not sure if he's really calling that out to call attention to it or just to say this was nothing onboard that would cause us concern at this point in time.

BLITZER: Do you think he'll run as a third party candidate? GALEN: He will. I think he will. Yeah. BLITZER: Do you think he will? BEGALA: I think if the Republicans nominate an extreme conservative, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, the people who run their party. He might see some opening. I'm not kidding. But Ms. Palin is the queen and king maker of the Republican Party now. It's inconceivable. You can't say things like that. It's not true. Lots of smart people are conservative. I'm standing next to one. Okay? And by the way, lots of perfectly moral people are liberal. The notion that all liberals are smart is wrong, all conservatives are pure is wrong. GALEN: It does remind me of what then candidate Obama said in California when he said about Pennsylvanians, that they're bitter and they rely on their guns and their religion. I think Bloomberg was in on -- BLITZER: I want both of you to stand by. I want to talk about the tea party and what Republicans are fearing incumbent Republicans as they're looking ahead to 2012, their own reelections. They're not worried about Democrats, but they're worried about other Republicans. Stand by for that. Also, Jack Cafferty coming up later. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Let's get back to the strategy session. Paul Begala and Rich Galen are here. Rich, a tea party spokesman said this. He's referring to Republicans who would be up for election in 2012, reelection many of then in the Senate. ""Hopefully the 2010 election results will cause more senators to see the light about excessive growth of government and deficit spending. So we will give them a chance to improve before we make them feel the heat in their reelection campaigns. After the results this week, my guess is many senators will suddenly be more willing to adhere to conservative ideals."" Mostly Republicans.

That's been the worry all along, there will be people that Obama can't get because they just don't quite believe in him. And people McCain can't get because, for example, they're conservative voters who just don't really believe he's conservative enough and they might stay home. Ultimately, that young woman said she might go with a write-in vote. But, as you look out the front of our bus here right now, you can see the Election Express burning toward Denver and the beautiful mountains around here near Cleveland. And traffic moving along smartly. You know that this tie is lined with many, many of millions of people between here and Denver, who all have their individual question about this election, Tony. And I'm telling you (AUDIO GAP) those undecided voters. People like that young woman who are still wrestling with this. As long as this election has gone one, but haven't yet made up their minds because they haven't been sold yet. HARRIS: If you get an opportunity for lunch there, grab yourself some pierogis there in Cleveland. It's one of the great places in the country to grab yourself some pierogis. Tom Foreman -- FOREMAN: Oh! Can't go wrong with those. HARRIS: There you go. On the CNN Election Express. Good to see you Tom, thanks. FOREMAN: I'll throw some in the mail to you, Tony. HARRIS: There you go! COLLINS: Eew. HARRIS: Thanks, Tom. COLLINS: They wouldn't taste so good after being mailed, I don't think. So, can tiny bacteria make a difference in U.S. dependency on foreign oil? Well, we're going to check out a fuel alternative after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HARRIS: Off shore oil drilling. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, apparently warming now to the idea. On CNN's ""LARRY KING LIVE"" last night, Pelosi said, she could be open to a vote on off shore drilling if, pretty big if here -- it's part of a bigger energy package. Pelosi says she wants to include a major investment in renewable resources at a release of oil from the government's strategic reserves. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), HOUSE SPEAKER: If you make a decision only to go with the off shore drilling, you're increasing our dependence on fossil fuels and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment, cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming. And the consumer is our first response -- the American taxpayer owns this oil off shore, by the way. And I want to make this final point -- this oil is owned by the American taxpayers. The oil companies drill, we give them money to drill there. But, we get very little in return.

And they are still talking. Keep going. All right, we have much more straight ahead in the Newsroom which all begins right now. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is CNN breaking news. WHITFIELD: All right, welcome back. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. Thanks you so much for joining me. We're following this breaking news this hour involving Japanese hostages held by ISIS. One of two Japanese captives reportedly has been killed. In a new video posted by a known ISIS supporter hostage Kenji Goto is holding a photograph that appears to show fellow hostage Haruna Yukawa beheaded. CNN is unable to authenticate that video, but these are images of Yukawa seen on the right you're about to see and his fellow hostage released by ISIS more than a week ago. These images released by ISIS more than a week ago. Now new demands. Instead of a $200 million ransom, ISIS is apparently demands release of a female suicide bomber that you see right here. She confessed to her participation in the 2005 deadly terrorist attacks in Amman, Jordan, killing 38 people. Our Jomana Karadsheh has the latest now live from Amman, Jordan. So is the discussion taking place now between Jordan and Japan about this latest demand? Would the Jordanians give this woman up? JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Highly unlikely at this point, Fredricka. We have reached out to the Jordanian government. They are not commenting at this point about the demand. They're saying that they are working closely with the Japanese government to try and verify the authenticity of the video. After that is done, they say they will be making statements about that. It is very difficult to see the Jordanians really caving into this command. Their position officially had always been that they will not negotiate with terrorists and they will not be going into a deal like this. But what we have seen over the past week since the release of that initial is video of the Japanese hostages is that Jordan has been working with the Japanese government. A crisis center of sorts has been set up at the Japanese embassy here in Amman. It is headed by the deputy foreign minister of Japan. Now, both Jordanian and Japanese officials in the Jordanian capital have been really tightlipped. They have not been disclosing any information about what's going on behind the scene. But one would assume that the reason Jordan is playing a critical part, perhaps, the Japanese government's utilizing whatever backchannels the Jordanians may have in talks to try and secure the release of these hostages. Jordan has its own captive held by ISIS, a Jordanian pilot whose F16 crashed in Raqqa in ISIS territory in December, Fred. WHITFIELD: And then Jomana, what is the status of this female prisoner? She was sentenced to death. KARADSHEH: Yes. Sajida Rishawi, she's an Iraqi national. She was part of that",0.0857715880213264,2015-01-24

(END VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS: Wood chips and summer heat, a combustible combination. The story in the NEWSROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HARRIS: Crews working around the clock to reach those trapped miners in Utah. They hope to have that third hole drilled by the end of the day. Live now to John Zarrella. Hey, John, if you checked out on the story over the last couple of days, has it moved significantly? ZARRELLA: Well, it's moved significantly from the standpoint that drilling has gone very, very well for that third hole. Yesterday, in mid-afternoon, they were already at 585 feet. So they should be by now very close to reaching that 1,400-foot level so that they can penetrate into that cavity at the far end of the mine where they hope and pray that these miners may be held up, waiting for the rescue teams to get there. Of course, speaking of the rescue teams, the mine company released video yesterday, fascinating video yesterday taken underground of that effort to reach the miners and the hustling miners, the teams that are down there. A hundred and thirty-four miners working around the clock to free these six trapped miners, and the work shows the extensive efforts that have been taken to shore up the inside of the mine, everything from chain-link fences, to water jacks, to steel cables. Everything to reinforce the roof of the mine and the sides of the mines. And, of course, all of that has slowed the progress of those rescue workers because of the precautions to protect the rescue workers themselves. But Bob Murray, the owner of the mining company, says now that the pace is really picking up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOB MURRAY, CEO, MURRAY ENERGY CORP.: We're in a third of the way, 700 feet out of 2,000. We have been -- since we got mobilized and got it going, maybe seven days. We are going about twice as fast as we were. So if we're in a third of the way in seven days, but going twice as fast, then another five to seven days we ought to be there. Now, that's just a mathematical calculation but we may encounter conditions underground, sir, that would make that longer. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZARRELLA: Now, of course, once this third hole is drilled, they will drop a camera down inside there in hopes they can see these miners. If they don't, there are plans for a fourth hole which would be somewhere right in between the first and second hole and the third hole, in the middle of this cavity, and they say if they drill that hole,",0.0412696530224993,2007-08-15

We are in Washington this morning for the first cabinet-level confirmation hearing of this brand new Congress, and what a place to start. HARLOW: Yes. SCIUTTO: Keep in mind this essential fact, President Trump fired his previous attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for failing to rein in the Mueller probe. And is now likely replacing him with someone who called a central part of that investigation, quote, fatally misconceived. The nominee is William Barr, up for what would be his second stint as Attorney General. He spent two years as A.G. under the first President Bush. But this time, if confirmed, he will take the helm of a Justice Department that is investigating the man who nominated him. Barr will oversee the Special Counsel whose probe into potential obstruction of justice. He has attacked, as recently as last summer. HARLOW: Yes. Just about six months ago. In his opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee this morning, you'll hear that at the bottom of this hour. Barr will pledge, and I quote, Bob Mueller will be allowed to complete his work. Second, I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the Special Counsel's work. Now, you can bet he will be hammered on his word choice there. What does he mean? Is the public actually going to see the entire report, or just be told what's in it? And you can expect Democrats to press really hard on that. We are surrounded by A-list colleagues. What else this morning as we count down to the opening gavel? Let's begin with Laura Jarrett on his background. So look, this is an Attorney General who has a lot of experience, obviously under Bush 41 who has a - a particular world view, and a particularly important legal view as it pertains to this president. LAURA JARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. I think the big takeaway is that Bill Barr doesn't just see himself as serving at the pleasure of the President. He seems himself as the President's lawyer. And he has such an expansive view of executive power that the way it intersects with the Russian investigation, given that President's campaign is under investigation still, given that the President is under investigation for obstruction of justice is the real thing I think Democrats are going to hone in on today. And yesterday he released a portion of what he plans to say and try to get out ahead of all of this. And I wanted to zero in just on one part where he talks about how important it is for the public to be informed of the results of the investigation. It doesn't say he's going to make the whole report open to the public. But he also says I can assure you where are judgments",0.0149475890985324,2019-01-15

He has got the ammunition and he wants to become known for being the most prolific killer in American history. SIDNER (voice-over): The sheriff hailed the suspect's ex-girlfriend a hero because she alerted authorities to text messages they say she received from Wix, saying things like, ""I want to open fire in a large crowd of people."" And in Connecticut, another man, another arrest, involving the fear of a mass shooting, 22-year-old Brandon Wagshol was picked up after a tip that he was trying to buy a large-capacity rifle magazine out of state. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was some Facebook post that indicated his interest in mass murder. SIDNER (voice-over): Police say he had the weapons at his home to carry it out. (END VIDEOTAPE) SIDNER: Now, Wagshol's attorney says that he thought his client was doing everything legal. His client thought he was doing everything right and that he was not trying to hide anything from police. CNN also tried to get in touch with the other two and/or their representatives and have heard nothing back. But there is something else that is common in all three of these cases. In all three cases, they were stopped, police say, because someone from the public or their social circles reported it. Don? LEMON: Oh, my gosh. What the hell? I want you to stay with me, Sara, because I want to bring Juliette Kayyem into this conversation as well. Good evening to both of you. Sara, you know, just two weeks after the massacres in El Paso and Dayton, it certainly sounds like we came awfully close to seeing more tragedy. Can you imagine? We could be sitting here, Sara, reporting on three mass shootings right now. Luckily, we are reporting that they were thwarted. SIDNER: That's right. The sad thing is, Don -- and I am sure Juliette will also concede to this -- that this is not a surprise because we've had more mass shootings than days of the year this year. So, it is the exception that we're seeing three different places, three different states with three different -- more than three different law enforcement agencies making these arrests. We're usually reporting on the aftermath of this horrible tragedy. This time, we're reporting on law enforcement that has gone fort and said, look, this appears to be a threat and we are going to try and nullify the threat, stop it from happening. Usually, reporting on the opposite thing. So I think we have to think in terms of this happens far too often. In fact, more mass shootings than days of the year. What does that tell us about what we are dealing with here?

85084,90926,CNN,Saturday,"DONNA KELLEY, CNN ANCHOR: There reportedly are no survivors from this morning's crash of a Florida National Guard transport plane south of Macon, Georgia. CNN got that information from the Dooly County sheriff a short time ago. The C-23 turboprop was flying from Florida to Virginia when it went down during bad weather near the Georgia town of Unadilla. It happened around 10:00 in the morning local time, carrying three crew members from the Florida Army National Guard and 18 other military personnel. Public fire and rescue workers rushed to the scene to put out the fire. The National Guard and Federal Aviation Administration are now investigating. And joining us on the phone, once again, as he did earlier with us is John Birdsong. He's the public affairs officer with air logistics at Robins Air Force base in Georgia. Mr. Birdsong, we have since learned from the sheriff in Dooly County that there were no survivors. Can you confirm that for us? JOHN BIRDSONG, PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER, ROBINS AIR FORCE BASE: Yes, that's correct. KELLEY: Of the 21 people, no survivors. BIRDSONG: Right. Three army crew members and 18 Air Force Air National Guard along with members of the 171st AB, Army Air National Guard, on board. KELLEY: And what stage are we at now then in the recovery of the bodies? BIRDSONG: It's ongoing right now. We have a support group down there who are helping local officials have been taking care of the crash scene up until now. We did confirm that it was an Army C-23 aircraft. KELLEY: It's a special ops plane. What are they supposed to be doing? What's their job? BIRDSONG: I'm not familiar with an Army C-23 aircraft as being a special ops-type aircraft. It could be, but I can't confirm that. KELLEY: We heard that it was a fixed wing turboprop used by special operations. That apparently came from a Florida National Guard spokesman. Do you know whether it was on a training mission now? BIRDSONG: I would -- my estimation would be they were probably just transporting them as passengers from one place to another. KELLEY: It came from Florida, was going to Virginia. Would that be a normal operation to transport people? BIRDSONG: I believe so. Yes, they were coming from Hurlburt Field, Florida on their way to Oceania, Virginia. KELLEY: We did talk to our Jacqui Jeras, our meteorologist earlier and you had mentioned earlier as well that it was raining pretty badly. And the sheriff told us that there was a fire but that the fire was out. Do you have any more information on what's happened with the plane. He said it was all in one spot but that it was broken apart? BIRDSONG: Right, we understand that our people who were on the scene did suppress the fire almost immediately.

We are here live on the campus of this beautiful university. We're going to have complete coverage tonight. Just want to point out to our viewers, Sunday on CNN's ""LATE EDITION,"" we're going to have a special interview with Democratic Vice Presidential Nominee John Edwards. He'll join me Sunday, noon Eastern, on CNN's ""LATE EDITION."" Let's get back to the news of the day -- that would be the second presidential debate tonight here at Washington University in St. Louis. The candidates are already here, so are literally more than 1,500 journalists, some of the staunchest supporters of both campaigns, including two who are joining us here on our CNN set. David Wade is the national press secretary for the Kerry/Edwards campaign. Tucker Eskew is a senior adviser to the Bush/Cheney campaign. Thanks to both of you for joining us. DAVID WADE, NATL. PRESS SECY., KERRY/EDWARDS: Thanks for having us. BLITZER: Ninety-six thousand new jobs created last month; 128,000 were created in August. Unemployment rate remains at 5.4 percent. You see this new ad that the Bush campaign has already run: nearly two million new jobs created in the last couple of years. WADE: Well, precisely the problem with President Bush is that he thinks this is reason to celebrate. Fewer jobs created than they expected. He's lost 1.6 million private sector jobs on his watch. He will be the first president in 72 years to lose jobs in his administration, sharing that title with Herbert Hoover. That is not reason to celebrate; that's reason for a new economic plan. BLITZER: If you take a look at all four years, a net loss of about 800,000, maybe 900,000 jobs. And so, David is right, the first time since Herbert Hoover, 70-plus years, that there will have been a net loss in jobs. TUCKER ESKEW, SR. ADVISER, BUSH/CHENEY '04: First time a president, Wolf, went through being handed a recession, being attacked on 9/11, having to take his nation to war twice, and facing up to corporate scandals that occurred in the last administration. The president's faced those things. We get accused of being in denial. He has faced some tough times. He's had plans for each of them. And on the economy, with tax cuts, lower regulation, and trying to fight litigation that the trial lawyers have made into a litigation lottery, this president has created jobs. We are on the roll.

14395,15740,CNN,Worldview,"ANDRIA HALL, CNN ANCHOR: Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians are preparing for Pope John II's historic trip to the Holy Land next week. In Bethlehem, where the pope will celebrate mass in Manger Square, thousands of police are preparing for one of the largest security operations the biblical city has ever seen. More now from CNN's Jerusalem bureau chief Walter Rodgers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. WALTER RODGERS, CNN JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF (voice-over): The Roman Catholic faithful, a priest and pilgrims offering prayers before Pope John Paul II's visit to Jerusalem. Like these Christian pilgrims, the pontiff is about to embark on a deeply personal pilgrimage. Unlike their's, the pope's is politically complicated, complicated because his church believes it has special responsibilities in Jerusalem. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is not possible to forget that the church has been founded in Jerusalem, by the Lord himself, because it is the city where Jesus suffered, died and rose again. RODGERS: Three religions lay claim to Jerusalem. It has been the center of Judaism for three millennia. Though historians say before the modern Jewish state, Jewish rule existed only about 400 years. Muslim's ruled here longer, but lost control after the first World War. For them, it is home to the Allaksa (ph) Mosque, the third-holiest shrine in Islam. Israelis and Palestinians both lay claim to Jerusalem and into this spiritual and political pressure cooker the pope is coming to pray. Some Arabs say the pope favors their claim to the city. HANAN ASHRAWI: I think the Israelis are trying to get the pope's blessings for their control over Jerusalem, which is very clear they wouldn't get it. Nobody in the world, be they pope, or be they secular leaders, would recognize Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem. RODGERS: Some Israeli's are wary of The Vatican's relationship with Palestinians. A recent agreement saw the holy sea warning that any attempt by the Jewish state to control the disputed city is -- quote -- ""morally and legally unacceptable."" Israelis were angry with The Vatican. MAYOR EHUD OLMERT, JERUSALEM: I don't need them to tell me which is my capital city. Jerusalem is my capital city. Jerusalem has been for 3,000 years the capital city of the Jewish people, undivided and united, and it will remain forever our capital, whether they agree to it or they don't agree to it. RODGERS: So the pope must carefully navigate this controversy, but Rome's position does not make it easy. A Vatican document two years ago stated -- quote -- ""Israel does not possess any legal title to the city, not even continued occupation and growing settling of the country would help Israel get title."" Yet on the eve papal visit, that hardline is being soft-pedaled. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The problem of sovereignty, this is an aspect that belongs to the politician and the politician has to solve.

1437897,1752480,CNN,Hala Gorani Tonight,"thoughts on this important day as - as we continue to follow these discussions between Greece and its creditors, with another important deadline approaching. A quick break. When we come back, we have more on a new ISIS onslaught - fear the militants' control of a critical dam could give them a new avenue to attack (INAUDIBLE) towns near Ramadi. Plus, former FIFA executive, Chuck Blazer, details decades of alleged bribes and kickbacks. We have an in-depth look at the key player in the FIFA investigation. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GORANI: Former FIFA Vice President, Jack Warner, is threatening to release a series of documents about FIFA and Sepp Blatter, he says. Warner is under indictment and, so far, has not produced any of that material. But it follows the release of transcript from another former FIFA executive, Chuck Blazer. The transcripts reveal Blazer admitting to accepting bribes and kickbacks over several decades. Also among the stories we are following this hour - officials in South Korea have confirmed five new cases of MERS, respiratory disease with no cure. They fear more than a thousand other people may have been exposed after a doctor infected with MERS attended a large symposium in Seoul. Three people in South Korea have died. The deposed Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, will go on trial for the third and final time over charges linked to the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising. The country's highest criminal court will hear the case in November. It accepted the prosecutor's appeal of a ruling that cleared Mubarak of those charges last year. Families near the Ramadi Dam in Iraq are beginning to flee their homes fearing an ISIS attack - yet another case of Iraqis running away from their homes in their own country. ISIS has closed off much of the dam limiting the water supply to pro-government towns downstream. This viewer (ph) amateur video appears to support witness accounts that the Euphrates River is now low enough to walk across. The fear is that ISIS may do just that and then attack nearby towns. Let's get the latest from Nick Paton Walsh. He's live in Baghdad. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GORANI: So, let's first talk about the implications of ISIS being able to control a dam in this way, Nick. NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESONDENT: Well you mentioned, Hala, the immediate threat, of course, is there was it seems until the past few days a kind of defensive line of moat (ph) between pro- government-held areas where there are Shia fighting groups and Iraqi security forces faced off the other side of the river - or was a river - with ISIS. If that river is now lower, ISIS could much more easily attack. (INAUDIBLE) much more troubling long-term implication of this river flow being significantly interrupted. We've seen images of video that show the river bed significantly close to the surface. But on the other side of the dam too, there's a lot of water now in",0.0149475890985324,2015-06-04
2289680,2609979,CNN,The Situation Room,"in connection with the deadly riot. Brian Todd is covering all the new angles for us. What's the latest, Brian? BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right, Wolf. Tonight, new information on serious charges being brought in this investigation, including, as you mentioned, charges against a former top State Department aide who had a top-secret-level security clearance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TODD (voice-over): Tonight, the first known Trump administration political appointee has been arrested for taking part in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Federico Klein, a State Department aide at the time of the riot, with a top-secret-level security clearance, who had also worked with the Trump campaign, has been criminally charged with pushing police officers and entering the Capitol on January 6, documents show. Prosecutors presented images allegedly showing Klein using a police riot shield to wedge open an entrance for rioters. Today, prosecutors asked the judge to keep Klein behind bars pending his trial, while he complained about cockroaches crawling over him in his jail cell. And Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, who donned face paint and a headdress and carried a spear inside the Capitol, appeared before a federal judge today. It comes as Chansley pleads his case in the media. Charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct, among other counts, Chandler told CBS ""60 Minutes+"" his actions were not an attack on the country, that he went to the Capitol because he thought Donald Trump had his back and that he was peaceful inside the Capitol. JACOB CHANSLEY, DEFENDANT: I didn't break any windows. I didn't break in any doors. I didn't cross any police barricades. I was peaceful. I was civil. I was calm. I said a prayer and I sang a song. ELIE HONIG, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: He was part of that mob. We have all seen the video of that mob. They overran the police. They went into the building. That individual was charged with more than just sort of wandering around. He was charged with destruction of property. He was charged with threatening the vice president. So, reality simply doesn't line up with that defense, as creative as it is. TODD: Tonight, Democratic Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren is putting pressure on her Republican colleagues, collecting 2,000 pages' worth of provocative tweets and posts by Republicans in November, December and January, like this one from Congressman Paul Gosar January 2 -- quote -- ""Sedition and treason for stealing votes is appropriate."" Lofgren raises the idea of disciplinary action. And Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell, a former impeachment manager, is suing former President Trump, Trump's son Donald Jr., Rudy Giuliani, and Republican Congressman Mo Brooks. Swalwell's suit accuses them of inciting the attack, aiding and abetting violent rioters and inflicting emotional distress on members of Congress. One analyst says, even if the lawsuit doesn't succeed, key information could be uncovered.

2285116,2605375,CNN,The Lead With Jake Tapper,"break many color barriers in golf, he is in serious condition after this terrible crash -- Jake. TAPPER: All right, Kyung Lah, thanks so much. Stay there. We will come back to you as news warrants. Joining us to discuss is sports commentator Bob Costas. Bob, thanks for joining us. So, first of all, just Tiger, one of the most famous and successful athletes in the world, known by just as first name. What are your thoughts when you see these images of his SUV crash? BOB COSTAS, SPORTS COMMENTATOR: Well, the images obviously lead you to think the worst. But what has to be emphasized now is, beyond what we just heard, which is the most substantive news report available to us at this point, beyond that, it's all just speculative as to what happened, why it happened. We can cite as part of the backstory his previous mishaps behind the wheel of a car, but that may or may not have any relationship to this. We know that, as a golfer, apart from what may be very serious injuries now, he was already in peril of not being able to play in the upcoming Masters, said that on -- yes, on Sunday to Jim Nantz. He had his fingers crossed that he would be able to play. He's had five back surgeries, including a spinal fusion, and most recently a surgery to remove some disk fragments that were pinching on a nerve. He's 45 years old, advanced athletic age. So, we know the wonderful story that played out a couple of years ago at the Masters, when, improbably, he won his 15th major. We don't know if he'd ever be able to compete consistently at the highest levels again. So that's the athletic part of it. But now, on a personal level. We do not know -- it's apparently -- I would say apparently, based on what we just heard, not a life- threatening situation. But it could -- underline could five times -- it could be the end of his golf career, considering all the other physical challenges he had and the fact that these may be serious leg injuries, and his condition is listed now as serious. But in the meantime, Jake, everything I have been watching and hearing has the tone, perhaps understandably, of a requiem for Tiger Woods. But I think that's a leap. We just don't have enough information now to say -- to say anything beyond what we just heard a few minutes ago. TAPPER: Right. And Kyung Lah just reported that he was in serious condition, which is obviously serious, but not critical, not critical condition. COSTAS: That's right. That's right. TAPPER: Which is, as you note, a reason for his fans and, obviously, most importantly, his family he's had -- he has two children -- to be optimistic that he will survive this.

1844475,2160549,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, that's pretty much it. The important thing to keep in mind is that the reporting that that Maggie Haberman with ""The Times"" has done it is very clearly about doing things that are probably untoward but not illegal, meaning to have a conversation about testimony after the testimony was given isn't obstruction because you're not affecting the testimony, it's already happened, right? But, yes, it's just not something that should be done, but it is not surprising because the lines -- the traditional lines of protocol and what is and is not usually done are so blurred on a daily basis even and especially in this Russia investigation because we know from the reporting we've done almost for the past a year, Brooke, how frankly obsessive the president is about this, that he talks about it with his friends, that he asks questions about it. So, it shouldn't be a surprise that he also asks questions of people who have been interviewed because he still talks to people like Reince Priebus even though he left. BALDWIN: So, OK, people also surprised on this whole tariffs thing which happened at some point last week, the sort of a lower point of his week and then, all of a sudden, he starts talking about you know tariffs on steel and aluminum, tweets about some sort of event today at 3:30 at the White House, leaving people continuously sort of scrambling and wondering well what policy is there? There has been no policy. What is happening today? BASH: Well, let's see. We'll see in about an hour and a half, and I think this is to me one of like could have served a key case study of the governance of Donald Trump, because this is no small thing. I mean, this is a campaign promise he's delivering on -- BALDWIN: Right. BASH: -- to -- from his perspective -- better protect American manufacturing. It's something that he very much, though, disagrees with many people in his party. So, a more traditional president or politician or leader would have briefings have discussions private discussions with people who disagree with him in his party, here's what we're going to do, lay out what and why and kind of -- you know, be prepared for the onslaught of opposition or maybe even get some buy-in from people who support him. BALDWIN: Yes. BASH: He's got none of that. He's just going to sign this and -- BALDWIN: He wavers -- he waxes many things with -- (CROSSTALK) BASH: Exactly, which he's going back and forth with Jeff Zeleny who's at the White House. I said, is there anything that you've learned that we know?

So I think to some extent, he is taking lessons from 2016, he is learning from them and he's applying them to this cycle. But, at the same time, there is not much to suggest that he really needs to do that. I mean, he does need to court African-American voters in certain states he wants to be a formidable candidate, but to the extent that Bernie Sanders succeeded in 2016 and almost defeating the anointed Democratic nominee, I don't think he needs to change much this time around.

This comes after the president former attorney Michael Cohen gave a pretty revealing testimony about the president's finances in front of Congress last week. Joining me now to discuss is Democratic congressman from Michigan, Dan Kildee. He sits on the House Ways and Means Committee, which has the authority to directly request the president's tax returns. Congressman, good to have you this morning. REP. DAN KILDEE (D), MICHIGAN: Thank you. BLACKWELL: So, how far along in this process is the committee of trying to get the president's returns? KILDEE: Well, the committee is taking a very deliberate approach and I know some have been critical of that. But this is unchartered territory for us. We haven't use this authority to get access to a president's tax returns, the authority that the committee clearly has, but it has not been used in this fashion because candidates and presidents have always released their returns. So, we are taking our time. We had a hearing to establish the legal authority under which we can request these returns and that was pretty clear that we absolutely do have the authority to get them.

Yes, and a lot of people are still in their homes with water in the street. They're able to do that because the power grid is still up. The power grid goes down like it did in Beaumont today, and we will go to a mega disaster here in Dallas. Because the stuck is still water, if they can't get water through the water system and if you lose power and it is 93 degrees today, I think a quick assessment that you could make based on that what's in the water, that the flood water is to start looking at a selected evacuation of high risk people that are currently in the city, that's in the flood zone. If there are nursing homes and hospitals, they're at risk. It is a function of time before more of the grid go down and I think that should be highest priority of all of government, to figure those out, Erin, and start doing the high risk evacuation now, because you can still get around this city, but you need to take the risks assessment and move them because if the grid go down, we will have a mess. BURNETT: Well, I mean it's -- that's a terrifying thing to think about. And obviously the grid holding up is one of the incredible things thus far in this disaster. You point out Katrina, they called it a toxic soup and everything was in there and, of course, as we all know, horrifically even decomposing human bodies in that water. What can Texas do right now to stop it? Or at this point, it just seems like it is what it is. HONORE: Thanks for that focus. What we had every soldier, sailor, army and marine that walked in that water we did a hot soak wash down. Number one, try to avoid contact to your skin, if it does get on your skin, you wash it with hot soap, when you go into it and you come back out with your clothes, you wash them off and we go to spray points.

1715066,2030676,CNN,New Day Saturday,"Tillerson, the impact there. KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST AND SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, ""THE DAILY BEAST"": This is a disappointment for the Trump White House. They had hoped in Rex Tillerson's comments yesterday at the UN to offer a carrot, in addition to the stick of US military increased presence in the region. They had talked about offering in past administrations more than $1 billion of aid to the Korean people. So, the idea - a senior administration official explained to me - was to offer Pyongyang a narrow path out. They didn't make any specific requirements on what Pyongyang would have to do to get to talks, but they said we just want to see moves of some sort towards denuclearization. They had hoped, ala Libya and Qaddafi, when he denuclearized, that they would take this opening, but instead they got this defiant missile launch. PAUL: All right. Want to listen here real quickly to Rear Admiral John Kirby. He had some very direct words about what happened overnight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, CNN MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC ANALYST: This is Kim giving us the finger, giving China the finger, giving the UN the finger after what happened today. There's no question about that. I think the timing is absolutely planned and preordained in his mind. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAUL: Doug, you're chuckling a little bit (INAUDIBLE). Yes, yes, that's very technical, isn't it? DOUG HEYE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER RNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Yes. That's something we would expect actually the president maybe to say or to tweet about. I think one of the reasons people are so concerned, if you look at the president's tweet from this morning is now China is - it has a respected leader. During the campaign, it was bad China. It was a leader that wasn't to be respected, the currency manipulator. We need to see more clarity from this White House, especially as they are testing Donald Trump right now. BLACKWELL: Yes. I want to get to the rest of the panel, but you've actually got a piece out about the North Korea Twitter strategy. KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST AND SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, ""THE DAILY BEAST"": So, what the White House is explaining to me is that what president does is put out a tweet or an interview where he knocks down the status quo, whether it's North Korea or the wall with Mexico, and then his cabinet comes in with the strategy, the reasonable plan. So, basically, it's a high-stakes art of the deal negotiation tactic. Good cop, bad cop. Trump is the bad cop and they come in as the good cop and lands the foreign policy goals. BLACKWELL: (INAUDIBLE) in place. They don't have those at the State Department. HEYE: Exactly. And China being one of the big ones where we have the Iowa governor - BLACKWELL: Yes, Terry Branstad.

But somehow, your customers don't seem to mind. BEN BALDANZA, CEO, SPIRIT AIRLINES: Well, the reason our customers love Spirit, and why we're becoming more and more popular, is because we have the lowest fares in all the markets we serve. And even after you add all the extras that customers choose to buy, the total price they pay on Spirit is in every case lower than their next best option on another airline. So, the customers like low fares, that's why they love Spirit. QUEST: Right. Now, one of the real reasons we're talking to you tonight, besides always good to have you on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, is what you faced in the US is happening in Europe as well. Spirit, along with Southwest and others has challenged -- you've lost a challenge on US advertising rules. The US law requires you to prominently display total ticket prices instead of flagging a small fare without taxes and fees. Airlines can give separate breakdowns, but it must be in smaller size than the total cost. Now, the US Court of Appeals has rejected the argument that it violated your right to engage in commercial and political speech. So, the reason I want to ask you about this is not necessarily the minutiae of US law, but it does come down to the point, with so many taxes and so many fees from governments, isn't it right that we know what's what? BALDANZA: It is right the customers know what's what, and one of the reasons that we argued against this law -- and let me state that we've been compliant with this misguided regulation since it was put in place in January. And so, there's no near-term effect on the company as a result of losing this ruling. But the reason that we're fighting it is we think that it is very bad for consumers. It blends airline prices and government taxes into one number for consumers, so they actually lose transparency. They don't know what they're paying to the airline and what goes to the government. We like a world where you know what you're paying the airline and what you're paying the government. We'll add those together for you long before you ever have to pay. But we think that this is a step back for consumers. QUEST: OK. If we look at the airline industry at the moment in the United States, we saw Delta today with a loss on its hedging -- fuel hedging, even before its bought an oil refinery. We've seen US airlines having to -- in some difficulty. Do you expect, for example, American to consolidate with US Airways? Do you expect more consolidation? BALDANZA: Well, consolidation started a number of years ago and has happened multiple times since the US airline industry was deregulated back in",0.3013447692782167,2012-07-25

HAMMER: And then it seems like the need for attention comes along with it. I mean, just in that video we were watching, she is begging the camera man to please focus on her. She went off and she got her television show. Why is there always that urge to be at the center of attention? Is there something to it, coming from the money? JOHNSON: Well, I think as far as my experience goes and my observations, there are really two ways that wealthy people approach the media. And one way is they love the notoriety. They are always trying to get themselves in front of the camera. And then you have a slightly different way of approaching it, where people are the opposite and they`re going in the other direction. They want to stay away from the camera; they want to stay out of the limelight. And I think, more than anything, it`s really a conscious decision. You know, some people make the argument, well, I`m wealthy and it`s not my fault that I have this attention around me, and there is that level of interest. I personally don`t buy that argument. I think you - you have a choice to make. HAMMER: Yes. JOHNSON: You surround yourself with celebrities and in places where there are always photographers trying to take your picture, then, of course, you know, you`re going to get the attention of the media.

BLITZER: Jeff, what is the process inside Iraq for those 14 million who are eligible to vote? Do they have to register in advance, or just show up on January 30? KOINANGE: A lot of them, Wolf, have been registering in the weeks leading up to the election. However, election officials here do say if potential voters show up on election day and haven't registered, they will be able to register at the same day and vote. So there's no problem with that, Wolf. They're making all kinds of leeway, just so that people who haven't been able to vote because of the incessant violence, they can register and vote on the same day -- Wolf. BLITZER: All right. Jeff Koinange in Baghdad watching all of this for us. Thanks, Jeff, very much. And as Jeff just reported, voter registration for Iraq's first independent election is now under way for Iraqis living in other countries. An Iraqi woman in Australia was the first to sign up this morning. In Britain, there are reports some voters are confused by the process, asking poll workers who they should vote for. Here in the United States, Iraqi expatriates are registering in Detroit, Los Angeles, Nashville, Chicago and just outside Washington, D.C. in anticipation of the January 30 election. U.S. officials are conceding today they cannot promise absolute security for the elections. And the challenge has become especially acute in Iraq's third largest city, which is Mosul. CNN's Nic Robertson is back in Mosul. He's joining us now live via videophone with more on what's happening up in the north. What is happening up there, Nic? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, the challenges are particularly complex in Mosul because the 400- member electoral commission resigned just a few weeks ago, which really does shift the burden off to the U.S. troops here, on to the coalition to make sure that the election process goes ahead. There are (UNINTELLIGIBLE), if you will, in Mosul to make sure that the election can go ahead. There certainly is a recognition that 100 percent safety and security cannot be guaranteed. But (UNINTELLIGIBLE) being taken, there will be, for example, in the days before the elections, there will be no vehicles allowed out on the roads. The locations of election polling stations have yet to be announced. There's going to be a very careful phased announcement of information close to the elections. But the drop and the thrust of the military effort here is going to create the perception among Iraqis that election day will be safe. And they're doing that by going on the radio, stations here in Mosul, radio talk (ph) shows, talking to Iraqis, answering their questions about the elections, both U.S. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and members of Iraq's -- the Iraqi government, the Iraqi security structure here.

Cohen not only serves as President Trump's personal attorney, at least for a decade, he's also known as the President's fixer. CNN's Brian Todd is joining us. Tell us more, Brian, about what Cohen actually does for his boss. BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, we're told there's virtually nothing Michael Cohen wouldn't do for his boss. Today he endured an FBI raid, but he's also been known to threaten, to cajole, to cut any deal he needs to to get his top client out of some pretty serious jams. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL COHEN, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY: The next president of the United States of America. TODD (voice-over): Michael Cohen says he will always protect his client, Donald Trump. COHEN: He's a good man. He's a man who cares deeply about this country. TODD (voice-over): For 12 years, Cohen has been Trump's personal attorney, or, as many call him, Trump's fixer. One former Trump campaign official says Cohen is a less cool version of Ray Donovan, show time's fictional Hollywood fixer. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. Oh, Jesus, Ray. TODD (voice-over): But if Cohen is less cool than Donovan, observers say he's every bit as tenacious. MARC FISHER, CO-AUTHOR, ""TRUMP REVEALED"": Michael Cohen is not averse to threatening people, he's a guy who carries a pistol in an ankle holster. He makes it clear to people that he's a tough guy. TODD (voice-over): From sometimes ruthlessly maneuvering against people who have damaging information on Trump to trying to facilitate business deals for his boss, observers say Michael Cohen consistently doggedly displays the one characteristic Donald Trump values most. FISHER: There's very little in the world that's more important to Donald Trump than loyalty and Michael Cohen has shown for more than a decade that he will hold confidences and that he will fight for Trump in the way that Trump likes and that is to hit hard, to always hit back harder than you've been hit. TODD (voice-over): Cohen recently said he used his own personal funds to, quote, facilitate a payment to the porn star shortly before the 2016 election without Trump's knowledge or reimbursement. Something legal experts say is almost unheard of. MARK GERAGOS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: It is extraordinary and I would tell you that probably 99.9 percent of the lawyers in America would never even contemplate doing this. TODD (voice-over): In response, Cohen tells CNN his legal arguments and documents in the Daniels case are airtight and that he believes its Daniels who's now liable for millions in damages based on her conduct.

He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. PENCE: Ours is an insult-driven campaign? I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables.

STELTER: The shifting stories about the rationale for the strike is something that we're going to -- we're going to continue to talk about in the next segment. It's remarkable to see the president to say that he believes something was going to happen without citing the intelligence. And this relates to broader access of U.S. government officials, and that involves press briefings. Admiral Kirby, you were one of 12 -- one of 13 former press secretaries from the White House, Pentagon, State Department, come out with this letter, this open letter titled: Why America needs to hear from its government. Here are the names of the others who signed the letter, including notably Scott McClellan, who was a Bush press secretary. So, there were a couple of Republican names on this letter. Why did you feel this needed to be written now? What are the benefits of briefings that are being lost right now? KIRBY: I think press briefings, we wrote about this in the letter, not only provide a measure of accountability for the government, and scrutiny of the decisions that they are making, but it also helps makes better decisions. It helps the policy making process when you have the ideas churned out there in the free press every single day. When I was the Pentagon press secretary, I briefed twice a week. And I thought that was pretty, pretty adequate. When I went to the State and realized there was a daily press briefing, I actually asked the staff, do we need to do this every day? I was glad we kept it going, because there's so much going on in the world, and it's important for the United States to have a voice, to have a say, to put out these policies. More critically, I found that we as a State Department made better decisions because we were getting the constant scrutiny from the press. And when you look -- you ask why now, when you look at where are in the foreign policy of this country, particularly vis-a-vis Iran, it doesn't appear that the policy decision-making process was, in fact, very robust. And it needs to be challenged because the tensions with Iran aren't getting any lower right now and I think we need to -- I think the American people have a right to know that the kind of decisions that their elected leaders are making have been informed by context and deeper understanding. We're not getting any of that, because there's no daily briefing, no way to ask a spokesperson every single day how these decisions are being processed.

Faking your own death to get out of your Verizon contract? AVERY: You know people around me ask all the time because I do measurement. Is $5.1 million really a reasonable amount to charge for that and why would a brand ever do it? Yes, you`re buying exposure but that`s not really what you`re buying there. You`re buying access into conversation. You`re buying access into a memorable experience. You`re triggering emotion. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh man.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get zero percent financing for 60 months. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But for most of the things that you buy everyday, you don`t really think about why you`re doing it. It`s that brief moment before you grab a product off the shelf that those countless ads you`ve seen over and over and over again take effect. Should you go with the cheaper brand that you`ve never heard of or the more expensive brand you saw on TV? So there was this study done and - - and it took two items that were exactly the same but one had a brand on it that people knew and the other one was the same product without the brand. People preferred the exact same item branded by 24 percent, cut to four years later and that brand slashed their ad budget. The same test was done and the brand`s perceived quality was cut in half. (INAUDIBLE AD) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One of the reasons for this is that not only does not advertising make your product seem less desirable, it also raises the perceived quality of your cheaper, generic competitors. Your perception of the difference between product you know X and product you`ve never heard of Y, it shrinks. And advertising is not just meant to make you go out and buy something, yes, that is a big part of it but it also works to make people happier with the purchase that they already made. People in the ad world call this reinforcement. You want to know that the thing you bought is good and seeing an ad makes you enjoy the product that you already have more. So there are ads on TV make you feel better about the purchase you might think the item is worth. AVERY: So when people talk about how it doesn`t work, I`m like mathematically it does. I mean, they wouldn`t keep doing it. These companies are massive companies with a lot of investment behind making sure that it`s working and tracking if it`s not.

We will get out there and let them know they have our support and bring them as much entertainment as we can. KELLEY: That's marvelous to support that. Have you had a chance to talk to some of the other performers tonight about how they feel about this and the importance of performing? BLACK: No. I have spoken to a few of my friends, not at the event today. It's been pretty crazy, everybody is running so many different directions. It's very, very satisfying to find that all of our feelings seem to be the same, and we all want to wave our flag high. KELLEY: Well, we wish you much success tonight.

WISENBERG: -- obviously in consultation with the President, they were looking at the Mueller probe as primarily about a conspiracy with the Russians and members of the campaign to effect the election or to hack computers. It's now clear that Bob Mueller is focused much more on obstruction of justice and that Mueller has a very, very broad view of obstruction, and I would be very, very worried, and very scared to go in and talk to Bob Mueller. And keep in mind, Bob Mueller's people have indicted four people for lying to Bob Mueller, lying to his investigators, four people. So if he wasn't the president, let's put it this way, any white collar attorney in D.C. would tell you, you would be crazy to let your client go in and talk to the prosecutors under these set of facts. HARLOW: And Laura, you know, I think one of the reasons that Solomon is noting this that it was really a lens of collusion at that point and not an obstruction lens they were looking through, let's remember the role that Don McGahn played in protecting Mueller, if you will. When the President, in New York Times reported, wanted to fire Mueller, McGahn said, you do that, I'll quit, I'll walk out. So he has, you know, obviously talked to Mueller's team about the questions surrounding the desire of the President to fire Mueller. COATES: Absolutely. And I think Don McGahn has done an artful way of trying to show that he is the one transparent last line of defense in the White House. And whether that's entirely true, Poppy, in the end, I guess we don't know. But 30 hours is a long time to talk to the investigators. And if the focal point of Robert Mueller's entire probe was on obstruction, I would be shocked. Obstruction is almost never the focal point. It happens to be one that's a tangential claim that can be added on, but the real meat of the matter is what it is you'd like me to stop investigating, why you want my attention to be diverted. So I suspect, the overwhelming in that information that McGahn spoke to him about was probably in line with, one, he has no attorney-client privilege to protect the conversation. HARLOW: Right. COATES: He could, I assume, talk about executive privilege, if that could be actually applied which it can't be in this case. But also remember, Don McGahn is a campaign finance expert, was once on the SEC as a commissioner. And so he probably has information and insight who he -- the role he played on the campaign, and about whether there was any in kind contribution, which I'm sure are of interest to Mueller's team. HARLOW: Sure, which also would tie back perhaps to Michael Cohen if we",0.4240955559086816,2018-08-20

Will retrieving the black boxes be comparatively easy next to this month-long search for wreckage? DAVID GALLO, CNN ANALYST: It is hard to say, Anderson, again without having a real good map of the sea floor we don't have one. I'm assuming that the ""Echo"" is out there. It is a very capable hydrographic sensor, it has all the elements to make the map. The shape of the sea floor as well as things that can penetrate the sea floor to tell you how much sediment is there. And we'll have the idea what the texture is like if the boxes may have sunk into silt or if they're sitting in rubble or canyons or crevices, so again, we'll have to wait until we have more information. COOPER: Richard, if you take a step back and look at where the pings are, where it is believed the plane has ended up, it is still so mind boggling why it took that route. Why it ended up in that isolated area so far from where it was supposed to be. QUEST: Five weeks ago tonight, while we're talking it was doing it. I mean, that is the long and short of it and the incident had happened by now. And we have got to get to those flight data recorders to know what happened.

(END VIDEO CLIP) STEINHAUSER: I think you're going to hear a lot more of that between now and November 2nd, which is election day. YELLIN: And they're tied in that race right now, the latest polling. Don't they seem to be neck and neck? STEINHAUSER: Yes, polls suggest that it's pretty much dead even. And jobs not just in Nevada but also elsewhere in the country. Wherever the high unemployment rate exists, you're going to hear about jobs. YELLIN: Now, Peter, President Obama clearly inherited this economy, but unemployment remains very high right now. Is it -- you're probably going to say it is fair to blame him for the current unemployment rate. MORICI: Well, unemployment's certainly gone up a lot since President Obama took over, and he's gotten everything he wanted -- you know, this huge stimulus package, $800 billion worth, a $1.6 trillion deficit, rock bottom interest rates and easy credit to the banks from the Fed, bank reform, but yet businesses don't want to invest because they're fearful of his regulatory hand, and many folks have quit looking for jobs altogether because they're plain discouraged. YELLIN: Well, Paul, what are -- what are the Republicans liabilities here? How can Democrats run against this economy and say, really, it's not their fault? STEINHAUSER: It's tough because even though polls suggest that Americans still blame the previous administration for getting us into this mess, it's more and more every day becoming Barack Obama's economy.

So, it's not really -- HABERMAN: No. I mean, look, that -- first of all, I think that Nunberg is on the record on that anecdote, at least in some fashion. So that doesn't seem completely out of line. I think that there are several areas where there is something that notionally accurate but the facts are not quite right. I mean, he got -- and I hate to take it back to this, just standing on my head, he got minor things -- shots he took at other media outlets, he just got basic details wrong about stories, about things. And, you know, I worked with a lot of journalists early in my career who could talk about dealing in larger truths. The actual details do matter especially if you are going to report that these are quotes from people and he claims as Michael said to have -- he paints these scenes of 500-word exchanges of dialogue. COOPER: Right. But let's talk about -- with Steve Bannon, why would Steve Bannon go after -- say these things about the president. I mean, he was -- you know, so close to him all during this campaign. What is going on? What's the strategy? HABERMAN: I think a couple of things. I don't know how much of it is a strategy per se. I think Bannon had genuine frustration about the way the White House was run. I think he and Jared Kushner butted heads. We saw that throughout 2017 and there was really nobody to kind of orbit the Wild West that was the West Wing. John Kelly made a huge difference once he came in as chief of staff. In terms of how the staff function, he obviously has not changed the behavior of the president. You can just look at Twitter for that. But it became a different place and the one thing that I do think became a unifying factor for White House staff members in 2017, was they all became unified against Steve Bannon. You saw that today in their statements, too. I think Bannon feels like he has nothing left to lose and also I think he is aware, A, that they are watching him very warily about how he's going to try to run the slate of candidates in 2018, outsider candidates and insurgents in the midterms. And then he is going to paint himself as the king maker and the counter balance and perhaps rightful inheritor of the Trump movement.

The Reverend James Martin is a New York-based Jesuit and author. He is back with us now. This is an extraordinary moment. Just as we were anticipating, wow, how does this communion for 45,000 take place within the predicted 15 minutes, actually take place? And it looks like they just might be wrapping up this communion. Well, Reverend, is this the homily, is this the mass that you expected? And is this what the Catholic Church, what the American people needed now? Particularly on this pope's first visit to the U.S.? MARTIN: Well, I think part of the homily was expected, in the sense that he spoke a great deal about hope. He obviously talked about the gospel readings. But by the same token, I think people were surprised, again, that he brought up the sex abuse crisis. And I was very gratified that he did, because this was his opportunity to speak to the faithful directly about the abuse crisis. So I think that was something of a surprise for, once again, Catholics in the United States who may not have thought that he was going to bring up the topic at all during his trip. But this is the third time. So I think he did a wonderful job of the homily, tying it together with the theme of hope, as well as mentioning some pain in the church. WHITFIELD: And he spoke directly to individuals, saying, ""It's up to you individuals to help foster this healing and reconciliation."" But this was -- these were words that perhaps were directed at the Catholic Church as a whole, as well. Our Ed Henry underscoring earlier, so many diocese have really suffered financially from the blows of the sexual abuse cases, as has the reputation of the church as a whole. How will the pope's words really help re-inject a kind of hope or faith in the Catholic Church when so many have been hurt and so many have been terribly bruised? MARTIN: Well, it's a very difficult thing to do. You know, he talked last night to the bishops, asking them to do their part. And now he's saying that the Catholic faithful have to help one another heal. Obviously, they're not the ones that were responsible, but they are asked to bring healing and reconciliation. So I think any time that the pope speaks, you know, he's speaking, you know, for the entire church to these poor victims. And to offer a message of hope and reconciliation. It has to help, if in a small way. It's not the end of the healing, but it may be another step towards healing this horrible --",0.1939814814814814,2008-04-17

That's significant, though, because it suggests the president realizes, that we talk about the House bills, the other Senate bills, the only thing matters is what the Senate Finance Committee does. That's why Dana has been parked outside that committee room for the last few days and it's because unless you can get a consensus from that committee and then you get 60 or 65, some Republicans as well as Democrats to support it in the Senate, nothing else matters. DANA BASH, CNN SR. CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, the blisters on my feet, you can see them, they are pretty bad. But in getting those blisters, I have been able to talk to a lot of those senators meeting and negotiating and on that issue of this relatively new idea of taxing the high cost insurance plans. There's no question that that is gaining steam and that is absolutely on the table and a part of what they are trying to crack. Here's the problem. The challenge, the big challenge is paying for the trillion dollar price tag for health care and what they have been initially talking about, taxing benefits, that was about $310 billion. That was a big chunk of change. I talked to Max Baucus, the finance chairman, about this plan. And he said that the revenue generated from taxing insurance companies, he said it doesn't even come close to that. So that's why they are still in that room, they're meeting because that is still a big problem. How do you pay for it? They don't have the answers yet. JOE JOHNS, CNN SR. CORRESPONDENT: The critique on that, though is that even though they say they are taxing the companies, it's still really a tax on benefits at the end of the day and everybody knows that. On the other side, those it is cost-cutting, so it's attractive at least because other talking about wealthy people here that keep throwing in -- BASH: And the insurance companies. JOHNS: Right. So maybe it can reach them and the middle class won't complain. HENRY: The insurance company is likely to pass that cost on to you. KING: Let's just for the sake of argument, assume they figure this part out, at least in the Senate Finance Committee, and we'll talk more about the House calculation in a minute. But then there's the other thing, the public option. So even if Republicans went along with a plan that taxed the Cadillac plans some other way, there's still the public option which the Democrats say is central. A public insurance, a government insurance plan to compete against private insurance.

A deputy, a school resource officer forced out for allegedly doing nothing when the shots rang out. Also on the table is arming teachers and paying them bonuses to pack guns, the answer the President thinks so. You'll see what a former top law enforcer thinks. Also new charges on against Paul Manafort and his former top aide, well, to persuade one or both to flip. And later, why President Trump said today he's thinking about pulling every immigration customs enforcement agent out of California. We begin with the Parkland story that left Broward County sheriffs at a total loss for words. The fact that a school resource officer stayed outside the building when the shooting began. Martin Savidge joins us now with the latest. Martin? MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Anderson, this school resource officer is a sheriff's deputy. He is in uniform and he carries a gun. This particular deputy, Scott Peterson had been on this campus since 2009. He was on the campus at the time of the shooting. And the question had been where was he during the time of the murders that were taking place? Today, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said that a review had determined something very disturbing, the fact that the officer was right outside the building where the shooting was taking place. He was aware of something awful going on on the inside and he did not go in. In fact, a review finds that he was outside that building for up to four minutes. Remember the entire attack took just six minutes. The sheriff himself was sickened by what he saw. Here's what he said earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL, BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA: Devastated, sick to my stomach. There are no words. These families lost their children. We lost coaches. I've been to the funerals. I've been to the homes where they're sitting shiver. I've been to the vigils. It's just there are no words. (END VIDEO CLIP) SAVIDGE: Remember, Anderson, that ever since Columbine, that was 19 years ago, the protocol for law enforcement has been any armed officer, any officer that first arrives or is there on scene must interact with an active shooter if only to distract, hopefully to engage. The sheriff said he should have engaged, should have killed that shooter. Instead, the officer did nothing. He was put on what was supposed to be suspension, instead the officer said he resigned and immediately went into retirement, Anderson. COOPER: Martin Savidge, stunning report. Appreciate that.

VELEZ-MITCHELL: To have the wherewithal to call 911 and then describe where she lived and the whole situation. And yet, she`s probably going to feel some irrational guilt, because as a result, she and her two siblings have been taken from the home and put into protective custody.

Is it actually news in the sense that this is the first we've heard of this or are the Pentagon do you think now briefing this is a reality? NICHOLAS KRISTOF, NEW YORK TIMES COLUMNIST: Well, there have been reports already that Syria has weaponized its sarin, it's a nerve gas, already into Scud missiles, into artillery, and in the bombs. And these have been going on for, in fact, I noticed that CNN two days reported something similar. But there seem to be more of these reports that the chemicals for nerve gas are being united. Normally they are stored separately to keep them safe. And there seems to be more of these reports of mixing, which is pretty troubling. Which is pretty alarming. MORGAN: Larry Kudlow, here's my problem. I remember covering back in Britain, the Iraq war buildup. And we had almost exactly the same pattern. You know, bad guy has chemical weapons about to use them on his people. We have to do something. Turned out to be a load of twaddle. How do we know this intelligence is true?

But there's a lot of reporting that these chemical weapons of mass destruction came in nearly in 2000s. Came in in 2003, 2004 with the assistance of the Russians. OK, I can't verify that.

The Central American Free Trade Agreement, or CAFTA, has become so controversial that the president will not ask Congress to vote on it until after the November election. Peter Viles reports from Los Angeles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): CAFTA is the centerpiece of the Bush administration's trade agenda, but the president is now telling his allies that CAFTA will have to wait a while. This was Monday. The president of El Salvador met with President Bush and then told reporters he gets the message: CAFTA is too hot a topic for a presidential election year. PRESIDENT ANTONIO BACA, EL SALVADOR (through translator): Bush is aware that CAFTA is very important, but, given the upcoming elections, we will have to revisit the issue with CAFTA. VILES: Democrats have been saying for months that CAFTA is in so much trouble in Congress that it won't even come up this year. This was key Democrat Charlie Rangel back in May. REP. CHARLES RANGEL (D), NEW YORK: Even the president's people are beginning to say that this is a loser if the president signs it, but the committee hasn't got enough votes really to do anything with it. VILES: Republican leadership still supports CAFTA. They just don't appear to have the votes in their own party to push it through, not with trade tensions rising and the trade deficit running at a record pace, all of which means CAFTA's survival may now hinge on the president's reelection in November because Democrat John Kerry has already voiced strong opposition to CAFTA. The day it was signed, he called it ""a disappointing and unnecessary step backwards that will actually make the current trade situation worse."" (END VIDEOTAPE) VILES: Now the House today did approve a free trade deal with Australia, but that is a much less controversial agreement mainly because we run a trade surplus with Australia and, also, Senator Kerry has endorsed that agreement -- Lou. DOBBS: Well, those surpluses are so rare, one would think there would be a lot of bipartisan support for that agreement. VILES: Big vote in the House.

And that is one of the things that we've asked 25 senators and I've led this letter with Senator Jack Reed saying where is this data going, how are you going to protect it? BROWN: And of course as Laura reported, the commission says the data will be protected, that it's using a secure military app to make sure that everything is secure, but would you be as concerned, Senator, if the Obama administration had asked for this information? KLOBUCHAR: Well, I would because under several administrations now, we've seen hacks of data, both in the private sector and in the government sector. And for one thing, we know that the Obama administration was much more focused on making it easier for people to vote. And this commission in fact, has taken a different stand. And because of the Supreme Court, drawing out part of the Voting Rights Act, we've now have over 20 states that put limitations on voting. And we've, in fact, major Courts, Circuit Courts say that these states have been - and this is a quote from the 4th Circuit-been discriminating with surgical precision. So what the real problem is, is that we're making it very hard for some people to vote. I love my state, we've got the highest voter turnout in the country and it works. And we'd like to see that kind of thing in other states. What this commission is doing, is actually saying, we have major problem with voter fraud when study after study has shown that's not the case.

Politico is reporting that the health care bill vote has been now moved back another week. What role do you see the Democrats playing in this? KLOBACHAR: Well the Democrats have been united from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin in the United States Senate in saying that the bill that we got that was put together behind closed-doors by 13 guys was not a bill that going to helm the American people. Not only were we shut out, the American people were shut out when they close those doors. And so, there's no surprise that we've now seen major pushback.

That's swagger was something his Wharton classmates noticed decades ago.

He said, ""I'm going to be the next Bill Zeckendorf of Manhattan real estate, but I'm going to be better. I remember seeing the expression on my classmates faces.

Louis Calamares (ph), a Republican, who doesn't want to say who he's voting for, took real estate classes with Trump, and Calamares noticed early Trump's knock for marketing.

24371,26669,CNN,Worldview,"JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: The government of Sierra Leone now says U.S. presidential envoy Jesse Jackson is welcome to visit the troubled West African country. Earlier, the government had warned him to stay away because he had said that rebel leader Foday Sankoh should be included in reconciliation efforts. Jackson is touring West Africa in a bid to ease tensions in Sierra Leone, where rebels recently shattered last year's peace accord by taking U.N. peacekeepers hostage. CNN's Ben Wedeman spoke with Sierra Leone's president, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah on Friday and asked him about the peace agreement and other pressing issues. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AHMED TEJAN KABBAH, PRESIDENT OF SIERRA LEONE: The agreement may be in some difficulties, but as far as we are concerned we signed it. I signed it on behalf of the government of Sierra Leone. Foday Sankoh signed it on behalf of the RUF. Now I'm an individual. If I should die now or something happens to me or I am no longer president of Sierra Leone, that agreement will still be valid. So I think we have to separate the two issues, the individuals from the agreement. As far as we're concerned, the agreement is a good agreement. It contains lots and lots of provisions which are very good for this country. For example, some institutions that have been created in it are very vital. Take the commission for the structured (UNINTELLIGIBLE) mineral resource commission. Now diamonds is one of our problems in this country, and the rebels have been stealing our diamonds together with all the people from outside, Sierra Leone, stealing our diamonds, buying arms and fueling the war. And this has been going on for a very long time. So in that agreement there is provision in that agreement to see how best we can overcome that problem so that our mineral resources can be used for the benefit of the people of this country. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now Mr. Sankoh is now in government hands. What are you going to do with him? Will you include him in government once again, or will you, as many people here are asking, put him on trial? KABBAH: Well this is a democratic country, and we have opted for the rule of law, which should prevail in our country. And, say somebody has committed a crime, that person will have to face the full force of the law. Even the president of this country is subject to the laws of this country. So at the moment we have an investigation going on into what happened on the 8th of this month. You know that Sankoh was on the loose for quite some time, and there were other people who were with him who are still on the run. So we want to be able to marshal the evidence to come to the conclusion as to what has happened.

He did not go any further than that when pressed, obviously, but he held all of our attention at those words, Wolf, the first we've heard of it. BLITZER: I have -- I think you probably have it, as well. Let me read it to our viewers. The precise words -- this is very significant. And Senator Hirono is standing by. Let me read to you what the acting attorney general said: ""I've been fully briefed on the investigation. I look forward to Director Mueller delivering the final report. I really am not going to talk about open ongoing investigations otherwise, but sort of -- but sort of the statements I made were as a private citizen, only with publicly available information. And I am comfortable that the decisions that were made are going to be reviewed through the various means we have. But right now, the investigation is, I think, close to being completed, and I hope that we can get the report from Director Mueller as soon as possible."" Tell our viewers, Laura, why he decided to speak publicly on the state of the Mueller investigation. JARRETT: Well, it's interesting, Wolf. We weren't sure exactly what he would say. This is the first we have heard from Whitaker since he assumed the role of acting attorney general. And we weren't sure he was actually going to take questions at all. As usually -- sometimes Justice Department officials in -- at least in the past couple months have gotten up there and departed shortly after. But he stayed for a while taking questions on a variety of issues, did not shy away from anything related to the Mueller investigation. But the real question is whether it's even going to be up to him, as of course, the president has nominated Bill Barr to be the permanent attorney general. And he is scheduled for a vote later -- early next month, I should say, in the Senate Judiciary Committee. So this may not be up to Whitaker at all, what happens with the Mueller investigation. But for now, he does still technically oversee it. So anything, of course, that he says about it or as he weighs in on it is certainly significant. BLITZER: Certainly is significant, because he says he has been briefed on the state of the Mueller investigation, and once again, he says it's close to being completed. Stand by. I know you're getting more information, Laura. I want to go back to Senator Mazie Hirono right now. You heard the precise statement that the acting attorney general made. HIRONO: Yes. BLITZER: I'll give you a chance to respond. HIRONO: Well, this is an administration, starting with the president, who has continued to call the Mueller investigation a witch hunt. And he -- the president handpicked Whitaker because of his comments about the Mueller investigation that comported with the president's. So I would hesitate",0.095020325203252,2019-01-28

Yet they have some of the highest crime rates, which goes back to prove the point a lot of people said was, law-abiding citizens are not the issue here. They will register their guns, and they will pay the taxes to have them registered. And it doesn't mean that it's going to make the city safer and Chicago is a perfect example of that. And that's where I think a lot of people say, maybe passing more laws is not doing very much, instead of going after the bad guys that buy the guns illegally on the black market in the first place. BALDWIN: You know, I wanted to know... SIROTA: What I would say to that... (CROSSTALK) BALDWIN: Go ahead, respond to him. And then I'm going to jump in with a poll. SIROTA: Very quickly, what I would just say is that citing Chicago's crime statistics presupposes that those crime statistics are driven by its gun laws, as opposed to asking the question, how much worse could the situation be if those gun laws weren't on the books, especially considering the recent study that show that the states that have the toughest gun laws tend to have the least amount of gun violence? (CROSSTALK) BALDWIN: Let me point out, hang on, because I wanted to know just how Americans think. I know how you two feel. We asked about keeping a national list of gun owners; 44 percent said the federal government should use background checks to create a list; 55 percent said no. That was just something from a couple of months ago. But I want to move on, and, David, it's interesting you're in Colorado. I talked to Angela Giron. She was one of the two state senators who was recently ousted in that recall there. I know she made it crystal clear to me she thought that that loss was about voter suppression and the complication of just what was exactly on the ballot. But another point that others have definitely made is that when you look at the -- you think money would win, but in this case, it didn't. You had this plumber ultimately, and even the powerful lobbying group the NRA against Mayor Bloomberg, the billionaire, and his mega-group who outspent the NRA, yet still, you see what happened in the outcome of this election. If it's not about money here, what is winning this debate? SIROTA: I think it's intensity. When you look at -- there was a recent Pew survey that showed that people who own guns and who consider themselves pro-gun are more single-issue voters on that issue than people who are for gun control.

That there is systems of justice and rules that service all of us, that police are not able to treat us like enemy combatants in our whole communities and in the case of Breonna Taylor, in her own home. HOLMES: Yes. What questions do you have about the information the grand jury was given and we don't know what information was put forward and prosecutors control that information.

ROBINSON: So here's the thing if you or I or the viewers at home had killed somebody in their home, there wouldn't be a grand jury needed to arrest us, right? To put us behind bars, we wouldn't need all that process. In fact we would be arrested so we actually already start with two systems of justice, right?

We end up in a situation where the prosecutors in these cases need police in order to do their job day to day and so are going to find ways to work with police and so not only do we not know what happened in the grand jury but we have to question the use of the grand juries in and of themselves time and time again when black folks are hurt and harmed by police. We saw it in Fergusson Missouri, we see it around the country that grand juries are deployed in order to create this sort of barrier between the prosecutor actually doing their job and bringing charges and bringing these things to trial in order to create these shields and then because of how the grand jury process works. We don't even know how hard the prosecutor fought to actually get a conviction, whether or not this was something that they sort of put the time, energy and resources behind because what we did see all along the way was the police department trying to do things the prosecutor's office trying to do things to sow a gap in our minds about whether or not Breonna Taylor was worthy of our empathy, worthy of justice.

Its goal was for each African nation to vaccinate 10 percent of its population by September.

I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans, independents, for people who vote for me, for people who don't, for all Americans. That is what I think we need. We need to unify our country and go forward into the future with confidence and optimism. (APPLAUSE) Today I want you to know a little bit about where I stand and how I see the world and America's place in it. I spent four years as your Secretary of State, eight years before that as Senator from the great state of New York, six years on the Senate Armed Services Committee. If there's one core belief that has guided and inspired me every step of the way, it is this. The United States is an exceptional nation. I believe we are still Lincoln's last, best hope of Earth. We're still Reagan's shining city on a hill. We're still Robert Kennedy's great, unselfish, compassionate country. And it's not just that we have the greatest military or that our economy is larger than any on Earth. It's also the strength of our values, the strength of the American people. Everyone who works harder, dreams bigger and never, ever stops trying to make our country and the world a better place. And part of what makes America an exceptional nation, is that we are also an indispensable nation. In fact, we are the indispensable nation. People all over the world look to us and follow our lead. My friends, we are so lucky to be Americans. It is an extraordinary blessing. It's why so many people, from so many places, want to be Americans too. But it's also a serious responsibility. The decisions we make and the actions we take, even the actions we don't take, affect millions even billions of lives. You know that; you've seen it. Now all of this may seem evident, especially to men and women who have worn the uniform. You may wonder how anyone could disagree. But, in fact, my opponent in this race has said very clearly that he thinks American exceptionalism is insulting to the rest of the world. In fact, when Vladimir Putin, of all people, criticized American exceptionalism, my opponent agreed with him, saying, and I quote, ""if you're in Russia, you don't want to hear that America is exceptional."" Well maybe you don't want to hear it, but that doesn't mean it's not true. My opponent misses something important. When we say America is exceptional, it doesn't mean that people from other places don't feel deep national pride, just like we do. It means that we recognize America's unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress, a champion for freedom and opportunity. Our power comes with a responsibility to lead, humbly, thoughtfully, and with a fierce commitment to our values. Because, when America fails to lead, we leave a vacuum that either causes chaos or other countries or networks rush in to fill the void. So",0.2216356360493734,2016-08-31

I`m sure if you were her defense attorney, you would have a psychologist, psychiatrist in there with her right now to get her state of mind because you`re going to say that she has issues with her, probably competency, and also that she was just out of her mind when she did this. TROY SLATEN, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Not necessarily, Jean. Maybe she was trying on protect her children. When you talk about a parent, a bond between a mother... CASAREZ: Is that normal? SLATEN: ... and her children... CASAREZ: She`s trying to protect her children so she murders them? SLATEN: She may have been. CASAREZ: That`s a person that`s in her right mind, that knows right from wrong? SLATEN: We don`t know for sure whether she murdered them, Jean. She is charged with their murder. We don`t know if she did it. We know that there is another man, this neighbor, who was often trying to help her, who also went missing around the same time. So it seems like there may have been something strange, a strange relationship between this 66-year-old recently divorced man and this 29-year-old woman. Now, she went to the police on her own. She wasn`t necessarily turning herself in. Maybe she was going there for help. CASAREZ: OK. Dr. Ish Major, you are a psychologist (sic). Put this all together for us, all right? A mother doesn`t have custody of her children, so she takes them and she murders them! You take them, you want them. You don`t want to kill them! DR. ISH MAJOR, PSYCHIATRIST: Well, if you take them, you want them. What this tells me, Jean, is the urgency, the property destruction -- that tells me she was in an agitated state, right? And so the question is why. Now, we know she`s got a history of drug use, and we know she lost custody of those children. So it`s not uncommon for folks, either under the influence or as a result of that, to have paranoid delusions, to have command hallucinations, hearing voices telling them to do things. I had a woman in the hospital just a month ago. She almost beat her mother to death while she was high under the influence of methamphetamine, telling her her mother was a demon. So we don`t know what type of state she was in. But my hunch tells me it had something to do with under the influence of drugs. CASAREZ: And that`s what I`m saying. You`d want a psychologist, psychiatrist in there to see the state of mind at this moment. Thank you very much. A manhunt for the suspect who kidnaps a 2-year-old Rocky Mount, North Carolina, girl.

And tonight, Wolf, insurance companies, the insurance industry, is raising questions about how practically this fix can be implemented, saying that it will create instability in the market and could also result in higher premiums, more expensive premiums, for Americans purchasing insurance on the exchanges, Wolf. BLITZER: Brianna Keilar at the White House, you're absolutely right. Thanks very much. Washington State, by the way, is already rejecting the president's plan. The insurance commissioner in Washington State says it's too late right now. He says his state will stay the course. Almost 300,000 Washington State residents will have to get new policies. And a top insurance industry trade association says the president's fix could actually destabilize the insurance market. And Karen Ignagni is joining us right now. She's chief executive officer of the America' Health Insurance Industry, chief representative here in Washington. Karen, thanks very much for coming in. KAREN IGNAGNI, PRESIDENT AND CEO, AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS: Thanks, Wolf. BLITZER: Do you agree with what the president said today? IGNAGNI: Well, we have some concerns about today and essentially what it boils down to is this is changing the rules in the ninth inning of the baseball game. And the reason is that what the plans have already submitted their premiums with the expectation that there's a mix of older and younger people, healthy and sick, to balance the pools so that we can have affordable rates for consumers. And what it boils down to today, we're concerned about the issue of affordability for consumers. BLITZER: So, are your members going to go along with this so-called fix the president put forward today? IGNAGNI: Well, the decisions are up to state insurance commissioners. As you know, they regulate health insurance marketplaces across the country in 50 states. They'll make decisions. Some of them have already indicated they're moving in certain directions. But they'll be the decision makers here in terms of what are the rules of the game in a particular state. BLITZER: Is it doable if you say this is the ninth inning of a baseball game and they want to rewrite the rules? Is it practical? Is it doable? IGNAGNI: Well, here's -- you're getting to the issue that our members are very concerned about. We have -- and let me go back by comparison. I think you've covered very well over the years that states try to construct risk pools, try to reform their insurance markets, and what we saw in states where there were only older and sicker people entering the risk pools, the markets blew up. No one wants that. We don't want that. Our top priority is to get affordable coverage to all Americans. BLITZER: Well,",0.1105823647207348,2013-11-14

And the conservatives went, ""What?"" And then right at the same time, Harriet Miers. BECK: You know, I saw the most amazing headline today, the most frightening headline I saw today, was we just had second biggest month for income for the Unite States government in April. The IRS took in more money, the second highest month of all time. And yet, they`re still talking in Washington, ""I don`t know if we should continue with tax cuts. We can`t afford it."" Are you kidding me? You have this huge economy. You`re making all kinds of money, but the Republicans and the Democrats spending money like they`re crazy. MOWBRAY: Glenn, when is up -- when is up down, when is down up? In Washington. BECK: Right now. MOWBRAY: Right now. The reason -- you`re right, by the way, tax rates -- the tax revenues, excuse me, to the government are up. The second highest level ever, just this past April. You know what the highest was? April of 2001, just before the bubble burst. The reason why you have all this tax revenue pouring in, is because people are buying and selling more capital stocks than they were at a higher tax rate. So when it`s cheaper to do something, you buy more of it. And so people are buying and selling stocks a lot more often, or they`re buying stocks that pay dividends, because the dividend tax rate is so much lower. As a result, tax revenue goes up. But what happens when Washington debates the extension of this very tax cut and they say, ""Oh, no, it`s going to cost the government money?"" No, it`s not. Simple history tells us we get more money. Now, Glenn, I`m not happy, and I doubt you`re happy when the government gets more money, but the fact is it happens. BECK: Joel, I appreciate it. Thank you so much. We`ll have you back on again.

This is hard to take, because I know we made mistakes on the Affordable Health Care Act, Mr. Secretary. And one of the criticisms we got over and over again that the vote was partisan. Well, you couldn't have a more partisan exercise than what you're engaged right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAUL: Are the Dems being shut out of the ACHA decision-making? ALLEN: What was the beginning of the question, Christi? PAUL: Are the Democrats being shut out? Is the Republican health care plan that they are crafting, is it too partisan? ALLEN: I would hope not. It would be great to get some Democratic support on it. I do see possibilities for Democratic support on infrastructure, workforce training, and also tax reform. The -- on this issue, what the Republicans stand, I suppose if you're trying to figure it out, is what they passed in the House of Representatives. And I do think it's important to the extent they can get any Democrat to support ideas that give more competition, more choice for people in health care, I think association ought to be able to provide insurance. People band together in a larger group so you have, you know, economies to scale and more negotiating with insurance companies. PAUL: So, you -- ALLEN: I think the Republicans ought to look what Senator McCaskill said is, all right, here's what we're doing, what can you go along with in these ideas? And maybe she will, maybe she won't. But I guarantee you, Leader McConnell would like to get as many votes as he can.

Because we don't know whether the offer exists, Greece may well have defaulted vis-a-vis the IMF and the Europeans have said that the deal exists until Tuesday. So was this a calculated move or even a sensible move? Absolutely not. What's worse, there were indications that even members of the negotiating team of the Greek government had pretty much converged and what has leaked, which is quite embarrassing for the Greek government is that what was presented as an ultimatum by the Greek government was not an ultimatum. And the head of the commission actually sent the text that was better than the one that was being discussed because the negotiations were still going on. Why did it happen? Party politics, purely entirely party politics. The prime minister thought that he couldn't get it through the parliament and he decided to have a rabbit out of the hat, but it is something that may jeopardize things. BARNETT: I want to delve into that a bit more though, Michael, because you have said here that the main issue is the manner in which the Greek government has approached this crisis focusing much more on party politics and short term survival rather than what is truly best for the country financially long term, right? JACOBIDES: Absolutely. And I think you can see that in a number of different ways and the process of negotiation has created a lot of enemies of Greece. I mean, you know, simple things like showing up half an hour late in the crucial Euro group where things are being discussed, small details that show that there is a combination of ignorance and arrogance. Remember, we have a government of activists, people who have not had government experience and I think that if you look at what's going on, this is both what has caused the problems and what may be the greatest cause of concern even if they wanted to get out of the euro, there should have been a plan ""b,"" a preparation for what will follow. As we can see plainly today, that was not in place. The biggest concern is what will follow if things do not manage to stick together and what's going to be interesting is the result of the referendum. If the Greek population ends up voting yes and someone suggests that there may be more yes votes than no votes, then obviously the government will have to change in some shape or form. And the entire structure right now, the way these negotiations happen, but also the outcome suggests that we are going to have a very dramatic week. BARNETT: Certainly.

That was Eliot Spitzer's 2007 state of the state address, talking about the danger of losing confidence in elected officials. Even those who say prostitution is not a big deal point to the hypocrisy in these allegations, if true, a man who prosecuted and railed against -- against prostitution himself, himself allegedly frequenting a prostitution ring. Erica Hill is here with more. Erica, what a day. ERICA HILL, HEADLINE NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And, Anderson, that really seemed to be what was bothering people so much today was that hypocrisy, this man who had gone after prostitution rings possibly now being linked to one as well, allegedly, because that is how he made a name for himself. Tonight, though, as we mentioned, he is linked possibly to a prostitution ring. And that scandal, as many before have learned, could put an end to his political dreams.

For a lot of parents, though, it's not enough, some parents saying that they can't work. We talked to one mother yesterday who had a job interview.

They have stressed time and time again that they've tried to avoid them, but they knew that it would be inevitable. Whenever you engage in air strikes against a society -- cities there, of course, will be casualties like we're seeing now. But also for that group of journalists on that media tour outside that village they were confronted by a fairly angry mob who were chanting anti-U.S. slogans. And they were also chanting Osama bin Laden's name; and Stephen, they were calling him a hero. FRAZIER: John, we're looking at pictures of that demonstration as you talk to us. I'd like to take you back and ask you, if you would, to analyze these green nightscope pictures. I'm not sure you're seeing, live, what we are. But just in general the picture we're looking at that's live has a very bright glow in the center of screen when we get to the nightscope. And I would presume -- and help me here, John -- that that means that there's something burning, and burning rather brightly and largely. I don't think there are any lights on during the evening there, are there? VAUSE: No, what's been happening is that when these air strikes happen the Taliban have been cutting power to the city, plunging the city into darkness, trying to make it harder for the pilots to find their targets. But yes, when you see that bright glowing on the horizon, yes, that's usually an indication of something burning or some kind of missile, or possibly even antiaircraft tracer fire going up into the distance. But I can't see that just at the moment. But I understand that what you're talking about is a fairly bright glow on the horizon. What they have been trying to hit is military targets. They could have hit an ammunition dump. In the past we know that they have hit fuel depots as well. It's very difficult to read these pictures; you can make all sorts of assumptions. But until you can actually get there on the ground, like we have people on the ground who go out and try and find out just what's been hit. It's very difficult to try and read into these pictures just what's happening, apart from making generalizations; apart from the fact that an air strike is underway and that something, as you say, is burning, and something's been hit.

It was health, really health related that made me decide to focus on it, because, prior to that, I have to tell you, I was the happiest fat person I've ever met and probably the happiest fat person in relationship to skinny people. I had a great life. I didn't do it because I wanted a better quality of life, really. I did it for my health and for my son. And it's been lovely being able to shop at different stores I never knew before. But I did it for health reasons and for him. CHUNG: May I ask you how you did it? MANHEIM: Well, it was -- I can't -- I don't really have a plan. I've been playing a lot of racquetball. In fact, I just had knee surgery 10 days ago because I exercised my way right to surgery. But I did. I exercised a lot. And I cut out a few things. But I didn't really follow a major plan. It worked for me. And once I got regulated with medication for thyroid, it really helped. So, it was just a combination of a bunch of stuff. I wanted a new beginning. I started exercising. And it just kind of happened. I'm not out there advocating weight loss... CHUNG: Right. Right. MANHEIM: ... or telling people the kind of diet that I did, because it's important to me that people find their own way. And I don't want to be the spokesperson for any one way, you know what I mean?

That's not anti anything. That is the truth. I think it is tough. Especially if you're saying we don't want police defunded. Which I go back to most people don't.

Some 12,000 lightning strikes over the past several days resulting in hundreds of wildfires. Two dozen of them considered major. Those fires have been broken into various complexes. There are three of them. And two of the three are considered two of the largest wildfires in California history. The good news, as far as this fire is concerned, where we are, this is the LNU Complex Fire. Containment is now above 20 percent. Crews made great progress over the weekend.

MOORE: Members of Congress, this is Michael Moore. TOM O'NEIL, ""IN-TOUCH WEEKLY"": People don't like to pay money to see something about politics. And they don't pay money to see documentaries. So the success of this movie is all the more remarkable because of that. VARGAS: The film's distributor says Michael Moore's scathing documentary about President Bush brought in more money in its opening weekend than any other documentary ever. From big cities to small towns the film has become a magnet for the anti-Bush crowd. Though some conservatives have been reluctant to address the issue, counter efforts have been waged. Organizations hoping to discredit Moore claim he manipulates facts and stretches artistic license. One group Citizens United has filed a claim with the Federal Election Commission charging the film's TV ads violate campaign laws. DAVID BOSSIE, CITIZENS UNITED: The movie which I have seen is full, start to finish with lies. It's propaganda. VARGAS: The filmmaker welcomes the criticism.

In other words, put the pieces together for me. WOLK: All right. The airplane is flying in thunderstorms. It's turbulent. Icing conditions exist as they do in the tops of thunderstorms. The pilot is deviating to get around the worst of it. He now tries to climb to get above as much of the clouds, and therefore turbulence that he possibly can. Icing conditions occur.

That is what the Lebanese government says it needs most. And the Lebanese government will not get that from the United States. COOPER: Christiane Amanpour, what about Syria's role in all of this? The U.S. not meeting directly with Syria. Yet they clearly must play a part. They're the major funder of Hezbollah. AMANPOUR: Yes, well today Prime Minister Olmert basically said and was very dismissive, as one could imagine, about Syria, saying that Syria has not played at all a constructive role, and intimating that Syria was not part of the solution. But really, behind closed doors, they all tell us that Syria should be part of the solution. The big question is how to get it part of the solution. Most people believe that Syria is only really going to talk and take notice of somebody as powerful as the secretary of state of the United States, or the president, and that getting others to try to do that work for them is going to be less effective. On the other hand as well, as well as trying to get Syria to pressure Hezbollah to do what they want to do, the international forces envision to also patrol the Lebanon-Syria border, to prevent any kind of future infiltration of weapons or the like. COOPER: John Roberts, what is the likelihood the U.S. can sort of try to wean Syria away from Iran, get Syria to make a break with Hezbollah? ROBERTS: It depends on how much pressure it can get other Arab states in the region to put on Syria. It's really counting on Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, that triumvirate, to be able to put pressure on Bashar al-Assad, to get him to wedge himself away or they're trying to actually put the wedge in between Syria and Iran. They're saying to Bashar Assad, what kind of state do you want Syria to be? What kind of player do you want it to be in the region? Do you really want to be in bed with Iran or do you want to be a community of Arab nations? Don't forget, there is a historic split between Iran and the rest of the Arab world because the background of Iran is Persian, not Arab. So they're trying to put this pressure on Assad to say, we want you to be a part of the Arab world, and if you want to be a part of the Arab world, you have to play nice and you have to put pressure on Hezbollah to put down its arms and you have to help Lebanon maintain a stable democracy.

I'm guessing the president's name is at close to the top. Dana Bash appreciate your reporting and insights. Let's move on now to some important news, CNN reporting on what the president calls his coronavirus cure. It is no cure, but the antibody cocktail from a drug company called Regeneron was part of the president's aggressive coronavirus treatment. And he now promises all Americans will be able to get it free and soon. Experts though have a very different take. They warn there may only be limited access to this treatment and it likely will carry a steep price tag. CNN's Sara Murray has been doing this reporting. She is here to explain. Sarah? SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, ever since the president got Regeneron's the antibody cocktail, he can't stop talking about it. I mean let's just take a look at him last night talking about it yet again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: When I got it, I had a choice. Do nothing or use some of the things that we're looking at, like in this case, Regeneron. and Eli Lilly makes something that's supposed to be incredible. And I think that maybe I wouldn't be doing this discussion with you right now. We have therapies now and cures, maybe you can use the word cure. (END VIDEO CLIP) MURRAY: Now, he calls it a cure. He says every American is going to be able to get it. That is just not the case, John. Every American is not going to be able to get this kind of treatment. First of all, it's still experimental, it's promising, but it is not yesterday proven, the FDA has not issued an authorization yet, and if or when they do, it could be for a relatively small subset of coronavirus patients. If they did decide to issue a broader authorization for a lot of people to be able to access this treatment, it's not likely that the companies that make these kinds of treatments would be able to make enough to go around. They would have had to -- the Trump administration start ramping up manufacturing on these months and months ago and there was pressure from scientists inside and outside the administration to get them to do that. But within the Trump administration they were really focused on this pursuit of vaccines. And they knew that vaccines would help with coronavirus. They weren't sure if these antibody therapies would pan out and if the science would be there. The other issue, John, is the price. The government bought up a number of these doses in the hopes that they will work. And they are planning on providing them free of charge. But people are worried about what happens when these are commercially available and how expensive they could be and they're very worried",0.4784364773366756,2020-10-16

And speaking of that, there's been a bit of a dust up out on the campaign trail the last couple of days and it also started late Friday when two of Barack Obama's superdelegate supporters, Pat Leahy from Vermont and Chris Dodd from Connecticut both suggested that it was time for Hillary Clinton to get out of the race that mathematically was going to be difficult for her to get the number of delegates needed to secure the nomination and saying well, Barack Obama is in front, Senator Clinton, it's time for you to bow out. Well, Senator Clinton said thanks but no thanks. She responded to that call coming from Leahy and Dodd yesterday out on the campaign trail.

If you'd like your very own flying car, Terrafugia is taking orders now. So, you apparently just need $10,000 deposit, which is something you would have if you had just won the Mega Millions lottery. Speaking of which, OUTFRONT next, why that lottery might end up. It's money outside America. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BURNETT: So back to the lottery. We saw this on the Mega Millions Web site today. Quote, ""Non-U.S. citizens can legally play, and non-U.S. citizens are eligible to win any prize offered in the game."" That's right. Non Americans can play and win Mega Millions. I didn't know that. So, you know, if you're here on vacation from Beijing or Paris, you might take home 640 million bucks. And that brings us to tonight's number: 22.4 million. That's how much more of this mostly American funded jackpot that a Canadian would take home than an American. Yes. So, here's how it breaks down. Tonight's lottery has a $640 million jackpot. If you take it as a lump sum, you get $462 million. So, Mega Millions withholds taxes, 25 percent for U.S. residents, 30 percent for foreigners, i.e., Canadians. That leaves us with $346 million for an American and $326 million for a Canadian. But it doesn't end there for you, Americans. Why? Well, because those millions comes the 5 percent federal tax rate. Gambling winnings, even the lottery are taxed as income. And since Mega Millions only withheld 25 percent, Uncle Same will take the other 10 percent when you file. That will knock your jackpot down to $301 million. But Canadians don't have to pay it. They literally walk out of the country with $22 million extra dollars -- something to think about the next time you see a guy in a hockey jersey standing in the lottery line.

Things got back up and running around 3:30 Eastern and the Nasdaq finished up 38 points. Market officials say the problem was with a security system. They're not getting too specific. The market is so automated now that one hiccup can crash everything. The last time Wall Street experienced technical difficulties like this was last year during Facebook's bumpy IPO, remember that? Yesterday on the show, we referred to Google as our overlords. But is this really becoming the age of Yahoo!? New figures show that Yahoo's web site had more U.S. web traffic than Google last month. That hasn't happened in over two years. Now there are reports that Yahoo! is in talks to pair up with Four Square. You know, that app where you share where you're eating or hanging out because all your friends are dying to know where you are every waking moment. This all happened under the leadership of CEO Marissa Meyer, shown here in a photo shoot with ""Vogue"" magazine. She took over the reigns just last year. So is Meyer bringing Yahoo to the top of the herd? Let's bring in Jessi Hempel, she is senior writer for ""Fortune"" magazine. Jesse, thanks for being here. How big a deal is this claim of Yahoo! having more traffic here in the U.S.? JESSI HEMPEL, SENIOR TECH WRITER, ""FORTUNE"" MAGAZINE: Well, it's certainly a big deal, particularly for Yahoo! because you'll remember when Marissa took over the job as CEO about a year and a month ago, Yahoo! was nowhere. It had really been lost. Jake, it's important to talk about what this is not, in order to understand it. These figures suggest that Yahoo! had a really good month in July and that it was more popular than Google on desktops in the United States. Now, we know that increasingly people are surfing the web from their mobile devices and surfing the wood all over the world. Google, if you use the word overlord, it's safe a word to use when you're thinking about the broader context here. TAPPER: So they're picking and choosing. HEMPEL: It's a big deal, Jake. I don't want to suggest that it's not. Because it suggests that Yahoo! is coming back and I think anybody who signed up for a Yahoo! e-mail account back in 2002 and then wondered for the last ten years why Yahoo! started getting worse and worse and worse is excited to see maybe the Yahoo! experience might be coming back.

1170499,1475978,CNN,CNN's Amanpour,"CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN HOST: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the program. I'm Christiane Amanpour. Ten years ago today Baghdad fell, just three weeks after the U.S. invaded Iraq. And the world watched as jubilant Iraqis and U.S. Marines tore down a giant bronze statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad. The image was played over and over again all over the world. In the United States, it was taken as a sign of victory along with the pictures of Iraqis celebrating. But then as now 10 years later, the toppling of Saddam's statue remains the perfect metaphor: perception did not match reality. A war the United States thought it had easily won instead dragged on for another decade, killing thousands of American forces and over 100,000 Iraqi civilians. And after all the mistakes, all the death and destruction, today the majority of Iraqis say they don't even think democracy can work. The American people thought it would be a quick and clean war because that's what their leaders told them. And those leaders were citing assurances from prominent Iraqi exiles to back up their case. One of those exiles is my guest tonight, Kanan Makiya. Former Vice President Dick Cheney cited Makiya just days before the invasion. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DICK CHENEY, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators. I've talked with a lot of Iraqis in the last several months myself, had them to the White House, men like Kanan Makiya, who's a professor at Brandeis, but an Iraqi. He's written great books about the subject, knows the country intimately, is a part of the democratic opposition and resistance. (END AUDIO CLIP) AMANPOUR: Everybody remembers Cheney saying that U.S. troops will be greeted with sweets and flowers. Now Kanan Makiya, who said that, is an expatriot Iraqi who was educated at MIT. He laid the groundwork for the invasion with his extensive work on Saddam's brutality. His books, like ""Republic of Fear,"" became the neocon Bible. Ten years later, Makiya believes Iraqis are indeed better off without that brutal dictator. But he does now admit to many errors of judgment about just how the war would turn out, as you'll hear in our conversation in a moment. But first, a look at the other stories we're covering tonight.

So, Ed, retailers, employees all over the country have taken some of the biggest hits, obviously, during the pandemic. What are the precautions stores in Texas are taking to make sure that everybody can be safe? ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the rule -- this is essentially working under the premise of retail-to-go. So that (ph) retail stores can open up, but can be curbside pick-up only, customers can't come inside stores. We're outside of Good Records record store, a vinyl shop here, a funky little gem in East Dallas. And this is part of a storefront of areas that have been opened up. We have the owner of this store, Chris Penn, who has been here and he's started doing this. You can see how he is greeting his customers, who are pulling up here. He has gloves, the face mask on. Chris, do you welcome this opening or are you nervous that it could cause more harm than good? CHRIS PENN, OWNER, GOOD RECORDS: Well, I'm approaching it with trepidation, but we're being extremely vigilant and cautious. And it's just me, it's a one-man show. Not having any of my employees show up yet, and putting it in the backseat or the trunk, and we're going to get boxes where we put the stuff outside and we go back in, and we won't have any contact with the customer at all.

KAYE: In fact, a recent poll by the National Sleep Foundation found one-third of all Americans are losing sleep over the state of the economy and their personal finances. That means more prescriptions for sleeping pills. One health care company that tracks this stuff says doctors wrote more than 56 million prescriptions last year, a seven percent increase from the year before.

HOWELL: You point out that Sean Spicer says that this is a fact that the president was pointing out on Twitter. But again, looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it might be a duck. I think we're calling it a veiled threat here on CNN for the least. Mr. Trump indicates that there may have been recording devices also present during the conversation with Comey; neither the president nor his press secretary, though, would confirm or deny whether recording devices are there. What are the implications if they are there? BORRELLI: Well, I mean, the fact that they wouldn't confirm or deny is already quite telling in itself. We know both Trump and Spicer have always very forcefully rebuked any statement that they thought was inaccurate. So the fact that they're being a bit vague about it now hints at the fact that there might have been some recordings. At the same time, you know, in the States, it varies from state to state whether it's legal or not to record conversations without people present all being aware of it. In D.C., it's perfectly legal if Donald Trump was aware of it. So it's not illegal for the president to have tapped anyone at the White House. But at the same time, the result is just going to be that there's going to be mounting pressure on the White House to produce these recordings if they exist. Some Democrats have already asked the president to bring these recordings forward if they exist. And we know, I believe it was a BuzzFeed report from 2016 that Trump has a bit of a habit of recording people and he did record his staff in Mar-a-lago during the presidential campaign last year. So you know, he just has a different way of doing things. And this is another, you know, fact that points to the fact that he does things in a different way and people are going to want to know about what these recordings say and if they actually exist.

You point out, you know, that he does things in a different way and that is one of the main reasons -- HOWELL: -- many people who supported Mr. Trump continue to support him looking for, you know, change in Washington that they expect him to usher in. I want to also talk about the press and an issue that's come up just this week. So in the United Kingdom, as here in the United States, there is a tradition of the press, you know, asking questions, continuing to probe and get at information for the people that we serve. But there's this question, the president suggested that he might scrap press briefings altogether, basically saying that, you know, his surrogates aren't able to quite keep up",0.0738742199243547,2017-05-13

SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Not that I know of. CUOMO: He wouldn't answer that question. SANDERS: Right, and I just don't know the answer. I don't know of anyone that he did and I haven't had a chance -- CUOMO: He has worked with the White House before when it comes to intelligence and the Russia investigation. SANDERS: Look, we have certainly coordinated with members of Congress as is appropriate. As to specifics on this, I just don't know the answer. I'm not aware of any conversations or coordination with Congressman Nunes. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: In a moment, two of the chairman's House colleagues join us, a Republican and a Democrat. But, first, CNN's Jeff Zeleny at the White House with the very latest. Jeff, so just to be clear, the president has been telling his associates, what, this memo is going to discredit the Russia investigation? JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Anderson, we did learn that today, talking with some friends and associates of the president. They said in recent days, in telephone calls, he's been calling around particularly after the State of the Union Address to see how it went, that he believes the release of this memo will indeed discredit and confuse if you will the Russia investigation, simply by exposing bias in his view in the FBI. So, that is something the president has been openly saying as the White House has been trying to show that, you know, they're doing due diligence here and going over this 3 1/2 page memo. You know, the reality is, the lawyers have been reviewing it, aides have been reviewing it, the president himself read this memo himself yesterday, we are told earlier today. But the reality is, the president was always planning to review it and release it. So, the point here is he has been talking about how he believes this will discredit the investigation was simply refuted by Speaker Paul Ryan today when he told reporters in West Virginia this should not impugn the Russia investigation. So, they are at odds with each other. Of course, he does support the release of this. But certainly interesting that the president already getting ahead of this, believing this will discredit and muddle, if you will, this investigation. COOPER: I mean, despite the fact the White House has said they'll be redacting parts of the memo, I understand the FBI today still pushing back on the release. ZELENY: They are indeed. And, you know, throughout the day, we heard they were redacting it. A senior administration official said this evening they would not likely redacting much of it. They",0.0784944841012329,2018-02-01

CHRISTINE KWAPNOSKI, PLAINTIFF: The first time I saw that ad I had to laugh. ROGERS: An 18 year veteran of the world's largest retailer, Kwapnoski alleges Wal-Mart is not an ideal work place for women. KWAPNOSKI: I've been promoted over several times, ended up training the male counterparts that were being promoted over me. ROGERS: Kwapnoski, who is suing Wal-Mart along with six other women, alleges the company discriminates against women when it comes to pay, promotion and training. That lawsuit became the largest civil rights class action case ever, according to the women's attorney, who says size matters when you're fighting Wal-Mart. BRAD SELIGMAN, LEAD PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY: It's the largest case anyone has brought against Wal-Mart. They've never faced a national class action; they've always faced local, smaller cases. This is the first time that the entire company, coast to coast, is on the line. And that really does make a difference. ROGERS: The class certified by a federal judge in San Francisco, covers every female employee who works or worked at a Wal-Mart-owned store in the United States since late 1998. That's over 1.5 million women. Wal-Mart denies it discriminates against women and says it has announced a new job classification and pay structure for hourly associates. Which is designed to ensure internal equity and external competitiveness. (on camera): Wal-Mart is also quick to point out that Tuesday's order is not a ruling on the merits of the case, but a decision that the suit meets the legal requirements to move forward under class action status. (voice-over): Wal-Mart fought class action certification in court last fall, arguing its 3,200 stores are autonomous, acting as individual businesses, with most decisions regarding pay and promotion made at the local level. After a speech in Washington Tuesday, Wal- Mart chairman Rob Walton said the class certification is cause for concern. ROB WALTON, CHAIRMAN, WAL-MART: We believe that it is wrong and the judge has made a mistake. ROGERS: The company says it will appeal Tuesday's decision. No trial date has been set. Plaintiffs' attorneys say they will have no problem locating the million-plus women now part of this class, saying Wal-Mart keeps the best employment records of any company in the United States.

This country is being ripped apart here. We've got to make sure that we do due diligence. I think this committee has done a good job but I do think that we can have a short pause and make sure that the FBI can investigate. My understanding is that some of us would have to and I'm prepared to do it, make a request to the White House to ask the FBI to do that investigation. It would be short and limited in scope to the current allegations that have been made. But I would just encourage the Democrats who we talked to before to endorse that kind of thing, that we can then move on. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Chairman. SEN.

Here's Moore tonight, defiant on Sean Hannity's radio show. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) ROY MOORE (R), ALABAMA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: These allegations are completely false and misleading. But more than anything, it hurts me personally because, you know, I'm a father, I have one daughter. I have five granddaughters. And I have a special concern for protection of young ladies. This is, this is really hard to get on radio and explain this. I don't know her from anybody. I've never talked to her, never had any contact with her. Allegations of sexual misconduct with her are completely false. I believe they're politically motivated. I believe they're brought only to stop a very successful campaign and that's what they're doing. I have never known this woman or anything with regard to the other girls, and I understand this is 40 years ago, after my return from the military, I dated a lot of young ladies. (END AUDIO CLIP) BOLDUAN: Remember what the woman at the center of the Post story has said. Leigh Corfman told the Post that in 1979 when she was 14 years old, Moore met her at a courthouse where her mother was attending a child custody hearing. Moore, according to Corfman offered to stay with her while her mother went inside for the hearing. Corfman says Moore asked for her number and days later, picked her up, took her to his home and kissed her. During a second visit, she says, he took off her shirt and pants, removed his clothes, touching her and guiding her to touch him. She was 14. In addition, three more women told the Post that Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18, although they do not accuse him of anything inappropriate. The legal age of consent in Alabama then and now is 16. So along with those four women, the Post basis reporting on interviews with more than 30 people who say they knew Moore between 1977 and 1982.

There is a sense that the sniper is watching TV and paying attention to what people are concerned about, and there is the potential, several officers have told me, several detectives, that he could try and hit where we're standing at police headquarters. And they've put up security fences around here and so forth, in an effort to kind of keep people safe. KAGAN: Well, before people get too concerned about that, and I think my mom's watching...

The missing explosives have become a major issue in the presidential campaign just a week before the election. But there are many unanswered questions tonight about what happened to those explosives, the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in all of this and the way in which news organizations reported the story.

JAMIE MCINTYRE, CNN SENIOR PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, as you said, Lou, there are real questions tonight about whether U.S. troops in Iraq knew about the weapons stockpile and did everything possible to secure them, or were the weapons -- the explosives, that is, possibly moved by Saddam Hussein? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCINTYRE (voice-over): The Pentagon acknowledges there was a window of about six weeks after the invasion of Iraq when it's possible the stockpile of high explosives could have been stolen from the sprawling al Qa Qaa facility south of Baghdad. But Pentagon officials argue it's more likely the explosives were moved as part of the prewar dispersal ordered by Saddam Hussein.

Prices pumped. U.S. inflation rises at the fastest pace in 13 years. Volkswagen volts. The carmaker goes all in on electric and autonomous mobility. And Musk misery. He tells a court he rather hates being Tesla's CEO. It's Tuesday. Let's make a move. Welcome to FIRST MOVE. We have got another jam-packed show for you this Tuesday. Earnings season in the United States has begun and surprise or no surprise, banks are earning a lot. Consumer prices come in extremely hot, and as I said there, Elon Musk says being CEO of Tesla, well, he'd rather not. Yes, Musk said that during a court appearance on Monday that he actually hates running the electric vehicle company, perhaps he thinks it's boring, See, what I did there, boring company. Yes. Moving on, nothing boring about today start to earnings season. JPMorgan's Q2 earnings saw 150 percent year-over-year. The big bank buzz, the release of $3 billion set aside for bad loans. Goldman Sachs, its profits powering ahead, too, thanks to fees from deal making and listings. Company's IPO- ing, not our only focus though. Today, U.S. consumer price data showing a much greater than expected 5.4 percent year-over-year rise last month. The comparison, of course, with what was going on this time last year important, but it is the highest levels since 2008. So, it's a day of rising profits and rising prices, but is it a day of rising stocks? Not after that numbers and real caution feeding into the markets. The Dow easing back from that 35,000 mark. What about Europe, too? Well, as you can see easing back from records, too. Though Asia had a strong session. China saw an expectation beating 32 percent rise in June exports easing some of those broader slowdown fears. China also said -- and this is crucial -- supply bottlenecks are easing, though I have to say, there are other signals from the region suggesting entirely the opposite. We're also watching the U.S. administration today, President Biden is set to warn U.S. companies about operating in Hong Kong due to China's growing influence. That, according to various reports. The White House also reportedly mulling a multi-nation digital trade deal, though excluding China. If we get this news, it's going to be seen as lines in the sand being drawn I have to say. All right, let's get to the drivers. Much to discuss. U.S. consumer prices taking a jarring June jump, sure to test the patience of Fed Chair, Jay Powell. We also, as I mentioned, have bank earnings in focus. Paul La Monica joins me now. Paul, let's talk about that U.S. inflation data. I mentioned it and it is important, the comparison with the year ago's numbers is important given what was going on.

He is the chief spokesman for the Miami Metrozoo. Ron, what do you think went wrong in San Francisco, if you can answer that? RON MAGILL, MIAMI METROZOO: Gosh, Don, I really don't know. I wasn't there. I'm not terribly familiar with the exhibit. Obviously, something did go wrong. And zoos around the country are really waiting the outcome of this investigation to see what the outcome is, to see whether in fact the tiger escaped, what was the reason for the escape, if there was any help in the escape. There's so much speculation right now that we really can't comment on it. We have got to wait until the end of that investigation. LEMON: OK. Here's the thing everyone is trying. And I had Dave Salmoni, who works for one of the animal shows. I think it's Animal Planet, if I'm correct here. And he was talking about a tiger is so long, and it can get up really high. And then maybe about 10 feet high, it's now out of the question. And then once it's up that high, it can jump and it gets to the top of the wall and it can lift itself up over that wall. Is that feasible? It seems, to the ordinary person or to the person who is not an expert, like, this is a stretch. MAGILL: Well, I got to be honest with you. Again, I don't know what the exhibit looks like. I don't know the parameters. To say a tiger from a flat, solid ground could get up to a 20- foot level, I don't think it's impossible. This is the most powerful cat on the face of this planet. I just got back from India, and I was tracking tigers in the wild. And I watched them hunt and I watched them jumped and I watched them their power. So, I would not think that going up 20 feet is something totally impossible for a cat to reach. But you have got to keep in mind that people -- these exhibits -- the San Francisco Zoo is an accredited zoo. It's an outstanding zoo. For them to be accredited, they had to surpass every local, state and federal regulation in all of their exhibit barriers. So, they have done an outstanding job in doing that. That's why this investigation is so important, because has this tiger in fact redefined the limitations of tigers as we know it? Because for years we have never had a tiger do something like that. LEMON: Right. MAGILL: So, that's why this investigation is so important. LEMON: And maybe they have gotten used to being in captivity and they are starting to learn things and just evolving more about being in captivity.

CNN has just returned from the rare behind the lines trip to war-torn Yemen in the last few days and situation in the City of Aden has worsened with one time allies in the fight against the Houthi rebels now turning their fire it seems on each other. International diplomatic editor Nic Robertson explains. (BEGIN VIDEO) NIC ROBERTSON, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yemen's civil war pits the internationally recognized government of President Hadi and the Saudi led coalition backing it against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The Houthis control the capital Sanaa while Hadi government has established in Yemen's second city, Aden in the south, although the President, himself, lives in, Saudi Arabia. Yemen has become a proxy war between the Saudi coalition and Iran. Hadi's government comprises many different factions including the powerful Isla Party or the Muslim brotherhood, and the Southern separatists. The separatists themselves are divided into two main groups and unified wanting an independent southern state. The north and south of Yemen were only unified in 1990 and in the past four decades the north and south had fought three civil wars. The southern separatists or hara accuse Hadi's prime minister of being corrupt and attempted to over throw him in the recent few days. Further complicating the civil war, Hadi's government also fighting al-Qaeda and ISIS with U.S. and coalition support. Layered in to all of this a tribal interest and powerful regional governors and political parties plummet up and made more powerful by support from Saudi and the UAE. However as the UAE and Saudi Arabia appear despite their denials to ISSA: agree on some key issues, for example the influence and the future government of the Muslim brotherhood headed by Saudi Arabia getting a political deal everyone, government, the separatist, and all of the of coalition partners can sign up to is proving elusive.

This has hit a raw nerve in me. I can only imagine how it has reopened the wounds of the women who came forward with their stories about him and did not receive enough attention."" Billy Bush there. Of course he was on that tape as well. Well, now to the North Korean nuclear crisis. And for the first time, the U.S. is sending some of its newest stealth fighter jets to join aerial drills with South Korea. As expected, North Korea is condemning the annual exercises as a dangerous provocation. Less than a week ago, Pyongyang tested what it claims to be its most advanced ballistic missile. And CNN's Paula Hancocks joins us now live from Seoul in South Korea with more on this. So Paula, do these joint air drills signal any move towards some level of war footing on the part of the U.S., given White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster insists the U.S. and North Korea are close to war? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, what we're hearing officially from U.S. forces Korea, they released a statement just a few hours ago saying that this happens every year. It is an annual drill. It is a comparable size to previous years. It's some 230 aircraft, 12,000 personnel. So it's a significant drill. But they also say it's not in response to any incident or provocation. That being said, they got off and say this when it comes to these annual drills. But they do insist it is annual. But the fact that you have these F-22 raptors, the stealth fighters, the top of the line stealth fighters coming to the Korean Peninsula, they arrived here over the weekend. They're carrying out these military drills above the Korean Peninsula and around it right now. So, that of course, is going to strike a nerve when it comes to North Korea. These are the kinds of fighter jets according to experts that would likely lead any kind of military action against North Korea. It's the kind of fighter jets, stealth fighter that if it goes into North Korea, if it degenerates to that point where there is a military conflict, then North Korea wouldn't know it about it until that target has been hit. So certainly have a concern to North Korea. They have specified in statements over the weekend and also from the foreign ministry saying that Trump is clearly is begging for a nuclear war, saying it's an open all out provocation which may lead to a nuclear war at any moment. So we're hearing increased concerns from both sides certainly that this is closer to war. But certainly from the U.S.'s point of view, this was planned",0.0414301784527279,2017-12-04

I'm Isa Soares, and you are watching CNN NEWSROOM. A nightmare is intensifying, unfortunately, in Aleppo in Syria. More intense air strikes are hitting the besieged city on Saturday. Activists say the bombing there is the heaviest as ever been. Medical volunteers tell CNN approximately 200 air strikes, 200 have hit the city since Friday morning. They estimate more than 100 people are dead and hundreds more are wounded. Rescue teams are working to save those buried beneath the rubble. The ceasefire has collapsed, as you can tell, and the Syrian government has launched new military operations. We're about to show you a disturbing picture from Aleppo. We think it shows the cruel reality of the war. It is a story that must be told. After a horrendous air strike, this is what rescuers found in a destroyed apartment.

How ferocious have they been and talk to us a bit more the impact that it's had that on the people at the heart of this very conflict. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the activists in Aleppo, eastern Aleppo, which is controlled by the opposition, we've spoken to this morning say these are the worst air strikes that they have ever seen since the outbreak of the uprising against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in March of 2011. And now in addition to the air strikes of course, you now have this additional crisis of there's no more water, there's no running water in the city. The pumping station that supplies the eastern opposition-controlled part was hit. And as a result, that part of the city is without water. And in revenge, the opposition turned out off another pumping station that they control that provides water to the other regime-controlled part of the city. So according to UNICEF, 2 million people in and around Aleppo are now without water.

They don't mention that, because it was so good. The only time they mentioned it was when Adam Schiff made it up. You talk about Pinocchios, that should get 10 Pinocchios.

But I can guarantee you that no walk-in ever provided information that actually led us to Osama bin Laden. The way we got to him was by following the courier, from Peshawar, to Abbottabad, finding his residence and watching that residence over a period of months. That's how we found him. Not from somebody walking in and certainly not from a Pakistani official telling us and us paying him $25 million. TAPPER: All right.

The Vatican says the policy of celibacy itself was never up for discussion today, but, rather, it wanted to consider the implications of ""disobedience."" Zambian archbishop Emmanuel Milingo was excommunicated in September when he ordained four married men as bishops. But he's continuing his campaign to change Vatican policy -- Michael. HOLMES: All right. Let's get a little bit more now on this controversy from Delia Gallagher, who's covered the Vatican for many years. She joins us from New York. Good to see you, Delia. Tell me this: the end result of this meeting, just sum it up for us. What actually came out of it? DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN FAITH AND VALUES CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think this is very interesting, Michael, because a lot of people were wondering, what is this meeting all about? Because nobody expected Pope Benedict to actually come out and change any of the rules on celibacy. And so I think what you have here -- this was a three-hour closed-door meeting and a very short statement from the Vatican afterwards which Hala just read, sort of saying, we -- we reaffirm our commitment to the fact of priestly celibacy and to the formation of seminarians and priests in that tradition. So, I think that this is Pope Benedict sort of stopping -- nipping problems in the bud, as it were, because you have Archbishop Milingo, who has been going on for some years now, you have -- now he's in charge of a movement of married priests and so on. And I think this is the pope coming very quickly on to these topics when they are raised and trying to get to his advisers and say, let's deal with this immediately. We all know what the teaching is, but let's reaffirm it. It seems to me that's what's happening here at the Vatican. HOLMES: Talk to me about the relevancy and how it's seen at the Vatican, of course, of celibacy for priests in the modern age. Why it is so important in the Church? GALLAGHER: Well, I think this is one of those issues where the Catholic Church meets the modern world and they can't see eye to eye. One doesn't understand the other. And, of course, it's a long tradition in the Catholic Church. The pope has said himself when he was cardinal that it's one of those questions that should be looked at from time to time, but that the uncoupling of the two -- i.e. celibacy and priesthood -- doesn't represent -- there might be more to lose than to gain from it because it's part of",0.3311103100216294,2006-11-16

SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, Governor Rick Perry certainly made some interesting comments off-camera with reporters at the tax protest party in Austin yesterday, suggesting that the Lone Star State may eventually want to go it alone. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOV. RICK PERRY (R), TEXAS: Texas is a unique place. When we came into the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that. There is absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the -- at the American people, you know, who knows what may came may came -- or may come out of that? HAYES (voice-over): The governor's words, according to University of Texas law professor, Sanford Levinson, amounts to nothing more than bravado. SANFORD LEVINSON, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, GOVERNMENT AND LAW PROFESSOR: The notion that this could actually be a live issue, he can't be serious. The people around him can't be serious. The people around him can't be serious. It's, you know, the cheapest sort of demagoguery. HAYES: Texas is known for asserting its independence and size. The Texas Capitol Building is second only to the U.S. Capitol and almost 15 feet higher. On the state grounds, there are three statues of confederate soldiers. And there's even a movement of sorts that claims the state is not part of the union. And, of course, there's that Texas swagger. But reporter Jason Embry with the ""Austin-American Statesman"" says when it comes to the governor's comments, consider the politics. JASON EMBRY, ""AUSTIN-AMERICAN STATESMAN"": Governor Perry has a very serious re-election challenge facing him in less than a year in the form of United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is going to run against him in the Republican primary for governor. (END VIDEO TAPE) HAYES: And Senator Hutchison's office and the office of former President George W. Bush declined to comment on this issue. But Texas Democrats are calling on Perry to disavow any talk about withdrawing from the United States -- Wolf. BLITZER: Did you check with his office? Was he really serious? Did he just mean what he was saying? Was it just a little bravado? Did he issue a clarification today? Do we know -- Sam? HAYES: He didn't issue a clarification, Wolf, but I did check with his office. He wasn't available for an interview. But he never specifically he thinks this should happen or he wanted this to happen. He thinks very much that Texas should stay a part of the Union, but certainly kind of did give a nod to the opinions and feelings of some people in his state. BLITZER: Yes. Texas is not going anywhere. HAYES: Yes. BLITZER: It's part of the United States. All right. Thanks very much, Sam, for that. Let's move on and beyond Texas.

Also Obama's polls are coming down, it's a breathtaking decline. In fact one of which was the CNN poll. So, I don't think that has affinity to it, but I want to make another point too, this is community or not, the United States is nowhere close to defaulting on his treasury box. I just want to make that point as clear as I can. MORGAN: Tell me this on a ... KUDLOW: Not even close. MORGAN: ... on a technical point, though, answer this question, but let me just ... KUDLOW: I may not give you that numbers; I give you the number that has show you how far away you are. MORGAN: Let me clarify one point. Does a failure to deal with the debt ceiling on that particular day when it comes up, does that automatically calls America to default? KUDLOW: No, of course not. MORGAN: Then explain the difference. KUDLOW: Money, it's a constant flow process. Can I just -- on average, I mean can't give you each 30 days off the top of my head, on average USA takes in -- the government, they send about $240 billion, all right? That's a monthly average and the interesting expense we've paying our debt, is about $35 billion, $240 versus $35 it's not even close. Now, that's going to be the first priority is to keep our full faith and credit going just like any sensible country would. What President Obama has done here I think is very duplicitous he's been trying attacking the economy and saying, ""We're all going to go down the tube for his own political game."" There is no danger of a threat to our treasuries in and really that system awful trumped out, sorry. MORGAN: OK, Robert I can see you, you can maybe get in here. REICH: Well, you know, if I may disagree with my good friend Larry Kudlow. You have all my ... MORGAN: You may, sir. REICH: ... enormous respect, but you're absolutely wrong on this, Larry. First of all, there is a danger of default and the markets are beginning to inflect that danger, interest rates are beginning to spike and not only that but we have could seen that the stock market since mid-September when the Republican started to talk about a shutdown. The stock market also has lost ground but that was about 6 percent below what it was before and all of these things have some pressure on the Republican Party. Let me get to the second point you just raised. There is in fact, you are right that a default does not automatically triggered by October 17th that is Jack Lew and the treasury could prioritize increase payments on our debts,",0.1716600529100529,2013-10-09

Great to have you with us. Unfortunately, in California, right now, it is in flames. Six separate fires are still burning, nearly 300 square miles already scorched, 700 structures destroyed and now the first fire-related fatality, a 70-year-old woman has been found dead along an evacuation route near the Thomas fire in Ventura County. As the governor tours the devastation today and some families return home to find out what if anything is left, the high winds remain a major threat today. We will take you live to the fire lines in just minutes. But first to Alabama and last-minute push on right now for votes in the state's hotly contested Senate race with just three days left until the election, both campaigns are pulling out all the stops there. President Trump stumping for accused child molester, Roy Moore, last night giving him a full-throated endorsement at this rally in Pensacola, Florida. That's part of Mobile, Alabama TV market. And our CNN national correspondent, Alex Marquardt is there in Alabama, joins us from Montgomery. Alex, tell us about the president's message and the impact there in that state. ALEXANDER MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, there, Ana. Well, there had been some question as to what extent this rally just across the state line of Pensacola would actually be a Roy Moore rally. It was billed as a campaign style rally for the president, but it was clear that its secondary role was to reiterate his full-throated endorsement for Roy Moore. The Moore campaign had encouraged people from across the state, their supporters to go and attend this rally. I met a number of people from Alabama in attendance and the president certainly addressed and re-endorsed Moore there saying that he needed Moore in the Senate to advance his agenda. He called in to question the allegations of the number of women who have accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct. And he said that he needed Moore in the Senate to stop the Democrats from advancing their own agenda. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We can't afford to have a liberal Democrat who is completely controlled by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. We can't do it. His name is Jones and he is their total puppet, and everybody knows it. He will never ever vote for us. So, get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARQUARDT: So, to what extent will that actually change the dynamics in this race? Well, you have to understand that Roy Moore has been a known quantity for more 40 years.

And so what I did during my race was certainly not distance myself from President Obama. I said all along that I supported Obamacare. And I said all along that I supported a lot of initiatives that the current administration has. But I looked for places where I might agree with those folks who didn't agree with him. And education policy was one of them. NSA surveillance was another one. I certainly in my district was running against a very red electorate. And for Hillary Clinton, she's running in a Democratic primary. And you have got to appeal to the Democratic base and the people who vote in a primary, as I saw during my primary, which wasn't that easy myself.

So Iraq's political process this is the fifth election cycle in the country, always ends up with big political parties that have lot of money and the influence to be able to contest the elections, but they never can form a majority. So in the end, they sit together, they strike deals, they divvy out governmental positions, and they form a government that often is far from what people they want. Now they can - the politicians can turn around and say, but we are democratically elected, and therefore we have legitimacy from the street. So people want to take away that legitimacy and say, well, actually, no, you only represent a third of us. The rest of us don't agree with this political system, but don't want to bear arms. The protesters, Sam was eloquently speaking about and covered on the ground. The protesters' who went out to protest two years ago, wanted early elections, but not in a vacuum, having elections with the same sort of political makeup, while allowing militias to continue to bear arms and intimidate people while allowing corruption that funds these political parties doesn't solve much. So people didn't go out to vote to say, hang on, we called for early elections within a much greater context of reform, and a much greater context of political activism, that awards people for delivering - politicians for delivering services for the people, not simply having enough money, and at times guns to push their way through the ballot box.

This is, you know, this is a young generation, effectively voting, you know, this is the lowest turnout since the U.S. invasion in 2003. So this is - we're talking here, about the sort of end of U.S. occupation are a new generation who are quite frankly, protesting what is there? If that's the case, what's the fix at this point? AL-ORAIBI: The fix is a long one. One, you need constitutional change, and amendments, which are boring, but important that can fix some of the problems we have in the country. The next fix is for these political parties to realize that if this time, they're only getting a third of voters to actually come out and vote for them the next time, it could be even worse.

That's all in his pocket and the number one argument that he is going to make if it gets to a second ballot at the convention is Donald Trump isn't a real conservative.

The escalating restrictions come amid anger over a shocking child rape case that involves an Iraqi migrant. Earlier this week, Austrian police clashed with Italian protesters at a border crossing in the Alps. Hundreds marched in solidarity with the migrants and against Austria's decision to tighten borders. Today, the secretary general of the U.N., Ban Ki-Moon expressed his concerns about restrictive legislation saying, ""When the arrival process is well managed, accepting refugees is a win for everyone,"" unquote.

They say going into this latest exchange with Hamas, the Israeli military intelligence community believes Hamas had 10,000 rockets and missiles, a lot of them supplied from Iran. But they got some homemade stuff, as you know, as well. They believe about 1,600 as we speak right now, Michael, have been sent into Israel. The Iron Dome, as you pointed out, has destroyed many of them. Others landed in relatively open fields, farmland if you will. But they believe in the last few days, as this Israeli military operation has intensified on the ground, from the air and the sea. They destroyed another 3,500. So, they think there's about 5,000 leftover. They are trying to destroy as many as they can. They acknowledge by the time a cease- fire, if there is an end to this, they may not have completely destroyed Hamas' rocket and military capability, let alone its mortar shells and other kind of military hardware. So, they may not completely succeed this time either. SMERCONISH: How do you know when the mission is concluded? Is the IDF doing it by numbers that when they reach a certain level of taken out Hamas rockets, it is at that point they shut it down? BLITZER: What the IDF says is their mission is to destroy as much of Hamas military capability as possible. But specifically at least at this stage, to destroy their underground tunnels, tunnels they got from Gaza into Israel that can allow Hamas guys to come into Israel and kill people, if you will. So, they think they destroyed about 13 as of right now. But they think there are tens more. They won't be specific how many more. This is a very difficult operation. You can't destroy the tunnels from the air or sea. You got to put boots on the ground, as you will. Israel has mobilized about 50,000 reservists and thousands of Israeli troops are now engaged in this operation. They say the mission is to destroy those tunnels, to weaken Hamas military capability, then get out. They say there is no desire on the part of Israel to reoccupy Gaza. It's a small strip of land of almost 2 million people. Israel withdrew from Gaza back in 2000. No desire to reoccupy Gaza, but they want to cripple as much as they can Hamas.

Do you -- when you heard about what happened to Ruby's son and the fact there was no investigation until -- until now, what do you make of that? BUTTS: When I actually heard it, I was kind of shocked that there had been no investigation. Only they wasn't interested in trying to find out what was going on with her son, what happened, or nothing like that. COOPER: Ruby, do you have faith that the sheriff's department will actually do everything in their power now to investigate your son's death? ELLIS: Well, now I do; since CNN came in, I do. COOPER: Ruby, does it frustrate you that it took some outsiders coming in and starting to ask questions to get them to actually investigate the death of your son? ELLIS: Don't frustrate me, but it hurts. COOPER: Ruby, again, I'm so sorry for the loss of your son and that it's taken three years for an investigation to even begin.

It's a tale of two wars over at the Pentagon today. There are new and urgent concerns about Afghanistan. But the top brass is reporting significant improvements in Iraq. Let's go to our senior Pentagon Jamie McIntyre. He's working this story for us. Troops in Iraq, are they likely to be heading toward Afghanistan? JAMIE MCINTYRE, CNN SENIOR PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, it sure seems that way, Wolf. Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs just back from Iraq and Afghanistan, said he was very impressed with progress in Iraq and that he's going to be prepared, he believes, to recommend further troop drawdowns in Iraq come fall. Now, technically, he doesn't make that recommendation. But, as the senior adviser to the president and defense secretary, his recommendation will carry a lot of weight when General Petraeus makes his recommendation -- Wolf. BLITZER: If they don't get the troops from Iraq to move over to Afghanistan, where do they get the troops, because we know there's a huge shortage out there? MCINTYRE: Well, the problem is, the Pentagon did an about-face today. After saying for months they didn't have any troops to send to Afghanistan, now they say they are going to try and find them. The question is, where are they? If you don't send replacement troops to Iraq, you could send them to Afghanistan. But they're not going to be ready to go for months. And U.S. commanders on the ground in Afghanistan say they need additional forces right away. BLITZER: This all volunteer-force is under enormous stress right now, given the wars that are under way. Jamie is at the Pentagon.

He's trying to win over black voters. But, by several indicators, he's looking at a rather uphill battle. CNN's Dana Bash is working the story for us in Cincinnati -- Dana. DANA BASH, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, we're told several prominent black Republicans met with John McCain last week and urged him not to give up fighting for the black vote. He came in part because of that and in part to beef up his brand as a Republican not afraid to reach out.

But, Bianna Golodryga, why have successive U.S. administrations, Democrat and Republican, Obama, Trump, and Biden so far, we'll see, not gone that far, right, not gone to those steps where they severely impact Russia's, for instance, access to financial markets, to truly squeeze Russian behavior on things like cyberattacks? GOLODRYGA: Look, this is something that's been debated, especially over the past several years, even going back into the Obama administration, as to how far these sanctions should go and how targeted they should be. From a bigger perspective, you know, Russia is not so closely tied to the U.S. market, as many other countries would be. Russia just recently pulled out of reserves in the U.S. dollar, and Russia's economy has been sliding over the past few years, but not to the point, clearly, to where you would see Vladimir Putin reconsider some of his actions. Domestically in Russia, they are seeing another wave of COVID spiking throughout Moscow. One of the reasons they didn't shut these cities down was because of concerns about the slowing economy and wanting to put more harm on Russians, in general. But in terms of targeting specific oligarchs and Putin, personally, that seems to be the main area right now where those who are advising the president are focused is to, if they are going to impose new sanctions, they should be tailored and they should be to where they impact Putin and not necessarily the Russian population. SCIUTTO: Yes. And, by the way, those sanctions do hurt those oligarchs, right? It restricts their travel, it restricts some of its financial transactions, and President Putin is close with a lot of oligarchs. In fact, he's been accused of being an oligarch himself, based on the fortune that he has amassed. Bianna Golodryga, Natasha Bertrand and Matthew Chance, thanks to all of you.

OK, let's move on because here's another interesting optic, Inauguration Day, and what's going to happen because it has just been announced that Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton are going to go to Donald Trump's inauguration. Did they - could they have skipped this one? GREGORY: I think it's very hard. I mean the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes America great, just one of the things that makes our democracy great. It's such an important part of who we are. Thinking back in history, despite the bitter political feud between Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, there's the story of Lincoln standing up at his inauguration and looking for a place to put his stovepipe hat, and it's Stephen Douglas who takes it from him and rests it on his lap. I think in that tradition, Hillary Clinton's going to be there. She's married to a former president. And Donald Trump is now part of a very small club of living former presidents. It's totally appropriate that, when they're able, that they should show up and mark this transition. CUOMO: All right, David Gregory, appreciate it, as always.

We'll have extensive coverage of the first weekend of border patrols in Arizona.

Two days after the pope died his body is tonight lying in state in St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Thousands of people are filing past his body, paying their last respects. As many as two million people are expected to view his body before the pope's funeral this coming Friday. Jim Bittermann has the report from Vatican City -- Jim. JIM BITTERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lou, in fact there are thousands more waiting to see his body this evening. This is rather an incredible scene on what -- in a day that's been filled with incredible scenes. There are tens of thousands of people still waiting to see the pope's body. The Vatican says the doors will stay open here until 2 a.m. in the morning, and they will then close down for about three hours because they have to do some cleaning and some technical work to get things ready for that Friday funeral. But people are still pouring in here. And just to give you an idea, back behind the camera, there's about 500 yards of people waiting in line. And as you look across St. Peter's Square, you can see the long line for maybe 300 yards across St. Peter's Square. And then once you get into St. Peter's Basilica it's another perhaps 200 yards to the pope's body itself. So all total you're talking about probably more than a half mile of people who are stacked 20 or 30 across waiting to see the pope's body. Obviously, they're not going to -- a lot of them are not going to get a chance to do that tonight. They'll probably be told in just a few minutes now to be -- to come back tomorrow. At least the ones at the end of the line. And they all have to just wait for another day.

A new ""ABC/Washington Post"" poll out this morning shows 52 percent approve of the job he is doing, his handling of the pandemic getting the highest marks, though a majority also want the president to aim for Republican support with major changes to his proposals. PAUL: Now, the newest item on his to do list is his American Families Plan. In his address he's expected to pitch an infrastructure overhaul as well and there are the tense issues of course of performing gun laws -- reforming rather gun laws and policing.

If you look at a church setting as long as people are not congregating in the lobby and when you're seated, you're sitting 6 feet apart wearing a mask, I think that it is possible. I mean, a lot of churches are hurting and I can see why they want their members to get back to church. And I think things can be done. Even one simple thing could be making sure that you made the offering online so that that basket is not passed down the pew. Simple things can be done to make it possible. CHURCH: Yes, that is critical, isn't it. And you know, some of the faith leaders are going slowly. They do want to take it slowly, others not so much. And doctor, I wanted to ask this. Because now we're learning that Centers for Disease Control and 11 states have been counting antibody tests in with diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Which clearly would inflate the numbers showing the level of testing. What's your response to this revelation? MATTHEW: Very disturbing. Ultimately if you think about it, one of the measures of the metrics by whether we are ready to open a state is that downward trend of cases for two weeks. So if you're mixing the results of an antibody test, which reveals previous infection, and you're mixing that with a COVID-19 or a viral test, which means a current infection. Yes, you're inflating the numbers and almost giving people that impression that testing is available and that you're ready to open. And then really quickly as well, it's really important that we know people that are positive. Because if you test positive for a COVID-19 infection, that means that you are potentially infectious and that you can transmit that virus unknowingly.

AMY HASSELWANDER, PRINCIPAL, JENNY LIND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: Leila was beautiful and strong. She was kind. I remembered that Leila liked purple. SIMON: Leila's family, among the mourners. Her 12-year-old brother, the one who told police that an intruder stabbed his sister while they were home alone and their parents were at a little league baseball game, a story authorities now say was a lie. GARY KUNTZ, SHERIFF, CALAVERAS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA: At 5:10 p.m., detectives arrested Leila's 12-year-old brother at the Valley Springs substation on a charge of homicide. (END VIDEOTAPE) BANFIELD: That was Dan Simon reporting for us. And charges of homicide for Leila Fowler's brother, 12 years old. This could be probably one of the cases that would show the youngest-ever tried for murder if it actually gets that far. There have been others, yes, very young. But, again, 12. And as of right now, police are keeping the details of this entire investigation pretty darn close to their vest. But we have learned -- in fact, we have just learned that that boy apparently was suspended from school earlier on this year, got a five-day suspension we are told, apparently for bringing a pocket knife, a small pocket knife to school. And by the way, one of the details that police have not revealed is what kind of knife was used in the murder of Leila Fowler, but they have been looking at some of the knives inside the Fowler home. Danny Cevallos is a criminal defense attorney who joins me live from Philadelphia. Danny, this is an arrest that happened on Saturday, but the details and the arraignment are somewhat delayed. Given the fact that we're dealing with a 12-year-old, is that any surprise to you? DANNY CEVALLOS, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Not at all. When it comes to the juvenile system, the minor's identity is closely safeguarded. These hearings, these proceedings and the information are often not publicly available information. Many lawyers can't even find that stuff online. We have to go downtown to the courthouse and physically look at an old-fashioned file because the idea is we",0.5733890856004791,2013-05-13

This was also pretty -- you saw a dysfunctional marriage on display. The presidency is a fishbowl. And all of those things are exacerbated and being covered 24 hours a day. I don't think she made many efforts, Melania, in hiding her anger and displeasure. CAMEROTA: Speaking of President Trump's behavior around other women, here's an interesting nugget we haven't heard before. There was apparently this young attractive press aide and President Trump acted so lecherously around this person, according to Stephanie Grisham. Grisham write, ""President Trump became obsessed with a young female press aide,"" who was not named in the book. The president constantly asked where the aide was during press events,"" Grisham wrote. And allegedly once requested she be brought to his cabin on Air Force One so he could look at her butt, basically. I mean, not surprising. But this is the kind of thing that you would expect from, you know, a middle schoolboy, not the president of the United States. Natasha? ALFORD: Nothing surprising about it, right? And yet, his followers, they would elect him no matter what, right? We saw grabbing women by the private parts. He mocked rape accusers by saying that they weren't attractive enough to be assaulted. I mean, there's nothing here that is surprising. But you know what I think is really some interesting tea is the way that Melania Trump responded to Stephanie Grisham's accusations. Both of the Trumps kind of took this misogynistic stance towards her, and essentially said, well, you know, she's had failed relationships, she was bitter from a breakup. And so Melania Trump falling in line with misogyny and falling in line with her husband's political agenda. (CROSSTALK) NAVARRO: They had her around for years, right? This is not, as Trump usually does, who is that? I don't even know them. This is a coffee boy or coffee girl. She was around in one capacity or another in Trump world, Trump political world for years. And, look, I don't even think it's Trump acting as a high school boy. I think it's Trump acting as Donald Trump. That vignette you talked about harkens back to Miss Universe, when he would walk into the dressing room to see all of the women getting dressed. It harkens back to him rating women, giving them a rank of she's a 10, she's an eight, she's a six. So, you know, it's very typical of Donald Trump. And again, it just goes back to remind us what a horrible, disgusting, lecherous man was elected president of the United States. CAMEROTA: I do feel the need to read his statement on her book, which is: ""Too bad that sleazebag publishers continue to report this very boring garbage. We in the MAGA movement are totally used to it. And some day in the not-too-distant future, we will have our voice back",0.6428824527162043,2021-09-29

And, you know, unfortunately, that means you have to kill some Russians and that is the only thing they understand. They only understand pure power. And we have to give the Ukrainian Army and Special Force the ability to do that. WHITFIELD: Do you feel you have full cooperation with allied nations? GALLEGO: Look, from what I understand from my conversations with the administration, we do have, at least at this point, some cooperation when it comes to -- on the economic sanctions. I think there is just going to have to be a lot more work when it comes to the other areas when it comes to potentially military capabilities to be able to help the Ukrainians to resist, you know, the influx and the invasion of Russia to Ukraine. Look, we need to accept that this may happen. This may be the largest land invasion in the European Theater since World War II. And I think there's a lot of people, both in the United States government, as well as the European Theater that aren't saying that this may happen. But from what we've seen in the past with Putin, whether he is acting in Georgia, whether he gas acted here, and other states around the world, including Syria, this man does not conform to norms. So we need to accept that this may happen. We have to ready our allies as well as Ukraine who is going to bear the brunt of this to accept what's going on and make them ready for it.

But this is, seems to me, a long shot, to say the least. BALDWIN: Elise Labott, final thought from you? LABOTT: Well, I think Aaron is right, but when it comes to the policy, it really has one word, and that is China. Secretary Tillerson was here asking countries to take action against North Korea. But he also pointed out that China has 90 percent of North Korean trade. And I think that's one statistic that has really struck President Trump when they were doing this review. And that's why he's really put most of his eggs in President Xi Jinping's basket, because he's saying, look, if China is not going to come to the table, this is really not going to work. So when Secretary Tillerson is threatening to sanction other countries if they do business with North Korea, that's really a message to China. Now, they have taken some steps, not as much as the U.S. would like. And I think it remains to be seen how much pressure China is really willing to put on North Korea, because Aaron spoke about 2005. China cut oil shipments to North Korea very briefly to bring them back to the table. That's the kind of action that the U.S. wants to see again. BALDWIN: We would have to see. Yes, Elise, thank you. Aaron David Miller, thank you as well. MILLER: Thank you. BALDWIN: Next, President Trump spending day 99 in office at the NRA convention in Atlanta.

The Pakistani opposition leader and former prime minister had wanted to lead a protest march to Islamabad. But for the second time in two weeks she found herself surrounded by police and unable to leave her house. That must have been the last straw. In an interview with CNN, Bhutto called President Pervez Musharraf to give up power entirely. Before she just insisted he give up his military post and even then she was trying to work out a power sharing deal. At this point Bhutto says there is a quote, ""Total trust deficit."" Amid the rumblings that the government is planning to deport her, Bhutto says she is in the dark about her fate. CNN's Zain Verjee has more on where Bhutto stands. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAIN VERJEE, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: Benazir Bhutto tried to hold a rally for the second time and for the second time the masses have not come out onto the streets. She is being held under house arrest in her home a few blocks down that way. She's been ringed by hundreds of police and security forces like these heavily armed. According to police sources about 3,500 of her supporters have been arrested. As this clamp down goes on Benazir Bhutto's rhetoric has also hardened. She says that General Musharraf should resign as army chief and he should no longer be president even. CNN has also learned that deputy secretary of state John Negroponte will be in Pakistan al little later this week. He was actually already scheduled to be here, but obviously the current situation is precarious, the U.S. is concerned and this is going to be top of his agenda. Zain Verjee, CNN, Lahore.

Who are Washington fixtures, to assert and to insist to voters that they, in fact, are new and they are vibrant and their ideas are new and they are vibrant, and they align with where this party is going, as the party continues to change demographically, as it continues to bring more young people into leadership roles. And again, that is one of the key questions about, where does this party go in a post-Barack Obama world, in a world where the leadership starts to change over, no matter who the next president is. (CROSSTALK) CABRERA: Although, Joe Biden has been really leaning into his attachment to the Obama administration. LOWERY: Certainly. CABRERA: And he is not necessarily trying to say, I'm different than what you're used to. It is almost, at least my interpretation from his messaging, is, I am somebody who is safe, you can trust, you know me already, not that he's some kind of, you know, big ground-breaker. What do you think is working for him, in that regard, Margaret? TALEV: Well, I mean that is -- you're right, you're exactly right. Joe Biden's message is completely different than Bernie Sanders' message in terms of the pitch to voters for why they should choose him. And I think for the candidates like Joe Biden, or I don't know, Pete Buttigieg, if you're more of a centrist approach, or if you're going to rely more on your experience governing across party lines or whatever, you have a different calculus when you're trying to figure out how closely to align with Alexander Ocasio-Cortez or some of the newer House members, further to the left House members, it is really a different calculus. If you're Bernie Sanders, you're already not going to get some of those cross-over voters that are looking for a very moderate candidate, or you're not likely to get them unless they're voting currently in the sort of against-Trump category. If you're a more centrist Democratic candidate, you are asking yourself, yes, I would like this person's support but do I want to align with them on the Green New Deal or, you know, policies X, Y, Z. For Bernie Sanders, part of that alignment is a natural one. He is courting her support because they are allies and partners in many ways already on the Hill.

LEMON: He is a former NATO supreme allied commander. He joins us this evening. First of all, thank you for your service, especially considering that we've just gotten some of the names of our service members who sadly perished in that bombing yesterday and that explosion yesterday. General Clark, the president vowed to make these terrorists pay just yesterday, and then today, he has approved the strike. Lightning fast or what you expect it? WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Of course, we are going to strike. Wherever we can find them, wherever we can hit them, we are going to strike and strike and strike and strike again. This is ISIS. It is ISIS-K. They are an enemy to humanity. So, yes, we are going to continue to strike. But this strike is apparently by an unmanned aerial vehicle, probably (INAUDIBLE) missile, maybe hit an SUV, may have hit a house or something. It is not a killing blow against ISIS. These are necessary strikes. How many of them are sufficient? Unknown. These terrorist groups have proved over two decades to be very, very resilient. Even when you take out of the top leadership, someone else comes in. You got to get in on the ground. You got to disrupt the networks. You got to rip up the papers, destroy the communications, and disperse the groups and finish them. We haven't been able to do that. In fact, all these terrorists groups have metastasized here in North Africa, Libya. They are threatening Nigeria. They are going down east coast of Africa. There are elements in South America. So, we know we've got a significant problem. We will do the best we can with these kinds of strikes, but we are still searching for the real solution here. LEMON: So, general, is it more dangerous for our troops, for the U.S. to conduct this attack while all our forces are defending the airport and trying to evacuate in just a few days? That deadline is Tuesday. It's Friday. It's coming quickly. CLARK: Absolutely now more dangerous. The more you can do right now to disrupt these groups, the better. They are not deterred by the thought that some of them may die. They are not deterred by the fact that the United States may retaliate. They are not going to wait for the fact. They are not going to be softer because the United States doesn't take military action. This is a brutal, head-to-head, hand-to-hand struggle and you got to do as much as you can to destroy their network so you can keep them off balance. It is the key to helping secure Americans.

And I just came from where the floor was, our colleagues Deirdre Walsh and Manu Raju and others, are over by the meeting. And they are reporting very grim faces, a very deep sense of disappointment, and understanding of what this means. And, as you said, if we can just take a step back and talk about what this means, this was the fundamental, major promise election after election after election that won the House of Representatives for Republicans in 2010, that won the Senate for Republicans as well, that helped win the White House for this Republican president. And here we are, not even 100 days in to President Trump's administration, and what the speaker is telling his rank and file right now -- and Manu Raju just had this reporting -- I'm looking at his text right now -- that not only is this dead. He believes and his intention is to move on from health care for the rest of this Congress. It is really stunning, stunning to think about that, to take a step back and wrap your head around the idea that these Republicans and the House of Representatives voted 60-some times over and over again for show votes, saying that they're going to repeal Obamacare, and obviously knowing at the time that it was not possible because there was a man named Obama in the White House who would never sign such a thing. Now there isn't, and they're not going to get this done.

KOCH: Five carriers are trying the elite lines in more than a dozen cities in part because surveys showed a quarter of business travelers were considering cutting back on travel because the process had become so grueling. Those cooling their heels in regular security lines have mixed feelings about the new practice. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They get a better service for higher price. I mean, that's really all right with me. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the security thing is everybody's issue. And to make that easier for privileged because of what money they pay is not at all fair. KOCH: Airlines aren't ashamed of putting profits before parity. PETE MCDONALD, SR. VP OF AIRPORT OPERATIONS, UNITED AIRLINES: Is it fair? We have been doing it since Wilbur and Wright. Just like we differentiate at our ticket counter and how we differentiate in our red carpet rooms and onboard the aircraft, we provide special service to our best customers. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you believe it? KOCH: By giving up a little privacy in the future more travelers could join that elite crowd. Airlines and airports are promoting trusted traveler cards. (on camera): Applicants would submit personal information and undergo a criminal background check. In return, they get a card embedded with data like fingerprints as a failsafe way to identify them as posing no security risk. CHIP BARCLAY, AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF AIRPORT EXECUTIVES: Why do we want to put them through a rigorous process every time they fly if we can do that once and then confirm their identity every time they went through the system. KOCH: But questions remain about two who have access to travelers personal information, and whether it's appropriate it grant security privileges base owned a person's financial or frequent flyer status.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL MULVILHILL, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI CLASS OF 1970: When the Kent State shooting took place, you heard that from an individual. You heard it from a person who had emotion. You didn't hear it on your cell phone or get a text about it. I think that caused that time to be much more meaningful and personal to people than maybe sometimes are today. So the opportunity to kind of close that loop, I think, was important to many of us. WHITFIELD: Do you remember that as if it were yesterday? MULVILHILL: I remember the closing of schools as if it were yesterday. I remember the turmoil on campus. It was such an emotional time with all the issues going on around the country. And when Kent State took place, it was such an unbelievable moment that it's hard not to remember it. WHITFIELD: How much of that moment and the ripple effects did you think of during this year's ceremony? MULVILHILL: Well, it was hard not to think about it because it was really the reason that we came together. It's something when you live through something like that; it's something you never forget. I think we all had somewhat tears in our eyes a little bit thinking about the emotional time and the ability to bring closure to that. WHITFIELD: The 2010 graduates can't possibly understand. They're so far removed from that experience. But did you find you and other graduates of 1970 trying to kind of explain or educate the class of 2010 about what this really means? MULVILHIL: Yes, we had several opportunities to interact with some of the graduates from this year. They have their own challenges going on in the world. But they were very interested in what had happened at that time. They really didn't understand the total impact of it. And I think they appreciated the fact that we took time to come back and celebrate. And they gave us a very nice, warm reception when we came back.

I love questions from kids, because, first of all, they always ask things that are surprising, and I think oftentimes ask things that adults maybe are embarrassed to ask, about, you know, police officers, you know, having to catch bad guys, I think is how she put it. You know, it's interesting, because police officers, and other people who are on the frontline, oftentimes have to wear personal protective equipment, as well, because they're doing this job. They don't know if the person they're going to be potentially coming in contact with is carrying the virus. So, in addition to doing the job, they often have to wear the personal protective equipment, and then sterilize all their gear afterward. So it's a new world for every frontline worker in this regard. COOPER: And I know you're -- so, you're answering more of these questions every week on CNN's Instagram.

Biological and nuclear weapons. We thought that. Wants get to into bed with other people. Let`s take Syria. Syria, Israel, just bombed a nuclear power plant there. You think that was for making energy? BARR: Now they`re talking with them. You have to maintain a relationship with these countries. It is not in the interests of Saudi Arabia to see a regime in Iran that has nuclear weapons, which, by the way, they`re not likely to get any time soon. But aside from the time frame here, we need to work with the other countries in the Middle East in, as allies to take care of the problem in Iran, not to go in there militarily and crush Iran. BECK: I didn`t mean -- when I said they wanted to crush Iran, wanted to plant -- the idea was to plant democracy on both sides of Iran and let people stand up for themselves and show that freedom works. And hey, it`s sweet over here. That would have inspired the people in Iran to crush their own... BARR: How many -- how many generations it would take in order to establish anything approaching our notion of democracy over there? BECK: Bob, I`m not arguing that it was the right thing to do. I`m arguing that we`re there now. Finish the job. Stabilize it as much as you can. Help those people stand on their own. Because you cannot pull out and let that be -- nature hates a vaccuum. BARR: It`s not so much pulling out as it is making clear to the Iraqi government that they are, in fact, going to have to take responsibility for their own economic well-being, their own political well-being and their own national security.

BLITZER: We heard earlier in the day from the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, in London, suggesting that the referendum, in her words, ""probably passed."" After that, they seemed to be backing off a little bit. Did you speak with her after she made that comment? KHALILZAD: Well, I've spoken to her a number of times in the course of the day. I think it's too soon to tell, Wolf, with regard to the passage. But we have to focus on what happened yesterday -- and what happened was that Iraqis did participate; the security forces played a vital role in ensuring that the terrorists were not able to disrupt the referendum. And either way, there is a path forward and we can be very pleased with the development yesterday. BLITZER: Even if it fails? Is there a possibility it could fail? KHALILZAD: Oh, yes. It is possible that it could fail, and it's possible that it could pass. It was in the hands of the Iraqi people. Efforts were made to accommodate as many people as possible, but if it fails, there will be elections in December, and a new assembly will be established, and that assembly will take up the task of drafting a new constitution. And if it succeeds, there is also a path forward. So it's very important to focus now on the success that was achieved yesterday, with the participation of the Sunnis. Now, it is clear that the Sunnis have confidence in the process -- and that's demonstrated by their participation. BLITZER: Even if they voted in large numbers against this constitution, does that still mean that they have confidence in the process -- even if they voted against it? KHALILZAD: Sure, because that shows that their voice matters, that the political process provides avenues for effecting the situation, that the military option is not the right option but that's the political process is the best way for Iraqis to accommodate with each other. Clearly, it would be better for all concerned if the constitution passes with support from all communities. But if, based on the law that exists, the rule of law, three provinces by two-thirds reject it, that would show that the voice of those people who said ""no"" through political participation did matter. And I think that should further increase the confidence of people in the political process. BLITZER: Why, in your opinion, was there less violence, less insurgent attacks yesterday than many had feared? When we spoke on Friday, for example, you told me you feared something significant could happen. What turned out to work in terms of cutting down on the insurgency on this election day?

Tonight, Donald Trump endorses Mitt Romney in Vegas of all places. Also, Virginia talks Newt Gingrich's vow to fight on through the Southern GOP primaries and what he would say if asked to join the Republican ticket. And this school's new chancellor, the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, talks exclusively to us about how fast to pull out of Afghanistan and how much he agrees with his former boss's GOP critics. We begin with today's verbal fireworks on Capitol Hill in Washington. In the face of pointed and personal attacks by House Republicans, the Attorney General Eric Holder today rejected calls for his resignation and he refused to take the blame for a program that sent U.S. guns to Mexico's drug gangs in an effort to trace gun smuggling. Attorney General Holder says he shut down the program dubbed Operation Fast and Furious shortly after it came to his attention. He says that was after one of those smuggled guns was found at the murder scene of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. Some Republicans accuse General Holder of covering up what he knew. Others today -- listen to this -- called him incompetent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I believe that the American people deserve to have an attorney general that they can trust. And for that reason, I have asked for your resignation. And I believe that because you have been grossly incompetent in the way that you have prepared before coming to Congress, I think you should resign. ERIC HOLDER, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Looked at fairly, I think that I have done a pretty good job. Have I been perfect? No. Have I made mistakes? Yes. Do I treat the members of this committee with respect? I always hope that I do. And what you have just done is, if nothing else, disrespectful.

ANN MARIE BUERKLE (R), NEW YORK: How many more Border Patrol agents would have had to die as a part of Operation Fast and Furious for you to take responsibility? HOLDER: I'm not claiming to be a perfect person or a perfect attorney general. I get up every day and try to do the best job that I can. I have great faith in the people who work in the department.

And so, this is what they have as far as some of the grand jury witnesses changed their stories. One witness admitting to mental disorder and that she has, quote ""has trouble distinguishing the truth from other things she has read online."" That's one witness. Another witness, according to the Associated Press, told the FBI, he saw Brown get shot in the back, but they be he later admitted to the grand jury, he actually hadn't seen that part of the shooting at all. You know, we have heard this week, in the wake of the decision from the grand jury, New York mayor, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani's, you know, strong words, saying these witnesses in altering their stories, should be prosecuted for perjury. Diana, do you agree? AIZMAN: I think that perjury requires an intent element that they're going to have trouble proving here. Obviously, it was a very emotional situation. It was probably pretty traumatic for the people that witnessed it. And so, maybe they thought they saw something or believed something that they saw was true, but they are genuinely confusing their memories with something that they may have heard later, that diluted that memory. BALDWIN: And then, John, I know a lot of Wilson's supporters, they're pointing their finger at Dorian Johnson, right? He was the friend, he was there. He was the eyewitness. He'd been in the convenience store. We know Dorian Johnson was the first to say that it was Brown who had his hands up, a version of events that the grand jury apparently didn't believe. You know, Dorian Johnson still, he was on with Erin Burnett the other night, and he said, my story is true, I'm telling the truth. What do you make of that? MANUELIAN: Brooke, I've reviewed some of the grand jury transcripts. I've gone through some of what the witnesses have said. And some of the witnesses actually corroborate Dorian Johnson's testimony. But what I take issue with is, why did this prosecutor allow an affirmative defense during the grand jury proceeding? It never happens. I've never heard of a prosecutor inviting a police officer to explain himself in front of the grand jury. And I think that's what Ferguson has a problem with. I think they have a problem, because this officer was afforded certain due process rights that typically, most people aren't entitled to. And it's the appearance of impropriety that is upsetting the community. And I think that is what I have to take issue with at this point.

Now, a lot of things still have to happen in order for that to -- for them to get to that place. Remember, they were still talking about, how were they going to pay for this. That was the big question more than anything else, is, how do they pay for it? Republicans had offered up a gas tax. Democrats saying that was off the table because it violated President Biden's promise not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000. So they have been trying to sort through that. But the news being from Senator Manchin that he sees hope that a deal could be on the horizon. So, Alisyn, we will continue to monitor that.

And CNN, like many other news organizations, is not allowed into Syria so we can't confirm these reports independently. Now Afghan president Hamid Karzai is meeting with tribal elders in Kabul for a gathering known as a Loya Jirga. Mr. Karzai told tribal elders today that a security pack with the U.S. is in Afghanistan's best interests. And he indicated that Afghanistan is ready to host U.S. troops for the long-term on certain conditions. The United States will send up to 2,500 marines to Northern Australia, enhancing the two nations' military alliance. The deployment was announced by both leaders during President Obama's visit to the long time ally as part of a regional tour. And the tents are gone, but protesters are back in New York's Zuccatti park. A New York court sided with the city, saying demonstrators can return, but cannot camp in the public space. Now also banned, tarps, and generators. Now police cleared the area overnight on Tuesday. And the Occupy movement, it reaches its two month milestone on Thursday, but it seems New York is not the only city ready for protesters to clear out now.

And the reason for this was that he belonged to a group that the Germans and other intelligence agencies in Europe believed were plotting attacks in Central Europe and that they were in communication with members of ISIS back in Syria. So that was the big concern. So one of the first things they did is put him on the no-fly list. KEILAR: Do your sources believe that ISIS was directing these attacks or that it might just have inspired them? PEREZ: That's the big concern right now. The intelligence agencies here and in Europe believe that, despite the pressure that ISIS is under in Syria, in Iraq, that they are capable of directing, still doing command and control operations, directing attacks -- PEREZ: -- in Europe, in Turkey, so that's at the top of everybody's mind right now , is how to stop that communication and also how to prevent these attacks, because these guys have all of the advantages. Only they know where they're going to strike next. KEILAR: Evan's going to stay with us. We're going to bring in more of our terrorism experts. We have CNN national security analyst, Peter Bergen; CNN intelligence and security analyst, Bob Baer and former CIA military analyst, Tara Maller. So, Peter, we're learning that obviously Berlin was very familiar with this individual. The U.S. was familiar with him. Is it possible that this was a failure on the part of German officials but that it's also something that is just very difficult to prevent, this idea of slipping through the cracks? PETER BERGEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, maybe both. It's clearly a failure but it wasn't like he went out and bought very, very exotic explosives. He hijacked a truck. That's pretty hard to prevent. Clearly this is going to be a huge problem for Angela Merkel. She was already in deep political trouble because of the various crimes refugees have been involved in. But here we have an asylum seeker carrying out this mass casualty attack. And it's going to be politically very hard for her to excuse this. KEILAR: So even when he's sort of -- he's in the deportation pipeline. He's run into law enforcement. There's a police informant who knows that he's talking about doing these things, that's not enough to go after somebody. Or there's just so many possibilities like that, that is it hard for German authorities to say this guy is a priority? BERGEN: I'm not sure what the German legal framework is for a guy keeping the case open. Obviously in this country, at a certain point, if you don't have enough derogatory information, you have to close it.

A number of people were sprayed with pepper spray, but there were no serious injuries as far as we could see. It was shocking to some and it was outrageous to some, but it was efficient. In all, it lasted only about three minutes before they had Elian Gonzalez outside and in a car. A very different mood out here today alongside Biscayne Bay. This is an Easter service. It started at 6:30 this morning at the Ernita de la Caridad (ph). It's a church here in Coconut Grove, Our Lady of Charity, about 200 people in attendance here. It is a service dedicated to Elian Gonzalez, who was a member of this community for about five months and, of course, today he is about 800 miles away with his family up in the Washington, D.C. area. Ernita de la Caridad in Coconut Grove has long been a center of Cuban-American religious activity. This is where people, Cuban- Americans come when there are problems in this country.

Within days, Elian had become a heroic figure in Miami's Cuban community. UNIDENTIFIED CUBAN-AMERICAN: It's definitely a miracle. ZARRELLA: A symbol of the 40 year plight of Cubans seeking freedom from Castro. And within days the bottom lines were being drawn across the Florida Straits. M.

And here's how we can illustrate the apparent crack that's formed within the religious establishment. On one land, you have Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who is supposed to be the ultimate word on most matters. He's come out squarely behind President Ahmadinejad. On the other hand, we have these very influential clerics who are clearly rejecting the most powerful man in Iran, saying this is not over. LEMON: Does this at all, I guess, reignite the opposition movement? Because they have still been protesting, they have been protesting for three weeks now. But does it ramp up even more, Reza? SAYAH: Well, they haven't been protesting out in the streets, but this is certainly a positive development for them. The Iranian government has shown no hesitation in aggressively going after average citizens and even opposition political leaders to shut them up. But clearly, it's not going to be easy going after senior clerics with batons and clubs. I mean, imagine security forces and the Revolutionary Guards going after senior clerics. It's not going to be as easy. And this is important for the hundreds of thousands who come out in the streets and protested. They are wondering what's next, who is going to lead us, do we have anyone in the establishment willing to carry our cause. And it looks like this particular group does. LEMON: Hey, Reza, talk to us also about the British embassy employee, because the British government had a very stern warning to the government in Iran. SAYAH: They have. I mean, this is Tehran and London continuing to lock horns over the past couple of weeks. Iran has made an all-out effort to shift the focus from the internal issues to the U.K., blaming all the turmoil on the British government. They have, at least, one local employee of the British embassy in custody, and here you have Foreign Minister David Miliband saying, if he is mistreated, there will be consequences. So, the face-off continues between London and Tehran. LEMON: All right. Reza Sayah -- Reza, we appreciate your reporting. Thank you very much.

Repealing and replacing Obamacare was a signature promise of this president. HARLOW (voice-over): Ricky Quinn says his healthcare costs are too high. RICKY QUINN, SECURITY GUARD: About $600 a month. That's what they take out of my pension check. HARLOW (on camera): For you and your wife? QUINN: Yes. The healthcare is actually a lot more than that because we pay a ton of stuff out of pocket. HARLOW (voice-over): He's gone from making $40 an hour as an autoworker just a few years ago to $14 an hour now working as a security guard. It's the best job he can find at this point, he says. (on camera): You are counting on the president to get healthcare reform through? QUINN: Yes, I believe that it should have gotten through. I know it's going to sound like I'm just a 100 percent Trump guy, but that's not the case. I really don't think it was his fault. HARLOW: He said, Ricky, day one - QUINN: He did. That's absolutely right. HARLOW: It will be so easy. And? QUINN: I think he's tried as hard as he can, but when you've got people fighting you like that, I really don't feel like he felt it was going to be that hard to do and I still think he's going to get it done. HARLOW: So, does a fix to healthcare mean throw out Obamacare or work to fix some parts of it? QUINN: It depends. I think you pretty much have to throw almost all of it out. Some of the big things like preexisting conditions need to stay. But as far as forcing people to buy insurance, I think that's where you're off. HARLOW (voice-over): Peggy and Jim Stewart have been married for 12 years, but they don't share the same politics. Peggy voted for President Trump. Jim did not.

KEILAR: There are millions of people who are living without power right now in Texas, as we told you. They are cold, some are even dying. This is a debacle of historic proportions after the severe winter storm knocked out the power grid. So what is the state's governor doing about this, in the middle of this crisis? He's tilting at windmills. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): This shows how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America. Our wind and our solar, they got shut down and they were collectively more than 10 percent of our power grid, and that thrust Texas into a situation where it was lacking power in a statewide basis. It just shows that fossil fuel is necessary for the state of Texas, as well as other states to make sure that we'll be able to heat our homes in the wintertime and cool our homes in the summertime. (END VIDEO CLIP) KEILAR: It's all the windmills' fault, Governor Greg Abbott says, not missing the chance to spin a yarn for political gain in the middle of a crisis. He blames renewable energy for the rolling power outages that have Texans seeking refuge in their cars as the temperatures in their homes drop into the 40s. But he's wrong. Experts say that it is a garden variety of reasons. But in Texas, which predominantly relies on natural gas, solar and wind sources are not even close to being the main factor here. First, Texas operates its own power grid, refusing the help of the federal system, which every other state relies upon, allowing them to more easily borrow power when it's needed, like during a disaster. But Texas makes like Fleetwood Mac and goes its own way. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the architects of the climate legislation, responded, quote, ""The infrastructure failures in Texas are quite literally what happens when you don't pursue a Green New Deal."" Now, second here for the real story of the power debacle in Texas right now, we direct you to the explanation of someone whose counsel Governor Abbott relies heavily on? Governor Abbott. Quote, ""The ability of some companies that generate the power has been frozen. This includes the natural gas and coal generators,"" he said. Abbott is on the hotseat and that means he's generating a lot of hot air, though unfortunately not enough natural gas, which is what Texas relies on most, especially when power is in high demand -- like right now, when more Texans need their heating systems on than usual. Abbott is not the only Texas leader in the spotlight today, as the blame game",0.2291182585300232,2021-02-17

Are we now seeing some of the more deadly effects of global warming on the wildlife in the arctic? CORWIN: It is -- Piers, it's very quite possible. I have spent a lot of time up in the Arctic studying and working with these bears. These are creatures that is exquisitely designed to survive on ice. But ice is not only a place where they are able to live, they need ice for their survival. Even though they are bears, we actually classified them as marine mammals because they have the ability to swim tremendous distances, but even these bears are now drowning because the perennial ice, that's the ancient ice that lasts from one decade to the next, has melted back so much they now enter a new world unexplored. A watery deadly world. And they need the ice. They will sit there, Piers, above a blowhole and they will wait for that seal to come up and take a breath, and with an arm so powerful, they'll reach through that blowhole and ice this thick and pull out a seal this wide through that hole. But the problem is if they don't have the ice, they can't survive. And it's very likely that we -- we may be looking at the first of our charismatic species to be facing potential extinction. There's only 25,000 left. We don't have many to spare. But unfortunately the ice continues to melt. MORGAN: Right.

Monica Lewinsky says that is not true. Let's discuss what's going on. Our Political Commentator Ana Navarro is here. What do you think about the assertion by Lynne Cheney that maybe the Clintons are all behind this, some sort of big, grand conspiratorial theory to get it out the way before Hillary Clinton runs in 2016, if she wants to run? ANA NAVARRO, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Gee, it sounds like a vast left wing conspiracy. BLITZER: Something like that. NAVARRO: Something like that. I think it sounds crazy. I think anybody who has ever known anybody or been through the pain of, you know, a spouse that had an affair would know that this is not something that you drug up willingly. I don't think it's being drug up by Republicans. I don't think it's being drug up by the Clintons. I think this is 40-year-old woman, and 40 is a big number for women; it makes a lot of us take stock of our lives, who has decided to take back her narrative. We've heard more about Monica Lewinsky this year between the question that got asked of Senator Rand Paul, between her 40th birthday. And now with this and the possible election of a nomination of Hillary Clinton than we have in the last 10 years. So, I think she wants to tell her story and her side of the story. BLITZER: Is it smart for someone like Senator Rand Paul, who is potentially a Republican presidential candidate, to start talking about Bill Clinton, who is widely admired, as a sexual predator or whatever words he used? NAVARRO: Well, in fairness to Rand Paul, he was answering a question that was posed to his wife. And so then, he was asked to respond to what his wife had said. It was not something that he brought out proactively. I think it's toxic politically. And I think it's run its natural life. It is, what, 15, 16 years ago. We haven't seen it harm the Clintons politically in all of that time. Hillary Clinton was re-elected since then. Bill Clinton is the most popular Democrat out there today, the most popular Democrat surrogate certainly. I think that horse has been beat to death.

Perhaps he should get them to watch the splendid, new American Experience documentary on the making of the Panama Canal. One hundred years ago, the United States completed what was then the most expensive, complex, but ultimately successful government program in human history. It was a project where everything went wrong. The French had tried to build the Panama Canal a few years earlier, and, despite putting the builder of the Suez Canal, Ferdinand de Lesseps, on the job, they left in total failure. The American project's first chief engineer quit after the first year. His replacement left as well. Only with the third did the project start moving. Yellow fever killed thousands of workers and caused others to flee in fright. The engineering challenges were immense and they often seemed insurmountable. Media reports about the project were largely negative. Then, in November 1906, Theodore Roosevelt visited the canal. It was the first time an American president had ever left the boundaries of the United States. Roosevelt, a Republican, was determined that the project continue and it be adequately funded. He turned his visit into on the first great presidential photo ops. Public support for the canal grew sharply after it. Through sheer perseverance, the age-old fantasy of connecting the world's two great oceans became a reality. The practical result was to cut travel time for goods and cargo between the east and the west coasts by an order of magnitude, igniting an explosion of trade. Today, more than 14,500 ships and 244 million tons of cargo pass through the canal annually. What are we doing today? What are we building today that people a hundred years from now will look back upon with pride? For more on this, go to cnn.com/fareed. There is a link to my Washington Post column.

I mean, I don't see anything in my lifetime that rivals it. HARLOW: Does this show us that you don't need a space apart. You don't all need to be there to occupy. You're occupying from here? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. I think that could be the next level of occupation. I personally think that we can't occupy the hearts and mind of people much easier than occupying a park.

ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Exactly. So, what is going to be happening, T.J., is that the Federal Reserve is going to be putting the nation's biggest banks under some big stress tests.

The only one they didn't say was that Khashoggi died in a free solo rock climbing accident. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRIGGS: A spokesperson for Netflix says they strongly support artistic freedom worldwide. But the group Human Rights Watch says, quote, ""Netflix's claim to support artistic freedom means nothing if it bows to demands of government officials who believe in no freedom for their citizens -- not artistic, not political, not comedic."" ROMANS: All right, let's get a check on ""CNN Business"" this morning. Minimum wages are rising in 2019. According to the National Employment Law Project, at least 19 states raised their minimum wage on or around New Year's Day. Now, many of those increases are to $15 bucks an hour. Minimum wage workers from Maine to Missouri to Arizona will see bumps in their paychecks immediately. According to a Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, business owners across the country say these increases will boost consumer spending, reduce employee turnover, increase productivity and customer satisfaction, and help the economy. But even as some states raise the minimum wage, the federal minimum has been stuck at $7.25 for the past decade. The bump comes after a rough year for stocks and fears about economic growth. In 2018, the S&P 500 fell 6.2 percent, the Nasdaq fell four percent, the Dow slipped almost six percent -- the worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and the S&P fell in the last decade. And take a look at where we are right now. Watching futures as we start up a new trading year. BRIGGS: Yikes. ROMANS: You have Dow futures lower here to the tune of 369",0.1194560225627714,2019-01-02

CUOMO: Now, what does it tell you that the - I mean, look, we both grew up watching these things. The conservatives have had very established platforms, about high principle, and what they want.

CUOMO: But on ""And there was fraud! And there was fraud!"" What does that mean to you? COSTAS: Either - either you have cultists, who really believe, despite all the evidence that Donald Trump is the answer, or you have people cynical enough, to say, ""Look, our base is devoted to him. So our political future lies in aligning ourselves with that, as much as we possibly can. And if we won't go full-throated, like some of the most extreme members of Congress, or people that are out there, in MAGA media, if we won't go full-throated, then we'll try to just slide past some of the stuff that we can't really rationalize, and change the subject to something else."" The last time I was on with you, I made this point. And I don't think I'm alone in this. I think millions upon millions of moderates, and people who think of themselves as left of center feel the same way. Wokeism and leftism are not the same thing as classic liberalism. They need to be called to account. They need to be opposed, even if some of it is what we might agree with. They need a thoughtful opposition. MAGA-world is not. It's many things. It ain't thoughtful. CUOMO: It does feel broken, doesn't it? I mean, we use that-- COSTAS: Yes. CUOMO: It's like tripe but true these days. ""Everything's broken! Everything's broken!"" COSTAS: Yes. CUOMO: But having this system where opposition is enough, look, nobody understands sport better than you. COSTAS: Right. CUOMO: You'll never find another competition, where it's enough for you to win, is if I lose. You're going to have to put up points. COSTAS: It's all zero - it's all zero-sum. CUOMO: That's right. And that's what a two-party system gets you, which is if opposition is enough. Opposition is now a saleable position. Look? That is what they're trying to approximate with the ""Big lie."" ""We're against what happened in the election. We're against how it's done."" The question is where does this get us? COSTAS: I don't think it gets us any place good.

It will be delivered to Buckingham Palace on an easel. And that's going to be the sign that the baby was born officially, but also we'll find out if it was a boy or a girl. So, everyone is gripped to their TV screens for the moment. BOLDUAN: Absolutely right. The world really fell in love with this couple from their fairy tale wedding and a very healthy baby on the way. Thanks, Max. CUOMO: Not just on an easel but first they put the announcement into a frame and then put it on the easel. BOLDUAN: What do you expect for a royal baby?

Well, people I have spoken to wishing the duchess a very healthy and safe delivery -- even the prime minister of United Kingdom, David Cameron, sending his best. As you mention, that birth notice will be driven to Buckingham Palace and displayed right over there on the gates of the palace forecourt. It will be displayed on the very same easel that carried Prince William's birth notice over 31 years ago. That will be followed by two separate, yet simultaneous gun salutes -- one at the park just adjacent to the palace and announcing to the world that the monarch is here. Back in the day before they had telephone and Internet, this is how the people would find out about the royal birth. So, a sense of history, a sense of tradition to the occasion. People here outside Buckingham Palace is pretty excited. BOLDUAN: And everyone -- many people around the world excited, as well. Thank you so much, Erin. We'll be back with you throughout the show.

And now somebody's like, oh, like the movie ""The Hurt Locker."" Yeah, kind of like that. SR. MASTER SGT. KYLE WALLER, U.S. AIR FORCE: At the end of the day, it's fiction. So knowing that, it's still portrayed us in a positive light in some respect. But I think it could have been better. CAPT. NICK VAN ELSACKER, U.S. AIR FORCE: There's usually modest people and that's why you're not going to hear them embellish the movie too much. Most of them are going to say it exaggerates what they do, even though every one of these guys is a living hero in one aspect or another. But they kind of draw the line at wanting to set themselves as being special in any way. They don't want to seem like they're any more special than your average soldier. BLITZER: General Ray Odierno, the commander of the U.S. forces in Iraq tells me he highly, highly recommends the film ""The Hurt Locker."" 45 years ago this week, a pivotal moment unfolded in the civil rights movement.

WINNIE MANDELA, FORMER WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA: I think it is the cruel thing to have expected him to have done more than he already has within just one year. Generations and generations of oppression, even though this is one of the longest democracies. I think his task is even more difficult, because I think the African Americans, for instance, would expect more. And countries like the African continent would expect more from him, because he's African American. And realistically, it is unfair. BLITZER: Winnie Mandela speaking to our Roland Martin.

And they constitute an aggression, an attack against our country, against its values, against its young people and against its way of life. They were done by a Daesh group who are fighting because France is a country of freedom, because we are the motherland of human rights.

Chertoff says 92 percent of the time, the employee is cleared on the spot. MICHAEL CHERTOFF, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We're creating a possibility for people to come into this country and work, doing it the right way, getting identified and paying their taxes. SYLVESTER: The pilot program would become mandatory for all employers under the Senate legislation. But the employment verification system has its flaws. A Government Accountability report found that an illegal alien who uses someone else's name and Social Security number would still be granted work authorization. Critics say to close this loophole and have the program expanded to some 6 million employers will take time. REP. BRIAN BILBRAY (R), CALIFORNIA: For somebody with a straight face to put into a law that, oh, we'll have all this done in 18 months, don't worry, when we haven't done it in 18 years, and -- I mean, how absolutely stupid do these senators think the American public is? SYLVESTER: The Senate bill's critics are dismissing other parts of the Senate proposal as unworkable. Among the questions, how to keep track when guest workers come and leave? How effective are the 24-hour background checks for millions of illegal workers? And will the bill actually reduce illegal immigration? The group NumbersUSA points to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that says the Senate bill won't make much of a dent in the numbers. ROY BECK, NUMBERSUSA: The grand bargain is, you give amnesty, you reward with permanent residence and permanent jobs to 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens in exchange for not having illegal immigration in the future. This bill, at most, will reduce it perhaps by 20, 25 percent. That's not good enough for a grand bargain. SYLVESTER (on camera): Bush administration officials are trying to reframe the Senate bill as a national and border security bill. But critics including NumbersUSA say if that's truly the goal, then why not just pass a bill that steps up security without putting illegal aliens on the path to citizenship or implementing a guest worker program?

But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women.

I`m much less interested if dad is talking to mom than if dad is talking to the police. GRACE: You know what, Pilar, you`re right. That`s an excellent point. Alan Ripka, what about the possibility of cops having a GPS detector on daddy`s car up under the hood, under where the tires are? Is that constitutional? ALAN RIPKA, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Sure, it is. I think they can follow him wherever they want. And there`s no the right privacy where he drives that automobile. And I`m sure they are following him and watching out for him. If he`s running they`re going to know they have a person of interest. GRACE: You know, Eleanor Odom, Ripka is absolutely right regarding no privacy interest in the car. Explain. ELEANOR ODOM, FELONY PROSECUTOR, DEATH PENALTY QUALIFIED: Well, you know, you don`t have a privilege or right to drive just like you don`t have a right to a driver`s license. So -- and because you`re out there in the open you should be able to get a GPS on it. There are -- there are some states that say no, you can`t do it so you just have to be a little bit careful.

Plus, how are investors reacting to news that the America's petroleum reserves will be tapped? Andy Serwer is ""Minding Your Business"" this morning. Good morning. ANDY SERWER, ""FORTUNE"" COLUMNIST: Good morning. A positive development there about the release of that strategic petroleum reserve and the investors reacting favorably. The price of oil has dropped a little bit and the stock market is up marginally. Still huge problems in the Gulf, as far as business goes. We have a picture of an oil rig that has washed ashore in Alabama. Look at that. Just on the beach. And the amazing part, Soledad, no oil company has yet claimed it. We don't know -- seriously. No one knows whose rig that is. S. O'BRIEN: We're laughing... SERWER: Truly remarkable. S. O'BRIEN: ... but that's not -- that's not even funny. SERWER: It's terrible. It's unbelievable what's going on. Let's move over to Mississippi, shall we, and talk about the gaming industry there. It's the third largest market after Las Vegas and Atlantic City, employing about 14,000 people, producing $330 million of revenue to the state of Mississippi. ""The New York Times"" says that's about 10 percent of the state's annual budget. Six casinos there basically wiped out or destroyed or heavily damaged. And you know, the interesting thing here is these casinos are technically riverboat casinos, so they're built to float. That put them directly in harm's way here. And the word is that probably, when all is said and done, the rules are going to change here, and they're going to build casinos on land and change the rules in the state of Mississippi, which seems to have sense. If you're going to have gaming, you might as well put the casinos... S. O'BRIEN: In an area where they're... SERWER: ... where they're safe. S. O'BRIEN: And when there are hurricanes. That's sort of a smart idea. Andy, thanks. SERWER: That's right. S. O'BRIEN: A short break. We're back in just a moment. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) S.

1932921,2249312,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"VIDEOCLIP) WHITFIELD: All right. You're listening to an update there coming from authorities, local authorities and national authorities as well, about this tragic accident happening late yesterday. A limousine carrying 18 people, according to police there, going through an intersection on where state routes 30 and 30-A come together, crashing into a parked vehicle that was at a country store there. There were two pedestrians near the parked vehicle in all. Now, 20 people were killed. Still unclear exactly what precipitated this collision. And very few details coming from authorities there in terms of the destination of that limousine and even the identity of the 18 people all killed pending next of kin nonfiction. All right. Joining me right now, Peter Goelz, a Former Managing Director with the NTSB. So, given what you heard there, so many unanswered questions. But you did hear the chairman of the NTSB there saying really it's one of the deadliest accidents that he can recall since 2009. What strikes you about the details that we were able to get there? PETER GOELZ, FORMER MANAGING DIRECTOR, NTSB: Well, I think it's clear that this horrific accident is going to get the attention of the NTSB. You know, in 2015, Senator Schumer from New York State asked the NTSB specifically to start monitoring and looking in-depth at these kinds of limousine accidents. And there's really going to be three or four areas that they're going to zero in on, Fred. The first is, of course, the driver. You know, was he speeding, was he appropriately licensed? Did he know the route? Was there any impairment either from drugs, alcohol or fatigue? But they're also going to look carefully at the vehicle. You know, this -- whether there were after market changes made to the vehicle which affected the -- its structural safety aspects. You know, this -- WHITFIELD: Meaning extensions sometimes these vehicles can be, you know, modified after -- GOELZ: Exactly. WHITFIELD: -- what the manufacturers that kind of thing. GOELZ: That's right. I mean, a Ford Excursion unless it's been extended greatly doesn't seat 18. And they'll also zero in on that question of seatbelts. The question is, should people sitting in the back of the limousine be required not only to wear, first of all, should they be required to have seatbelts and whether they should be required to wear them. I mean. that there was no one wearing seatbelts, which I think is going to end up being the case, is really going to change the law, I think on this. This is, you know, there is -- this is just a horrendous event and there are things that can be done that can mitigate. WHITFIELD: And, of course, we're looking at the videotape and images that have been supplied here. We see the vehicle, what he was describing as the 2001 Ford Excursion limo. And like you said, unclear whether it was, you know, extended post-manufactured, but you see it in",0.6915406162464985,2018-10-07

The big hope for Democrats is that they can get these young voters excited and that they'll end up going to the polls on Election Day. Dan Lothian, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) WHITFIELD: All right. So, now, let's talk about the week ahead in politics. Our Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser joins me now from Washington. So, Paul, the president heading the campaign trail again this week. What's the first stop for him? PAUL STEINHAUSER, CNN DEPUTY POLITICAL DIRECTOR: You got it. First stop will be Maryland on the campaign trail later this week, Fred. And he's going to go out there to help the incumbent Democratic governor right now, Martin O'Malley, who's fighting for re-election and thinks it's a tough rematch against a guy he beat four years ago, Republican Bob Ehrlich. And this will be interesting. This is one of the first times we'll see Barack Obama at an actual rally. He's been campaigning a lot this year, but mostly fundraisers. This is going to be an actual rally we haven't seen that many of those, Fred. WHITFIELD: Yes. And so we also hear the president will be making a stop in Chicago, his old hometown. Who is he campaigning for? STEINHAUSER: Yes. Among the things that he'll be doing in Chicago is campaigning for Alexi Giannoulis, who was the State Treasurer in Illinois and who's the Democrats nominee for the Senate seat there. It's a very tough re-election right now between him and Mark Kirk, the Congressman from the Chicago area, the Republican nominee. And remember, this is Barack Obama's old Senate seat. This is the one he stepped down from in late 2008 after he won the presidency. The Democrats really would like to keep this Senate seat as well as Joe Biden's old Senate seat in Delaware in party hands, Fred. WHITFIELD: OK. And then at the end of the week, he's not done. We're expecting that the last job numbers will be coming out. So, clearly, the president is likely to have to comment on that or at least will be asked about it no matter what the outcome. STEINHAUSER: Oh, no doubt. And, you know, I like to say and I think a lot of people would agree that the unemployment report is probably are even the most important number in politics right now. And this, as you said, would be the last one. On Friday, the Labor Department will release September's unemployment level. Right now it's 9.6 percent unless it,",0.1383205400260232,2010-10-03
1078965,1375714,CNN,Starting Point With Soledad O'Brien,"do you see in Bridgeport? ESME DEPREZ, REPORTER, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Exactly. I went to Bridgeport, the natural (ph) areas, right northeast of New York City, and that's home to the highest income divide in the U.S. So, you have extreme pockets of poverty right up against extreme pockets of wealth. So, places like Bridgeport which is a city with high child poverty rates, low unemployment, low incomes, and then you have it right next door to, you know, Greenwich, (INAUDIBLE) which has obviously hedge funds and lots of people that work in the financial industry that commute into Manhattan every day. So, they're really butting up against one another right here. O'BRIEN: You talk in the article about the Gatsby curve. What's that? DEPREZ: So, the great Gatsby curve was formulated by a university of auto economist (ph) named Miles Corak (ph). And he shows, he maps the measure of inequality against how wealth is transferred through generations. And so, what that curve shows us is that countries with high inequality also have low mobility or they tend to. And so, the U.S., if you look at the where the U.S. is up on the graph, you see the U.S. at the very top which signifies that we have here high inequality and low mobility at the same time, which is something that we don't typically think of when we think of the American dream. MARGARET HOOVER, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: What are the factors that most impact mobility, because it seems like, to me, you know, people who are compassionate. We believe in the American dream. We believe that people can make their way up in the world. And that's the thing. That's what we hedge the American dream on. It's the ability to at least improve your circumstances and be able to transcend the circumstances you were born in. That's the most concerning thing to me about your article is the freezing of the social strata almost. What are those factors? What impacts social mobility? DEPREZ: So, what this economist that I referenced in my article says impact mobility. It's family, of course, the material that we -- the advantages we give them both material and none we pass on to our kids. The labor market, how education is an important driver to get a good job, and then also just how level the playing field is. So, it's really dependent on public policy, as well. And what we see is that if you're born into poverty today, kids born into poverty for almost half of kids born into poverty today will stay stuck there until they die. So, that's exactly what we don't think of as the American dream, but that's what the statistics (ph) are telling us. O'BRIEN: How many people born into the middle class will slide down into poverty? DEPREZ: So, the middle class is more fluid. You have a roughly equal chance if you're born into the middle class to slide down or to move",0.7183977092065327,2012-07-05

Be sure to watch the ""Anderson Cooper 360"" exclusive interview with Karen McDougal tonight, 8:00, only here on CNN. The Austin serial bomber left a 25-minute confession video. The biggest question remains unanswered, why did he do what he did? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BERMAN: Investigators in Austin, Texas, say they still do not know why a 23-year-old suspect terrorized the city for weeks by sending package bombs to kill two people. This despite police finding a 25-minute confession on the cell phone that he had with him after he killed himself yesterday morning. Joining me now from outside Austin, Nick Valencia. Nick, what have you learned? NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're standing just a few feet away from that bomber's home and it's still being treated as an active crime scene as investigators continue to try to pour over what's inside to glean any information about motivation here. And, in fact, in a press conference yesterday, John, they say they may never know. But what they did get was some insight from that 25-minute cell phone video recording that investigators say was recorded the night before he detonated that bomb killing himself because they say he knew that investigators were closing in on him. Now, in that video recording, police say he doesn't talk anything about terrorism, nothing about targeting people of color or hate. But he did talk extensively about the six explosives that he used, as well as the seventh that he used to detonate as police were cornering him. We're also hearing a little bit more from his family today -- or yesterday, I should say. His aunt coming out saying that she's saddened by this tragedy.

Right now our prayers are for the families who lost loved ones, for those impacted in any way and for the sole of our Mark.

And I want to introduce Jasmine Simon from Nevada. She is a single mom who works two jobs, and she has a question for Senator Cruz. Jasmine? QUESTION: Like many Americans, I make hard decisions to support my daughter. One of the hardest choices has been postponing my college degree so that I can afford my daughter's daily needs. And one of the most expensive needs is childcare. I'm willing to sacrifice anything for my daughter, but working multiple jobs and still trying to make ends meet each month sometimes seems impossible. My question to you is that, isn't the child tax credit a little too late for families like mine, when I need to pay my bills every month, including childcare, not just in April? CRUZ: Jasmine, thank you for that question, and let me commend you. I've got to say, being a single mom may be the hardest job there is in the whole world. And I'll tell you, I come from a family of single moms. My sister was a single mom. Both my aunts were a single mom.

Yesterday we saw special politics units in Takhsin Square in fatigues with heavy weapons. This is an operation to find a man a lot of people are nervous about while he's still on the run. And the fact is, you know, since he could be, as ISIS claims, one of their operatives, there's a chance that he might be trying to get to Syria. And if that's the case, he slips into ISIS-controlled Syria, then it would be basically impossible for them to catch him. LU STOUT: Yeah, and as the manhunt goes on to try to find him before it's too late, we know that Turkey is reeling. Turkey has been hit by this relentless wave of violence over the last year or so. This latest attack must be raising even more serious questions about security in the country. LEE: You know, if we go back just before this last attack happened, people were talking about how this was going to be the pajama new year, that they he just didn't feel like they wanted to go out and celebrate because they were afraid something was going to happen. And security on the street was ramped up to make sure that something like the attack at that nightclub wouldn't happen, but despite all that, that ISIS operative was able to kill those people at that club and then sslip away. And Turkey has been dealing with quite a few terrorist attacks, whether they be from ISIS or Kurdish militants, the PKK. And here in the country, people are wondering why the government hasn't been able to stop that. You know, ISIS has been operating in Turkey for quite some time because of the neighboring civil war in Syria. At one time, Turkey was the gateway for militants to move in and out of Syria, although they clamped that down. ISIS still has cells in the country and Turkish police, Turkish security forces are trying to root those out and 14 people have been detained in connection with this. They're interrogating them.

MATTINGLY: The change, a new amendment negotiated by Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows and a member of the more moderate Tuesday Group Tom MacArthur would allow states to apply for waivers that could weaken several key Obamacare insurance reforms, including the price protections in place for those with preexisting conditions, what benefits insurers must cover in their policies, and the ban on allowing carriers to charge more based on a person's health background. REP. TOM MACARTHUR (R), NEW JERSEY: My one and only goal in this has gone to try to make this bill something that helps the health insurance market survive. MATTINGLY: But all eyes are now on the party's moderates, who are far from rushing to support the amendment, saying it will leave even more people without coverage. REP. DAN DONOVAN (R), NEW YORK: It doesn't help the people I represent. One of the criticisms I had had about the Affordable Care Act was it made insurance so expensive that people who had it didn't even use it because their premiums were high, their deductibles were high, their co-payments were high. And people with preexisting conditions, you're right, we can't deny them coverage. MATTINGLY: Democrats are quickly seizing on that opposition. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: The new Trumpcare will allow states to decide whether or not insurers have to cover Americans with preexisting conditions. It is hard to come up with a crueler bill. MATTINGLY: And ramping up their efforts to slow down the process altogether, now saying they will oppose a stopgap funding measure to keep the government open if Republicans push for a health care vote between now and Saturday, President Trump's 100th day in office.

1657860,1973274,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"joining us. I'm Patrick Snell. HOWELL: The crisis in Syria, we have some breaking development to tell you about in that civil war. We are hearing from Syrian state media from ISIS's media wing and from activists, they're all saying the ancient city of Palmyra has been recaptured by ISIS. You'll remember the terror group was driven out of that UNESCO World Heritage site back in march and then this, propaganda video from ISIS purports to show its attacks this weekend. Syria news agency, SANA reports that over 4,000 militants swarmed the city from various directions. This follows Russian claims that its air strikes had helped to drive off the extremist over the weekend, but it now appears the city is once again in the hands of those terrorists. As ISIS attack in Palmyra, the Russian and Syrian assault continued in east Aleppo. Russia said now that more than 700 rebel fighters have surrendered in the last day. But similar reports have been denied by activists in the past. Activists will confirm, however, that the Syrian regime and its allies have just regained control of yet another part of Aleppo, another neighborhood the city's east has been battered with air strikes and artillery and tens of thousands of civilians have escaped. As the Syrian regime offensive continues around here, a young girl living in east Aleppo has grab the world's attention and now she's speaking out to CNN with the help of her mother, seven-year-old Bana has been tweeting about life in that city. But as the government assault continues as it intensified just in the last month, Bana's Twitter account was deactivated. She has now returned to Twitter, but the family lives in hiding. On Sunday, Bana and her family spoke exclusively to CNN's Jomana Karadsheh via Skype. And Jomana joins us now from Amman, Jordan. Jomana, it's good to know that you reconnected with this family. What did they have to say to you? JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, George, we have been in touch with the family over the past week. But Bana's mother, Fatemah, has been really worried about her family's safety. They feel that they are a target and so they really kept a low profile. But there have been so many questions about their faith, others skeptics who've raise questions about the authenticity of their Twitter account. So, on Sunday, Fatemah decided to speak to us to address these questions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BANA ALABED, SYRIAN RESIDENT: Hello, my friend. How are you? This is where Aleppo. KARADSHEH: The seven-year-old captured the world's attention, as her mother Fatemah tweeted almost daily about her Bana's life under siege in eastern Aleppo. Then this chilling tweet came last month. ""Tonight we have no house. It's bombed. I got in rubble. I saw death and I almost died."" With a photo of her child Bana covered in dust.

So dark money, right? Sounds very sexy and it is. It's -- this is money that they don't disclose who the donors are. It's secret money essentially. A lot of the critics of this kind of group say we don't know who these people are, they give unlimited donations and they're only supporting one candidate. They're really just circumventing the campaign finance limits. Special interests, parties and candidates -- they're all dumping huge amounts of money into these elections because they want their team to control the Senate on November 5. (END VIDEO CLIP) COSTELLO: Chris Frates reporting. Wall Street is putting its midterm money on the Republicans. According to a new report, a majority of political contributions from individuals and firms are going to GOP candidates. CNN's Christine Romans is here to break it all down for us. Good morning. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. Remember it was Wall Street and the investment community that basically helped elect President Barack Obama -- remember? All of their money behind that candidate. How things have changed because they are betting on the Republicans in these midterms. In fact, when you look at the individual donations of people who work in the banking and finance industry you can see 63 percent of that money is going to GOP candidates, a total of $78 million. And according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Carol, that's a record high both percentage and raw dollars for a GOP in a midterm. So two reasons here, I think, that the money is backing the GOP here. One, either fairly or unfairly, Wall Street thinks it has been blamed for too many of the problems in the economy and too harshly treated in the wake of the financial crisis. But number two, I would say, Carol, is that they're betting who they think is the winning horse and that's really putting their money where they think they're going to get more results. Three sectors we'll be watching -- financials, energy and industrials -- those are the three sectors seen benefitting the most from Republicans controlling the Senate and the House so you're seeing individuals in those sectors funneling their money toward GOP candidates -- Carol.

Bloomberg has faced days of scrutiny over a 2015 audio defending his controversial Stop and Frisk policy in very stark terms. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes, that's true. Why do we do it? Because that's where all the crime is.

Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, meanwhile, are looking to build momentum they picked up in New Hampshire by adding staff and advertising in Nevada. ROMANS: All right. Are you saving more than the average investor? New data from Fidelity shows record-high average 401(k) balances. The average now holds $112,000, up seven percent in the fourth quarter, up 17 percent from 2018. Now, for those of you out there who've had your 401(k) for 10 straight years, your average balance reaching $328,200. Fidelity says many workers are saving more. Thirty-three percent of workers upped their 401(k) contribution rates last year. Investors are the true beneficiaries of a 10-year-long stock market rally. Of course, just over half of Americans hold stocks -- millions don't. But a low jobless rate and solid stocks in an election year clearly advantage Trump. You can see this in a new Gallup poll. It found 61 percent of Americans say they are better off than they were three years ago. And, 62 percent gave the president credit for the improvement in the economy. We'll be right back.

So outrageous compared to what the rest of America bears. FERGUSON: But wait a second, Jeff - SACHS: Then they repeat it. The big hedge fund - FERGUSON: You can't believe that this is the reason why the bottom quintile of the population is in poverty and has very limited social mobility. That's nothing to do with what happens on Wall Street, as you well know. The real - the real problem that we have in this country, it seems to me, is declining social mobility, and not enough is said about that. SACHS: Well, I write a great deal about it. And the big difference of social mobility - FERGUSON: Right. And what is the principal of - SACHS: But let me just get to it - the big difference - the big difference of social mobility in this country is the lack of public financing for early childhood development, for daycare, for preschool, for early cognitive development, for nutrition programs, for decent schools, unlike all of the rest of the high-income world. We do not help the poor. And that's why our social mobility has come to the lowest level of any of the high-income countries. FERGUSON: But, Jeff - SACHS: And we are 10 or 15 percentage points lower in government revenues to help for that. And I'm asking in the book for just a few percentage points and some decency at the top that they start paying their taxes at a decent rate so that we can actually pay for preschool and pay for childcare. And that's what's - that's what low social mobility is about, Niall. FERGUSON: But when you look at the quality of public education in this country, you can't simply attribute its low quality to a lack of funding. And I think there's a legitimate argument that the biggest obstacle to social mobility in this country right now is not the fat cats of Wall Street, whom I do not rush to defend, but the teachers unions, who make it almost impossible to improve public school in cities like New York where we are today. ZAKARIA: But would you - but would you comment on Jeff's basic point which is, you know, yes, it's not true that the gap has - has been produced entirely because of government policy, but that you could use government policy and government resources to help in various ways. Education may be one part of it, child nutrition would be another part of it. You know, and that that becomes impossible because you're taxing at 14 percent and spending at 23 percent?

You slice the nation in half, you look at this massive ridge that's developed around the western U.S. while you have a drought in place around the eastern U.S. And you put this together we're talking temps almost 40 Celsius or almost 100 degrees Fahrenheit out in the west. While of course, some snow showers tapering off around the eastern corner of the U.S. And some of that cold air so far to the south that centuries' old records across northern Florida are breaking at this hour where temps down well below zero in few spots around northern Florida. But the brutality of that cold air well to the north, it does shift off, it does want to moderate back out. Look at the days' temps as we go in towards the latter portion of the weekends. Another shot of cold air tries to come back into the forecast, but still a dramatic warming in store. Washington, up to 13, New York, up to around 5 degrees, of course a couple of days ago minus 1 or so was the high temperature. And notice even in Atlanta some may be getting back into the double digits and I would not be surprise if Atlanta does not fall into the single digits for a high temperature for at least another seven or eight months. So this could be the last of the very cold temperatures in the Southern U.S. Belize City, how about some showers, Mexico City, some welcome showers in the forecast there with a high around 21 degrees, and farther towards South America Manaus coming in around 29, La Paz, 11 degrees.

What we were doing was talking with a lot of different groups and people, based on the experience that we've got in Europe, and trying to find elements that perhaps might be useful.

It considers its activities -- some of its activities to be unacceptable, and it considers it to be a destabilizing element in its own society and through the region. LAKHANI: The UAE in particular is seen as a safe haven by many in the region. The government here is keen to keep it that way. In the past year, dozens with ties to Islamist groups accused of plotting to seize power were arrested and sentenced in the UAE.

In all three, former Vice President Joe Biden is leading, 51 percent to 46 percent in Florida, 49 percent to 45 percent in Arizona, and 52 percent to 40 percent in Michigan. We should note these are polls of registered voters, not likely voters. And the margin of error is 3.8 percent. This morning, we are going to talk to leaders facing these crises from different perspectives, two members of the president's administration, the chair of the Republican Governors Association, a leading member of Congress and a potential vice presidential Biden running mate, and the mayor of one of America's largest cities. But let's begin with a member of the Coronavirus Task Force, the man leading the U.S. testing effort, Admiral Brett Giroir, also a medical doctor. Admiral Giroir, thank you so much for joining us.

823630,1097152,CNN,Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees,"(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Good evening, everyone. We are live from Louisiana on day 58 of the BP disaster. Tonight, we are coming to you from the Fort Jackson Bird Rehabilitation Center, where those oiled pelicans are brought to be cleaned. We'll show you what's happening inside later tonight. There's a lot to cover this evening, the president's face-off with BP executives and that $20 billion escrow account they have agreed to set up. But we begin with something the chairman of BP said outside the White House. Tony Hayward, the CEO of BP, was there, but he doesn't talk publicly much anymore. Instead, today, the chairman of BP, Carl- Henric Svanberg, spoke to the company, expressing sadness to the country and sorrow about what's happened and promising to meet all of what he called their legitimate responsibilities. But then he was asked a question about his impressions of the president. Listen to his response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARL-HENRIC SVANBERG, CHAIRMAN, BP: He comes across as -- he is frustrated because he cares about the small people, and we care about the small people. I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are -- are greedy companies or don't care. But that is not the case in BP. We care about the small people. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: BP cares about the small people. Now, it's entirely possible he just used the wrong word. It was probably just a mistake. Maybe he meant to say little people, though that would have been just as insulting. More likely, he wanted to say ordinary people. Now, when he said this, a lot of people around here were understandably insulted. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He's from Sweden. He's not a native English speaker. And, in fact, hours later, he issued an apology, saying he had spoken clumsily. That is certainly true. It's also true that it's become almost common to have BP put out statements apologizing for or restating their own statements. But these things happen. People misspeak. If by chance, though, the chairman of BP doesn't know this already, which I'm sure he does, we think it's worth mentioning. There aren't any small people here. In all the weeks and months that we have worked in Louisiana and in the Gulf since Katrina, we've never met any little people. In the last month here, we have met shrimpers, and oystermen, homemakers and businesspeople, people whose lives are on hold or perched on a precipice because of this disaster. We have met people who have been laid off and can't find new jobs and people who can't sleep at night because they're still waiting for checks from BP for claims they filed weeks ago. In all our time here, we have not met any small people. If I could interview Mr. Carl-Henric Svanberg, which I can't because they won't agree to come on this program, I would introduce him to some of the people we have met.",0.0731632469146342,2010-06-16

Most of the children are already in bed but these boys are (INAUDIBLE) giants. It's unbelievable. Sorry for the language. You can fine me if you want. (END VIDEO CLIP) RIDDELL: Football fans, sports fans famous athletes all over the world just couldn't help but react to this incredible performance. Three-time MBA champion LeBron James who is part owner of Liverpool, said, ""Amazing night for the Reds. Wow. #YNWA."" Liverpool have done something like this before at the Champions League final in 2005 in against AC Milan. They were played off the park in the first half; 3-0 down at halftime and they came back to win that game. So there is just an inkling, a sense that they might do it again. It seemed improbable but with Liverpool it was not impossible. What an amazing performance that was tonight. We will be talking about this game for a long, long time to come. Back to you.

Tax records obtained by ""The New York Times"" showed Donald Trump in the early '90s was less qualified to host ""The Apprentice"" and more like ""The Biggest Loser."" The documents from 1985-1994 show Mr. Trump's businesses lost nearly $1.2 billion. In 1990 and '91 his core business losses were more than double the next closest taxpayers. ""The Times"" report says that Mr. Trump paid no income tax -- CHURCH: -- for eight of those 10 years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUSANNE CRAIG, ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"": Every year that we looked at, he lost money and the losses grew as he went further into the casinos and the losses that happened there. But it's unbelievable. We would have thought at least in one of the years that we saw, maybe the year he wrote ""Art of the Deal,"" he would have made money. He didn't. He was just bleeding money every year that we looked at in his businesses. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: In certain years, Donald Trump according to your reporting lost more than nearly any other individual taxpayer in the United States, is that right? CRAIG: Yes.

But the problem is, is that the Trump team has done it in exactly the ways that everyone has said is not safe. In large indoor gatherings, nobody wearing masks. So, whatever they choose to do, I sure hope that the vice president chooses to wear a mask and that everyone around him is wearing a mask, because it is absolutely critical to protecting you and everyone else from this extremely dangerous deadly disease. So, you know, I think that they can continue, but they'll need to be very transparent and very thoughtful about how to protect him. And more importantly, potentially, how to protect everyone else, because this is -- this is what happens when you ignore the science in the middle of a pandemic. BLACKWELL: You mentioned how the campaign has happened for the president with these huge events. Let's put up the video. This is the Wednesday rally. Thousands of people together, very few masks. You know, we are focused in -- on the Rose Garden event because we know the faces and we know the names of the people who have been exposed and those who have contracted the virus. But you point out something important that there are multiples of the Rose Garden event, weekly, when the president goes out and holds these rallies, and all these people come together. It's important to point out that not just Kellyanne Conway and Tom Tillis and Mike Lee. But the people whose names we do not know, face the same exposure night after night at these rallies, and they have been for months. EL-SAYED: You're absolutely right, Victor. Right. We know the answers to the questions we're asking. How many people who may have been exposed at this Rose Garden event actually got sick? But we don't know the answers to the questions we're not yet asking. How many people at that Bedminster event got sick? How many people at the Minnesota rally got sick? And the fact is, is that we're not tracking them because people don't really pay attention to the answers of those questions. But every one of those people is as important as the president of the United States. Maybe not to the future of the country, but they are a person with loved ones, and people who care about them. And we need to be asking, what is the overall consequence of dangerous behavior in the midst of a pandemic? And I think, you know, now that we are paying attention because of the illness of the president, and of course, we wish him and his wife and everyone around him a speedy recovery. EL-SAYED: We do have to hold that team accountable to what has happened. Why he got sick, and why many people, unfortunately, are liable to have gotten sick because of these exposures.

But the Obamas have done a fabulous job. Malia, who just graduated from high school and celebrated her 18th birthday yesterday and Sasha, who has the energy and enthusiasm of a wonderful young woman. Now, I happen to think those two young women may be the most impressive accomplishment of all, of our president. And it's one of the many reasons why it means so much to me personally to have the president's support in this campaign. After all, he knows a thing or two about winning elections, take it from me. And he also knows that despite all the progress we've made under his leadership, and yes, we have. We still have a lot of work to do. President Obama's job, one that he did not ask for, but was handed to him, was to save us from a second great depression and that is exactly what he did. Actually I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for saving our economy. We've added 14 million private sector jobs. The auto industry just had its best year ever. Twenty million people now have health care. Clean energy production has soared. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. That is what leadership looks like. So our next president has a different job to do. Building on the progress that President Obama has made. We have to continue to take on deep, structural challenges that existed long before the great recession. We see it here in North Carolina and across the country. Inequality is too high, wages are too low, and it's just too hard to get ahead. We need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. So we're setting five big ambitious goals. First, under President Obama and Vice President Biden, we've had 75 straight months of job growth. I want us to see 75 more. So in my first 100 days as president, we'll make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. And when I say good-paying jobs, I mean exactly that. Donald Trump thinks wages are too high. He actually stood on the debate stage and said that and he wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage altogether. Well, I think anyone who is willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well enough to raise a family. So we're going to increase the federal minimum wage and give the middle class a raise. That's good for our families, good for our economy, and boy, is it good for our country. Now, second, we're going to make college debt-free for all and we're going to build on the president's idea to make community college free. And we're going to help millions of people struggling with existing student debt",0.0644153468071415,2016-07-05

You have to really start from scratch, finds one that work in this country and then do it. But there are people from all political stripes, who start to say 99 weeks of unemployment benefits is a very, very long time. At what point do we say that's enough. DOMINICK: Well, you mentioned Germany and they also do work sharing, which is for another segment, another show, I'd love to talk about. Listen, there's this idea that people are sitting around and not wanting to work. That idea is pervasive because we all know someone who is that person. It's anecdotal, but it is not necessarily true. As we just mentioned, people are looking for jobs. There aren't any. The fact is, how are we going to find money to pay for these retraining? Last thing I would say is, unemployment, it's insurance. It's not a benefit. You pay into it, you get it back. It's one of the most stimulative things you can do, unemployment, food stamps, it goes back into the economy. They are spending that money. ROMANS: True. The last chunk of that, though, the Federal Emergency Benefits, they are paid for by the federal government. The first part, the state stuff runs out, and then somebody has got to- DOMINICK: And the money goes right back into the economy. ROMANS: Food stamps, you are right, are very stimulative.

CRUICKSHANK: A lot of people are saying maybe this was an intelligence -- you have an attack, it's an intelligence failure but European security agencies completely overwhelmed right now. The numbers are staggering, 6,000 European nationals have traveled to Syria and Iraq. And 1,500 is the number they know about and they don't have the resources, apart from a very few in Europe here right now, 24/7. The worry is the attacks moving toward terrorism. GORANI: All right, Paul Cruickshank, we'll stay in touch with you, of course. Thanks for joining us with your expertise on this. We will be asking a lot more questions in terms of the European nature of this, Chris, because is it possible that this Belgian connection was used to sort of stay under the radar as far as French intelligence services were concerned? So many questions we don't have answers to and we will be looking at those this morning. CUOMO: This is a question for leadership, how we move forward together. That is the expectation out of a disaster that you get, a galvanized resolve to do better to fight that. We have the G-20 Summit under way today in Turkey. That had one agenda and now it is very different. We will tell you what will be on the minds of leadership, as well as new details of security measures that are being put in place here in Paris following the attack.

Where did they come from? Christiane Amanpour is on the phone right now with new information. Christiane, what do we understand? CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Well, Chris, we have new information from my source in the French Senate and also from the Ministry of Interior who is leading the investigation. What, in general, they are saying is that their worst fears are being proven by the identifying of these suicide bombers. They believe that it has been something long planned, but most ominously, that at least one of these was belonging to a network that has inserted itself into the migrants and refugees who are coming to Europe. They tell me that they have confirmed that the first suicide bomber who blew him outside the stadium on Friday night had a passport that he was given on an emergency basis when he landed at Greece on the 3rd of October. They believe it's a false passport and this man gave false information and had no papers or I.D. and part of the processing with many of these poor refugees is to give them new passport. So he had a special refugee passport which names him as Ahmed Al- Mohammed (ph), born 10th of September, 1990.",0.2604707409155262,2015-11-15

We went beyond what we were required to do. And it's demeaning to law enforcement to assume they're looking out there to violate people's rights. We have internal affairs. We investigate bad policing. But don't start to demean a law that is enforcement of law. It has been the law for 50 years. Arizona is going to enforce it. You know, let's talk about the real damage, $2.7 billion dollars in Arizona to educate, medicate and incarcerate illegal aliens, Rob Krentz, a rancher on the border, during the debate of 1070, 12 police officers just in the city of Phoenix murdered and maimed by illegal aliens. Apparently, that's collateral damage to the open-border anarchists that don't want our laws enforced. SHARPTON: No, I think all of that is horrific.

SHARPTON: No one wants to see law enforcement killed, or, for that matter, young teenagers killed at the Mexican border that happen to be Mexican. We don't want to see anyone killed.

We can have different opinions, but we can't have different facts. The fact is, immigration is under the domain of the federal government. You can't have Arizona say, well, we can look at -- for certain things here if there's some illegal contact. Then, in Florida, they will say, oh, if you look like you might be from Cuba. Or, in Brooklyn, New York, they will say, you may look Haitian. (CROSSTALK) SHARPTON: We cannot have this kind of thing. And, by the way, I'm a minister and head of the National Action Network. I'm not a member of Congress. Again, we can't have different facts, Senator.

BARNETT: Isa, we should note, while you are speaking we are look at live pictures of folks in Greece lined up. Today, the scene is more patient than yesterday. They are patiently waiting to access banks. We know these capital controls are in place until Sunday's referendum. Are Greeks under the impression they will have the restrictions after the referendum? What comes after Sunday? SOARES: I think that is the problem. Many are nervous. Someone was saying, what are Greeks doing with their money? I think the majority of them are taking them out and saving it, really and trying to prepare for what may come because like you said they just don't know. Especially in light that the ECB, the European Central Bank, said they are not going to raise the ELA, and they have been throwing money into the Greek banking system. But they said yesterday they are going to keep the level as it is. They won't raise it until after the referendum and that raises a lot of questions. Another important point that any deal that is done coming from Europe and what we have had from the chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel she said it would have to include the IMF.

And so she was able to tout before this pretty friendly group some of the accomplishments of Democrats this Congress -- health care reform, Wall Street reform. And she got this incredible reception. But generally speaking, in western Pennsylvania and the Rust Belt, that's not the case. The economy is the issue, and so Democrats cannot campaign on those things that they spent just countless days, weeks, months spending their time on in Congress. For instance, Kathy Dahlkemper, she represents a western Pennsylvania district north of here that includes Erie. This is a district that went for John McCain in the last presidential election, went for George Bush the two before that. And it's representative of so many races like this where she is trying to urge voters, hey, have patience, we're turning things around, there's more to do, you have to give us this time. The issue, of course, Tony, is it's a very hard sell. HARRIS: Yes, Brianna. It's not just the House seats in play there in Pennsylvania. Also a Senate seat as well. Right? KEILAR: That's right. There is an open Senate seat. The Democrat in this race, Joe Sestak, a member of the House of Representatives, bumped out Arlen Specter, former Republican, now a Democrat. And so there is this open Senate seat where he's facing Republican Pat Toomey, who has been solidly up in the polls at this point. The liability for Sestak is that he has voted with President Obama, with congressional Democrats on these major Democratic objectives in the last Congress. In fact, one of the ads running here right now is a sound bite. This is an ad being run by Republicans, and it's a Sestak sound bite where he's saying, ""I would have spent a trillion dollars on the stimulus."" And as you can imagine, in an area like this, where the economy is really faltering, and people are concerned about spending, that's not something that flies very well. And there's a lot of enthusiasm on the western part of this state, where normally Sestak would pick up more towards the Philly area. HARRIS: OK. Well, let's do this -- let's swing back to Mark in Washington. Mark, if you would, broaden the discussion now a bit more to the balance of power in the Senate. PRESTON: Sure, Tony. For Republicans to take back control of the Senate majority, they need to pick up 10 Senate seats.

Fred, good morning. FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks again, Miles. Police in Cairo have apparently detained an Egyptian biochemist sought in connection with the London terror attacks. Scotland Yard is not calling the man a suspect, only saying that he was wanted for questioning. Meanwhile, officials say the bombings that killed 54 people last week may be linked to a plot foiled by British police last year. More clashes between Israelis and the Palestinians this morning. Palestinian security officials say an Israeli helicopter missiles were fired into the West Bank, killing least two militants. No word yet from the Israeli military. The strike comes just hours after Palestinian leaders declared a state of emergency in Gaza. Tensions there have been on the rise in the aftermath of a Palestinian attack that killed an Israeli woman. The violence comes ahead of Israel's planned withdraw from parts of Gaza.

Back in the summer, Anglo Irish was not even included in those banks being tested by the authorities. It wasn't big enough. So now, for the finance minister to publicly admit that its failure would jeopardize the Irish economy, ha, that was breathtaking. We always knew the results of the stress tests were a bit suspect across certain countries and banks, but, really, the fact that Anglo Irish nearly took down the economy makes a nonsense of some of those tests. The fear must be there are other financial land mines waiting, ticking and waiting to blow up. And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in London.

The fight to keep it secret seems to be almost over. The lawyer/boyfriend of Anna Nicole today dropped his appeal over the DNA test, that after a three-judge Bahamian panel throws cold water on Howard K. Stern`s motion to block the DNA results.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is it the end of the road, then, for Howard Stern (INAUDIBLE) defeat in this paternity suit? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today was major setback for the Stern camp. His attorney, Mr. Gomez (ph), seemed to do a lot of tap-dancing today in front of these three judges. They beat up on him pretty good and basically said something to him, basically, to the effect of they were even perplexed by the application of this appeal. And they said that he put the cart before the horse. So he basically didn`t have much to say. The judges did most of the talking.

(END VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA: And that was Dr. Robert Bennett and myself outside Charity Hospital just three days into the post Katrina flooding that surrounded that hospital. Charity was known as one of the best trauma centers anywhere in the country. Now its doors are closed. The medical staff that once worked there have been displaced. And the community it served are at a loss as to where to go, but Dr. Bennett has stayed. And he's a chief resident in emergency medicine at Charity. Dr. Bennett, thanks so much. Good to see you again. BENNETT: It's great to see you. GUPTA: Thank you. You know, let's talk about your patients. So many of the patients at Charity -- this is really striking -- are the underserved. They didn't have insurance. So they were hard to take care of in the first place. Where are they going now? BENNETT: Well, right now, you know for their acute care, they have to go to basically any emergency department in the city, all of which are essentially full right now. And you know, depending on how bad their condition is, you know, they have to be seen in the emergency department. But if you're not acutely ill and, you know, in need of treatment right then, right there, you know, our resources are very thin as far as primary care, preventative care, and just making sure that, you know, the people in New Orleans, you know, who don't have insurance are trying to stay healthy. GUPTA: You know, it's sort of striking. And I'm sure you've been following the news, as have I, with Ernesto. You know, let's say that was a hurricane that did affect New Orleans again, and you had a massive storm and the massive casualties and injuries that come along with that. How would New Orleans fare from your perspective? BENNETT: Well, that's difficult to imagine. You know, we have even less resources than we had this time ayear ago. So I mean, preparing for that number of casualties, you know, we definitely - we simply - we don't have the resources for something, you know, on that scale. GUPTA: You know, you walk around the city, Dr. Bennett. You see businesses, you see hotels reopening. Why not hospitals? I mean, you helped fix up the existing emergency room at Charity? Why didn't people move back into that hospital? BENNETT: Well, there are trains of thought, basically, on Charity. One camp has deemed the hospital, you know, unsalvageable. It can't be used in any capacity. And there's another camp who, you know, thinks that while we're waiting for something in the interim, that, you know, building, you know, it's before it to go completely unused, is, you know, it's hard to imagine. There's got to be some kind of use for it. GUPTA: This is very controversial point, as I have found in my visits down to New Orleans. Where",0.0216432997690005,2006-09-02

So there was evidence of at least one impact site to the head, other than any of the other injuries that related to the knife, the stabbing and the cutting injuries. So that is certainly one of the possibilities as to the scenario of, How do you kill two people without one of them overcoming you? Of course, you also have the other phenomenon that the assailant could be larger and heavier and stronger and faster, and he can overcome a woman and one man. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The scenario he describes is one where he goes over to Nicole`s house, only to scare her, he writes. Once he gets there, he says Ron Goldman comes through the gate, and O.J. is standing there with his accomplice. And the accomplice is holding the knife. O.J. writes that he got angry at Goldman, and thought Goldman was having an affair with Nicole. And basically then talks about how the rest is a blur. (END VIDEO CLIP) VELEZ-MITCHELL: I`m Jane Velez-Mitchell in for Nancy Grace. O.J. Simpson`s highly criticized book, ""If I Did It,"" was never supposed to see the light of day. But ""Newsweek"" says it got a hold of the bombshell passages that talk about this confrontation between Simpson, Nicole and Ron Goldman, where Simpson accuses Ron of planning a sexual encounter with Nicole. Then Nicole`s dog comes out and greets Ron. Then Simpson screams, ""You`ve been here before."" Nicole comes at Simpson and falls, cracking her head. Ron goes into a karate stance, and then Simpson allegedly writes, quote, ""Something went horribly wrong. And I know what happened, but I can`t tell you exactly how,"" end quote. And when he comes out of his daze, he`s covered in blood and holding a bloody knife. At least this is what ""Newsweek"" says is in the book, which is supposed to be hypothetical. Let`s go to the lawyers for a face-off on whether or not this is, in fact, a confession. On one side, we`ve got Alan Ripka, defense attorney, and on the other, Danielle Caminti-Aidalla, former King`s County assistant D.A. Danielle, let`s start with you: Is it a confession? DANIELLE CAMINTI-AIDALLA, FORMER ASST. DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Absolutely it`s not a confession. If it was a confession, he wouldn`t have come so close to the line without crossing it. He would have given every explicit detail about how he did it. Again, it`s O.J. thumbing his nose at the legal system. He is untouchable. He beat the criminal charges and, again, he`s trying to avoid paying any money to the Goldman families. VELEZ-MITCHELL: Well, Alan Ripka, are we going to have a face-off, or do you also feel this is not a confession? ALAN RIPKA, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: We are going to have a face-off.

Because that defendant woke up his cousin in the middle of the night, after he and his father committed the murder, and asked her to help him get rid of a bloody bat and clothes. And she did. (END VIDEO CLIP) VELEZ-MITCHELL: All right. And we are here exclusively with Leeda Zwicker, the grandmother of the victim, as well as Tara Zwicker, the aunt of the victim. Now, supposedly, this woman, who said that the young defendant, Josh Young, woke her up in the middle of the night and said, ""Hey, help me get rid of a bloody bat and clothes."" Her name is Cassie. And she`s supposedly having a sexual relationship at some point in time with the father who`s already pleaded guilty to the killing. Do you know anything about this family dynamic? And she`s a cousin. Do you know anything about this family dynamic? L. ZWICKER: Are you speaking to us? VELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes, exactly. Leeda, I`m sorry. Do you know anything about the family dynamic? L. ZWICKER: I don`t know anything about that at all. The only time we heard Cassie`s name is when -- after the fact that Trey was gone and the story came out that Josh Young ran to her back door, screaming and hollering let him in. He had just killed Trey with a bat, and he needed help. VELEZ-MITCHELL: Why was this sick family dynamic allowed to go on? Given that this ex-con was in charge of these two boys. I mean, obviously, nobody knows what`s happening inside a family, but this guy had a record. Did anybody from your side of the family try to get this -- get Trey out of there? We knew that Gouker had had a record once he had gotten out. From my understanding, it was -- he had strangled a guy with a belt and left him in a vegetarian [SIC] state, but I`m not sure that`s exactly the facts on that -- just what I`ve heard. But Trey`s dad, Terry Jr., he stayed up on all of that, and he had Trey every other week, and he talked to Trey, and he had Trey. And Trey assured him that he was fine, and that he was, you know, wanted to be there to make sure everything was ok with his younger sister, McKenzie.

But you know children don't eat on promises. We need action. You're going to pay for it one way or the other? Why not do it right. It's a lot cheaper do it right. ANDERSON: You have for months and months, if not years been warning that the climate crisis is fueling a food crisis. And you say COVID has only exacerbated that. You have learned about this for years. You've told me again and again, large swathes of the globe, from Madagascar to Honduras, to Bangladesh, and the list goes on are in the throes of a climate crisis that is now a daily reality for people on the ground. What's your message to leaders gathered next week at COP26 in Glasgow? BEASLEY: We see what's happening droughts and flooding and more cyclones, and the list goes on. So last year, we had 30 million people displaced because of climate. But in the next 30 years, with the climate expectations that we're looking at, we're looking between 201 billion people being displaced. Now, you think you got a problem with 30 million, wait till 200 to a billion people start heading your way, because they don't have food. And let me tell you, Becky, we survey people over time; they don't leave home because they just want to leave home. People don't not migrate lists; they just happen by and large, they want to stay home. But if they don't have food at 80 degree of peace and security, they go do it every mom and dad would do for their children, they go leave, they go find it. That's what happened. And let's say Germany, I just saw a report in Germany $125 billion in five years for a million refugees. Do the math, that's $25,000 per person per year, you know how much we can support that Syrian refugee in Damascus? 50 cents a day, instead of 50 to 100 euros a day, it's a lot cheaper to do it right? It's a lot more effective and better for everybody. So all hands on deck, the world's leaders coming together at COP, they need to stand up, step up, and don't just talk about it, do something about it. We've got solutions, we need to be given the funds and the flexibility to do it and do it now. ANDERSON: So you have been calling on a smallish cohort of individuals that you say, can help end this crisis. U.S. billionaires alone, have gotten over a trillion dollars richer during the Pandemic. You're asking those billionaires who are going to space, the likes of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to help. Are they helping? BEASLEY: The governments are tapped out.

BRENT BOZELL, PARENTS TELEVISION COUNCIL: When you see these reality shows interspersed with drama and comedy shows, you tend to blur it all into one thing. And people tend to forget these are real people doing real things and, in many cases, with real consequences to their lives. SYLVESTER: Shows like ""The Swan"" have been criticized for glorifying plastic surgery, ""Fear Factor"" for putting contestants in humiliating situations; and ""Wife Swap,"" where wives leave their homes to live with other families. It raises the question, what does it say about our culture that shows that appeal to the lowest common denominator are so popular? ADAM THIERER, CATO INSTITUTE: There's always been a chicken and egg question with broadcast television programming and content, which is that did broadcast TV drag us down into the moral swamp or did culture generally decline, or whatever else? The question really is difficult to answer. SYLVESTER: Mark Burnett, creator of ""Survivor"" and ""The Apprentice,"" says there is good and bad reality TV. But the reality is unscripted TV is here to stay. MARK BURNETT, TELEVISION PRODUCER: Asking me when people are going to tire of reality is a silly question. It's like asking me when are they going to get tired of drama or comedy. SYLVESTER: Network broadcasters and free speech advocates say if someone doesn't like what they see, they can always change the channel. But parents' groups say they shouldn't have to, since the broadcasters are using airwaves owned by the public.

President Biden once again calling on cities, states, local courts, landlords, and cabinet agencies to prevent evictions.

BROWN: And to even have the prime minister speaking out about it. T. BROWN: It's really explosive. And one of the reasons it's explosive is because the whole issue of sort of racism in the armed forces in England is a very tender one. There's only 250 Muslims in the entire 1,800 British armed forces across the board, which is a tiny number. And there's recently been in the UK a real kind of recruiting drive to try to get Muslims to sign off and join the forces. But, of course, you know, with the feelings about the Iraq and Afghanistan, it's very hard to recruit them. So this is not exactly good news for them.

WHITFIELD: So one woman was, who was being held against her will, was freed and then the other woman, we believe, that has been captured, is Abu Sayyaf's wife. What kind of role might she play in the whole structure of ISIS? What kind of information would they be able to get out of her? WALSH: One of the more confusing things about the White House's version of events here is the notion that Umm Sayyaf -- and that is not her real name. That means the mother of Sayyaf. So Abu Sayyaf and Umm Sayyaf are the mother and father of a child called Sayyaf -- we know that. That she was actually, intricately involved in human trafficking in ISIS' day-to-day operations. That's entirely feasible, but it's rare. We don't normally see ISIS using women in their leadership. They don't seem to have that often a role in the day-to- day operations. Women in the vision that ISIS have for society take a secondary role certainly and there are women who support them on social media, who travel to Iraq and Syria, to be with them, to be in the kind of society they espouse. But unlike, for example, the Syrian Kurds where the women fight alongside the men, it's a very much more chauvinistic society, I think it's fair. It would be strange if Umm Sayyaf was integral to ISIS' day to day operation. Not impossible and maybe the U.S. had very clear intelligence to that effect but it does potentially give rise to the notion that her capture was a lucky side effect for the U.S. of this raid rather than something they were planning on in the first place.

But they're warning the suspect may be monitoring law enforcement efforts on social media platforms and he could be dangerous. BERMAN: All right, we will keep our eye on that story all morning long. In the meantime, the coronavirus pandemic could have a major impact on your credit score. Joining us now is Jean Chatzky. She's a personal finance journalist and the CEO of HerMoney.com. Jean, great to have you here. Look, you always have to watch your credit score now. But it might be particularly important during this pandemic. So let me give you some questions from our viewers here. Number one, why is trying to keep your credit score so important right now? JEAN CHATZKY, CEO, HERMONEY.COM: Credit is one of those interesting things that you need to go on the offensive about. When you're trying to get additional credit, it doesn't work if you've lost a job or you've gotten yourself into a difficult situation, you're better off just protecting it up front. And right now we've seen a lot of scam artists in the water. So we want to make sure that we are making sure that they are taking care of handling your situation well. BERMAN: One of the things we're seeing is that some consumers are having their credit limits slashed. Why is that? CHATZKY: Yes. A survey from the folks at Compare Cards found that about 25 percent of people are seeing their credit limits slashed. And it's because the credit card companies are worried that you're not going to have the money to prioritize their bills. If this should happen to you, pick up the phone, call the card company, ask them to reinstate the credit that they took away from you. But it's also happening most on cards that we are seeing people are not using. So if you've got a card that has just been sitting in a drawer, but you want to maintain that credit, just put one bill on it a month, put a subscription on it, pay that automatically, and then it's taken care of. BERMAN: Can you cancel that card if you don't ever use it? CHATZKY: You can, but you shouldn't from the purpose of your credit score. Having credit that you're not using actually keeps your score up. So it's not something that you want to do, particularly right now when the card companies are shutting down limits on people who haven't asked",0.357137113218493,2020-05-26

Now, one of the key Palestinians demands going into this summit was that Israel remove its tanks, heavy weapons, and military positions from blockading Palestinian towns and cities on the West Bank and Gaza. We heard, before he left here, the Israeli prime minister say that he would wait 48 hours to see what the situation was on the ground before moving back those military positions -- Daryn, Bill. HEMMER: All right, Christiane Amanpour, live in Sharm el-Sheikh. DARYN KAGAN, CNN ANCHOR: And this diplomatic news might have its greatest impact felt in Jerusalem, the epicenter of the escalating tensions. Our Jerrold Kessel is standing by with the latest from Jerusalem -- Jerrold. JERROLD KESSEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Daryn, no sooner had that agreement been concluded, sort of agreement, the statement read out by President Clinton committing the two sides to the cessation of violence and the other elements in this package that was agreed upon at Sharm el-Sheikh. All sides were saying it all depends on what happens on the ground. Here is Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Israeli Prime Minister Barak's reading on that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EHUD BARAK, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The test will lie in the implementation, and I suggest to everyone, including the correspondents, that you look less at gestures and more at action actually on the ground. Everything will be examined according to how it is implemented, both in terms of what the Palestinians do and evaluate also as far as our own action. (END VIDEO CLIP) KESSEL: We have seen some movement on the ground in the sense we did see -- our cameras caught one Israeli tank, outside the town of Ramallah on the West Bank pulling back and going back into a base nearby. That could be perhaps part of this agreement, perhaps it is too early to tell whether it is part of that. But beyond that, there have been clashes breaking out in various points there in that town of Ramallah on the West Bank, in Bethlehem, where there was the funeral of a 15-year-old Palestinian who was killed yesterday, and pertinently on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem, where there was an exchange of fire, Israelis saying fired from the Palestinian town of Beit Jala on the West Bank into an Israeli neighborhood of Jerusalem. And an Israeli border policeman was very critically injured in that fire. Israeli tanks, which had been stationed there, said to have opened fire with their machine guns back into the sources of the fire, so say the Israelis, in that Palestinian town. So these clashes evolving and, in the town of Ramallah on the West Bank, a rally shortly after the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement came out, of supporters of Yasser Arafat's movement, that's the leading movement within the PLO Fatah organization.

The firm said the State Department convoy it was protecting was in danger and that it had come under attack in the central Baghdad square, something eyewitnesses interviewed by CNN at the time said wasn't true. The Iraqi government called the shootings unprovoked and premeditated murder. KARADSHEH (on camera): The incident sparked a diplomatic crisis and was a turning point in US-Iraqi relations. It also changed the rules on the ground for security contractors who now operate with no immunity and under strict Iraqi regulations. KARADSHEH (voice-over): For survivors like lawyer Hasan Jaber Salman, the physical wounds may have healed, but the memories haunt him, he says. HASAN JABER SALMAN, LAWYER (through translator): No matter how you try to describe this, you can't do it justice. They killed 17 people in cold blood. Families have lost a father, a son, a child. It's a tragedy I cannot describe. KARADSHEH: Salman was driving to work when he got trapped in the traffic in Nisour Square. When the shooting started, like many others, he tried to flee. He was shot three times. SALMAN (through translator): It was horror. People were terrified. People running out of their cars were being shot at. Anything that moved in Nisour Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot at everyone. KARADSHEH: After years of a lengthy and bumpy legal process, a US jury will now decide whether four guards involved in the shootings are guilty of more than a dozen counts of murder or manslaughter and other charges. The defendants say they acted in self-defense. Salman, who recently returned from testifying in the US, says he has faith in America's justice system. SALMAN (through translator): I felt that there are people who care about this case. I felt the US judiciary was interested, even if it's to show the media that America is just and guarantees people's rights. I have trust that there will be justice. KARADSHEH: For the families of the victims, the long wait for justice will not bring back their loved ones, but may finally mean closure. (END VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH: For most Iraqis, Becky, what happened in Nisour Square is a distant memory, especially with what's going on in the country right now. But for the families of the victims and the survivors, it's been seven years of wait -- a long wait for justice that they're still waiting for right now.

2138496,2456417,CNN,New Day,"conference last night. And as you point out, I guess this information was known before the news conference. We didn't know it at the time. And there were a lot of questions that were asked about community spread. Is this going to happen? We've been hearing from the CDC. It's not a question of if. It's a question of when. But then you just heard, you played that little clip from the president saying this isn't inevitable, this is going to happen, and he kind of knew it already at the time. So this is the concern. When a virus is sort of out there now in the environment, people potentially becoming exposed to it despite having had no travel to one of these areas where the virus is known to be circulating, despite having no known contact with someone who's infected with the virus. That is the definition of community spread. And I think that's what public health officials will pay attention to this. BERMAN: Dr. Emanuel, I guess, I want your take on this breaking news overnight, this patient in Northern California, but I also want your reaction to that news conference, the announcement from the White House overnight. DR. ZEKE EMANUAL, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think, first of all, to have an effective public health response, the public has to trust the government that they're getting the right information and that the instructions they're getting from the government are accurate. And when you have this dissidence between what President Trump says, what the public health officials at the CDC and NIH say, and then this episode which they knew about before the press conference, public trust goes down. I think you're going to see this reflected in many, many outcomes. And maybe the one that will get the president's attention will be the stock market. Maybe we can't trust what comes out of the president and the White House's mouth. That will be a very dangerous moment. And I think that was a very bad judgment on their part to withhold information from the public, which is inevitably going to come out. Facts do overwhelm the P.R. that you might want to put on them. And I think the facts in this public health case are going to be very stubborn. I do think this is a turning point, as your reporter mentioned and Sanjay mentioned. We have community acquired spread. That means there are other people out there who have the virus. But, remember, most people are going to be asymptomatic and going to have this virus and not know that they're sick. We see this from the cruise ship too. I also want to note that, you know, having Vice President Pence in charge, having Alex Azar still head of the task force, it's confusing to me what actually is going on in the White House and who's responsible. I would just remind your audience when H1N1 happened in 2009-2010, at the White House, we",0.0592717933947772,2020-02-27

The periodic table, or as I like to think of it, the ingredients of everything. Rare elements are -- actually rare earths are 17 elements. If you take a look, we have them all here. They're absolutely vital to just about any high-tech device that we couldn't live without. That's the science. All right, now here is the news. More than 95 percent of these elements come from China. More than 95 percent. China has only 36 percent of the world's known reserves, but no other country can produce them on a scale that even comes close. And Beijing's been tightening rare earth exports for years. Just last week, it announced a total shutdown at three major mines. The U.S., Japan, the World Trade Organization all are pushing to keep the supply lines open. And rare earth mines in the west, which are rarer than rare, are scrambling to produce even more and to find more reserves. Here's one place that looks promising. Afghanistan, believe it or not. As far back as 2007, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated more than a million metric tons of rare earth were buried under Helmand province. The Afghans say that they're worth $3 trillion.

If someone has a problem with the truth most of the time you don't really believe what they are saying. They are discredited. Discounted.

430729,657507,CNN,The Situation Room,"edition of THE SITUATION ROOM, ""#1 Issue: Iraq."" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Welcome back to our special election edition of THE SITUATION ROOM -- the number-one issue in this election, at least right now, Iraq. Tonight, a turning point in the rebuilding of Iraq -- the engineering and construction firm Bechtel is pulling out of the country. Bechtel completed its government contract this week, after spending three years in Iraq, and netting more than $2 billion in federal contracts. The work may have been profitable, but it was also very dangerous. Like so many other contractors in Iraq, Bechtel has seen quite a few of its construction projects sabotaged by insurgents and terrorists, or simply crippled by lack of security. And 52 -- 52 -- Bechtel employees, mostly Iraqi subcontractors, have been killed. Let's bring back our national correspondent, John Roberts. He's in Baghdad with us. People don't necessarily realize, John, how dangerous these contractors -- how dangerous this work is. ROBERTS: You know, Wolf, I have spoken several times with the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction's office. Just yesterday, I talked with -- with one of the senior officials there. And they say that overhanging all of the efforts to reconstruct the infrastructure of this country is the issue of security. And, to drive that point home, while I was interviewing this official yesterday, Wolf, mortars landed in the Green Zone, and we had to interrupt the interview. The violence continues across this country. And, specifically, these infrastructure projects are being targeted. Bechtel was unable to complete a hospital in Basra. It got delayed by a year. It was 150 percent over budget. Eventually, the U.S. military took them off of the job, because they just couldn't get it done. In other areas, we are seeing security affecting the quality of construction as well. And that also dovetails in, pairs together, Wolf, with this idea that some of these American contractors are subcontracting to the point where the work gets very shoddy as well. Remember what happened to that police college, where all of the plumbing was leaking -- so, Wolf, a lot of problems here, but overhanging everything is this issue of security. And we should mention to you, Wolf, too, before we go here, things still very dangerous in Baghdad -- just got a report of three more soldiers killed in eastern Baghdad. That would bring now to seven the total number of U.S. troops killed in the first two days of November. BLITZER: I know you are going to have a lot more on this on a special edition of ""THIS WEEK AT WAR"" this weekend, as well, John. Thank you very much. Please be careful over there -- Paula.

Negative practices by individual law enforcement officers and individual departments present a significant danger, not only to their communities, but also to committed and hardworking public safety officials around the country who perform incredibly challenging jobs with unwavering professionalism and uncommon valor. Clearly, clearly, we owe it to these brave men and women to ensure that all law enforcement officials have the tools, the training and the support they need to do their jobs with maximum safety and effectiveness. Now, over the last few months, these goals have driven President Obama and me to announce a series of administration proposals that will enable us to help heal mistrust wherever it is found, from a national initiative for building community trust and justice to a historic new Task Force on 21st Century Policing which will provide strong federal support to law enforcement at every level on a scale not seen since the Johnson administration. These aims also have led me to travel throughout the country, to Atlanta, to Cleveland, to Memphis, to Chicago, to Philadelphia, to Oakland, as well as to San Francisco, to convene a series of roundtable discussions dedicated to building trust and engagement between law enforcement, civil rights, youth and community leaders from coast to coast. As these discussions have unfolded, I have repeatedly seen that, although the concerns we are focused on today may be particularly acute in Ferguson, they're not confined to any one city, state or geographic region. They implicate questions about fairness and trust that are truly national in scope, and they point not to insurmountable divides between people of different perspectives, but to the shared values and the common desire for peace, for security, and for public safety that binds us together, binds police together, as well as protesters, although the dialogue by itself will not be sufficient to address these issues, because concrete action is what is needed now, concrete action. Initiating a broad, frank and inclusive conversation is a necessary and productive first step. In all of the Civil Rights Division's activities in Ferguson, as in every pattern or practice investigation the division has launched over the last six years, our aim is to help facilitate and inform this conversation to make certain that it leads to, again, concrete action, and to ensure that law enforcement officers in every part of the United States live up to the same high standards of professionalism. It is clear from our work throughout our -- this country, particularly through the work of our Civil Rights Division, that the prospect of police accountability and criminal justice reform is an achievable goal, one that we can reach with law enforcement and community members at the table as full partners.

KING; But Romney's point is about that this is - this incident escalates dramatically but what has been a long running bloody civil war in which Iran is with the Houthi Rebels and Yemen. But guess what; the United States is with Saudi Arabia which has been responsible for a lot of bloodshed in Yemen, using American weapons at times, which is why you see the 2020 Democrats weighing in as well.

Beto O'Rourke says pretty much the same thing as President I will not go to war for Saudi Arabia.

BENDER: I think that's right. You put all the Democratic talking points up there, but there is also a similar sentiment from the Republican majority in Congress right now, right? They are still sort of frustrated over the assassination of Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia not a lot of interest in running to help Saudi Arabia here. And they certainly don't want to go to the aide of the Houthies and instruct themselves into what a lot of Republicans in the Senate view as an Iran-Saudi battle. KING: That's a great point there are the particulars of this attack on Saudi oil installations which will get the world's attention. But then there is the history not just of the President's mixed statements or confusing statements but the fact that they have coddled the Saudis after the Khashoggi murder, and a lot of people in both parties don't have a lot of love for the Saudis at the moment if you will.

When I visit, for example, an Islamic community center, or a Somali- American community group like I did recently in Minneapolis, there are a number of issues that they want to talk about with us, in my department. Profiling at airports, for example, or enforcement administration of the immigration laws. And so we have wide ranging conversations about a number of things to build trust between community organizations and state and local federal law enforcement to do a better job of collectively protecting the homeland. As the homeland security threat evolves, collaboration with community organizations, with state and local law enforcement is becoming more and more important. This is not a job for the federal government alone. So, that is the reason that I am here today in Boston, and I will continue to do a number of these around the country.

I want to make sure that ban thing is OK. To help us sort it all out, the FDA's Dr. David Acheson joins us. Is it a ban, doctor? DR. DAVID ACHESON, ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER FOR FOOD PROTECTION, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION: It's not exactly a ban, no. What this is, is a hold at the port. LEMON: OK. ACHESON: So, if a Chinese importer of a farm-raised fish of five different types wants to import into the United States, they have to prove to us that they do not contain certain drugs that we have concern about. LEMON: OK. Let's get to the bottom line, because we hear about recalls all the time and certain things that you can't eat. What the average person wants to know is, what can I eat? What can't I eat? Should I stay away from fish? What do you tell the -- the average consumer about what you're doing today? ACHESON: The average consumer really doesn't need to be overly concerned about the fish that they currently have at home, in their fridges, in their freezers, or they may buy tonight or tomorrow. This is a -- a long-term problem that we have been monitoring for some time. We have reached the point where we now feel we need to broaden this import -- holding-import alert to countrywide with -- with China. The concern is really long-term exposure from some of the drugs that are in these -- these types of seafoods. It's not a short-term- exposure issue. You don't need to worry what's on your dinner table tonight. LEMON: I know. And I hear you saying that, but people are going to worry anyway, because we heard about -- we heard the same thing when we heard about melamine in dog food. It was only, you know, contained in certain dog foods. Then there was the toothpaste, the antifreeze in the toothpaste, and now antimicrobials in fish. Are we -- is there anything from China that we can eat? ACHESON: Yes. I mean, what -- what the Food and Drug Administration is doing, it's continuing to monitor imports from all kinds of countries, not just China. We have known about these problems with antimicrobials for some time, with antibiotics and other drugs in the seafood for some time, and have been doing something about it. We have been putting individual companies on -- on hold. What FDA does is -- is, we focus on the products that we have concern about. We do testing, and we -- and we take action.

He wrote a book in the early 2000s where he supported an assault weapon ban. He supported increasing the waiting time that people have to enter into when buying a weapon. Of course, he disavowed those views during the 2016 campaign and cast himself as a pro-gun candidate. But there was something to be said for the fact that president Trump has been all over the map which means it shouldn't be that abnormal to see him as president embrace some of those gun laws, those gun changes that would anger the NRA because he has been all over the map.

Now, the pictures 19 years later in Parkland, Florida, there you go. Can you tell which was which except by the quality of the video? Of course not. They're disturbingly familiar. The students of Stoneman Douglas grew up with the so-called Columbine effect that school shootings on a regular basis and active shooter drills to help to prepare. The survivors this time are different to any that we've seen before. This is why, one, they are older and more politically aware than the first graders whose classmates were slaughtered at Sandy Hook. Two, they're using the bullhorn of social media of which they are par excellence aficionados amplifying their calls for action. And three, they're growing up in a country where young Americans are buying fewer guns than the older generation did before them. Those factors have given the survivors high school power. One by one, they've unleashed it on lawmakers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DELANEY TARR, STONEMAN DOUGLAS SCHOOL STUDENT: This is to every lawmaker out there. No longer can you take money from the NRA.

The ruling applies to one man, but it's a blow to the administration's anti-terror strategies. We're going to bring in now CNN homeland security correspondent Jeanne Meserve. And Jeanne, please wrap this all up for us. JEANNE MESERVE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, T.J., as you say, this is a major setback for the Bush administration. A federal appeals court panel in Richmond, Virginia, ruled that a non-U.S. citizen held as an enemy combatant in the U.S. is entitled to a court hearing. The man in question, Ali al-Marri, is a citizen of Qatar, accused of being a sleeper agent for al Qaeda. He was arrested in 2001 and has been held in solitary confinement since 2003 at a military brig in South Carolina. In its ruling the appeals court panel said the government cannot subject al-Marri to indefinite military detention, for in the United States the military cannot seize and imprison civilians, let alone imprison them indefinitely. It went on to say, ""We recognize the understandable instincts of those who wish to treat domestic terrorists as combatants in the global war on terror. However, this does not permit the government to transform a civilian into an enemy combatant subject to indefinite military detention."" The ruling was 2-1. In his dissent, Judge Henry Hudson argued that, although al-Marri was not personally engaged in armed conflict with U.S. forces, he is the type of stealth warrior used by al Qaeda to perpetuate terrorist acts against the United States -- T.J. HOLMES: All right. We hear from the court there. We're hearing from the Justice Department yet? MESERVE: No reaction from the Justice Department at this point in time. The Bush administration has argued that it has the power to detain suspects in military custody, on U.S. soil, as part of the president's commander in chief authority. The Justice Department can appeal. And by the way, the ruling does not mean that al-Marri can go free -- T.J. HOLMES: All right. Jeanne Meserve with the update on this big story for us.

BLITZER: Yes, Democrats I know the Hillary Clinton campaign got taken very, very seriously right now. Anderson, over to you. COOPER: As they should, as any candidate should. David Axelrod, how does the race change for Donald Trump when he wakes up tomorrow, how does it change? He's no longer competing against the man he called ""lying Ted"" all this time.

And I think that that is a wrong calculation. I think that she is likely to pick up as many as she loses because of the tradeoffs and constituencies here. So, I think they have to focus on those states. The Clinton campaign has to focus on those states for the reasons that Van has been talking about.

So, yeah, look, I think today obviously was a very important day because I'm sure a lot of what he's saying certainly is being backed up by what he wheeled in to the members of Congress to see. The thing is politically, yes, perhaps, this is going to be a problem for the president and for his family. The other thing is whether or not this is actually there is some kind of criminal violation in the end in all of this. All of that is still really unclear. BURNETT: Right. We don't know. We don't know what other party Southern District may have done with that information. I do love that detail, Shimon, rolling around suitcases full of documents.

If this were a corporation and we were on the outside looking in and we saw this kind of turnover, we would say something is deeply wrong with this place.

Some international headlines. A militant Islamist group is blamed for triggering a three-day spate of violence in Nigeria. Officials say the group is specifically targeting Christians in a series of attacks. It's the same group that claims responsibility for attacking churches in Nigeria on Christmas day. And animal rescuers in New Zealand managed to drag 18 pilot whales back into the ocean that have mysteriously beached themselves on the South island. Seven whales died because they spent too much time in shallow water. At last check, the rescued whales were well offshore. The trial of Joran Van Der Sloot will continue in a few days. The main suspect in the disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway faces murder charges but it's got nothing to do with Aruba and Natalee Holloway. CNN's senior Latin America Affairs editor Rafael Romo explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICA AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice-over): Joran Van Der Sloot had spent the past 18 months as an inmate at the Castro Castro Prison in Peru's capital city of Lima. Some inmates see the 24-year-old Dutchman as a celebrity. WALTER RAMOS, PRISON INMATE: He's one of us. (INAUDIBLE) It has nothing to do with us. We don't have nothing against him. ROMO: After his arrest in Chile in June of 2010, he was sent back to Peru and taken to the Lima prison to await trial in the robbery and beating death of 21-year-old Stephany Flores. This surveillance video shows Flores and Van Der Sloot playing poker at a local casino. Another video shows the couple entering Van Der Sloot's hotel where the victim's lifeless body was later found. She had suffered multiple injuries, a broken neck and was covered in blood. The killing happened on May 30th, 2010, exactly five years after Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway disappeared in Aruba after spending time with Van Der Sloot. Though arrested as a suspect in Holloway's death, Van Der Sloot then 17 was never charged due to a lack of evidence. In Peru, Van Der Sloot initially confessed to killing Flores. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): So it is true, and I'm going to ask you this, and you can say yes or no, did you kill Stephany Tatiana? JORAN VAN DER SLOOT, DEFENDANT: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): You killed Stephany Tatiana Flores, right? VAN DER SLOOT: Yes. ROMO: But Van Der Sloot later recanted. His attorney say he was not given a translator during his interrogation. Peruvian authorities say they have done everything according to law. COL. MIGUEL ANGEL CANLLA ORE, PERUVIAN NATIONAL POLICE (through translator): The statement given by the Dutch citizen where he declares himself convicted and confesses his crime was done according to the formalities of the law.

As a matter of fact, this is Tariq Aziz, who is an Iraqi official that we have become quite familiar with over the years. We have seen him speak out for the government in various positions of late. DARYN KAGAN, CNN ANCHOR: He was the foreign minister during the war. This, once again, being the 10th anniversary of the beginning of that war, let's go ahead and listen in. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) TARIQ AZIZ, IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (through translator): During that time, as we all remember, there was a lot of talk about what was called Iraq's attack on Kuwait and what was called the international community's will to remove the Iraqi forces from Iraq. That was the portrait of events as was shown that time. And despite our will to explain the reality, but lies and disinformation and foreign news medias and especially the American ones and some of the Arab media, unfortunately the lies and disinformation was wide-scale, to the extent that so many people believed what was said by those media organizations. But during the last 10 years, many real events have unfolded. They do not concern Iraq alone, but they're also important to the Arabs and to the whole world. ""Why?"" was their question. There are facts -- I have to remind you with. After the aggression, days after the aggression started, the American defense minister at that time and the president -- deputy president-elect -- was in the Pentagon. One of the journalists asked him a question: ""Are you sure of winning this war against Iraq?"" He said: ""Yes, we are sure because we have been preparing for this war for more than a year."" That time was said in January, 1991. The Iraqi forces entered Kuwait on the 2nd of August in '90. A year before January, '91, means January, 1990. And if you go back to the press archive, you will see that Norman Schwarzkopf was in Kuwait in 1989. And Schwarzkopf was the head of the force special in dealing with crisis in the Gulf, which was established during Carter's administration. HARRIS: We are listening to comments this morning of Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who basically has had that position since the war, which was 10 years ago -- began 10 years ago tonight as a matter of fact.

2244253,2563865,CNN,Connect The World,"with this Biden naming long time aide Ron Klain as his White House Chief of Staff Klain serving that role for Biden when Biden was Vice- President and also coordinating the Obama Administration's response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Well, in this story on cnt.com today, White House Reporter Stephen Collinson good friend of the show describes what he calls a staggering and surreal failure of the leadership at the White House joining me now. There is - it does seem remarkable, watching it from the outside looking in, Biden blocked from receiving messages from world leaders and the things go on and on. I can see how this reflects on the states from the outside looking in. I wonder how it feels to be within, looking in, as it were. STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: It looks like a really strange but not altogether unexpected sequel to the Trump era. I don't think anybody thought that the president would go quietly if he lost. He told us that the election in his view was rigged before we even had it. So I don't think really, to be honest, anything, even though it is exceedingly unusual in U.S. history that a beaten president does not concede, having watched the president for four years and the way he's behaved, it is serious but it's not altogether unexpected. ANDERSON: Let's talk about the election an election that President Trump will not concede. The State of Georgia has announced that it will recount its ballots by hand. What does this actually mean? And how long will it take at this point? COLLINSON: Well, the Republican authorities who are running this election in Georgia say that they think they can get this done by November 20th, which is the preset date for the election to be certified. So what they're going to do? They're going to start right at the beginning and they're going to hand-count all of these ballots. That was actually mandated under law that there would be a recount because the election was so close. Having said that, Joe Biden is 14,000 votes ahead of President Trump with 99 percent of the ballots cast counted the first time. There's not really any precedent in recent American history for an election or candidate who trails by that margin to overturn this vote. So it still looks very likely that Joe Biden will win Georgia thus closing off mathematically the president's path to the White House. So, while the Trump Campaign is very excited that this recount is taking place, I think it's more of a political situation rather than from any real belief that this is going to change the course of the election. ANDERSON: It is clear that a Biden Administration is going to take what is happening with regard to Coronavirus in America very, very seriously 143,000 cases of COVID today alone in the U.S. a Biden aide Stephen, recommending a four to six-week national lockdown.

And you bet we're going to question them. And, by the way, we have gotten information from these high value detainees that have helped protect you. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: Columnist Joe Klein is here from ""Time"" magazine and his views differ, shall we say, sharply from the president's and the appearance of this ""Time"" magazine. You say, Joe, in the article, you describe his presidency as a national embarrassment. Those are harsh words. JOE KLEIN, ""TIME"" MAGAZINE: It has been an international embarrassment. I mean, the day that the Abu Ghraib pictures appeared in the press, I was in Jordan and I was interviewing a moderate Jordanian businessman who said, ""you guys are going to lecture us now on human rights? You're going to tell us how to live our lives?"" This has done tremendous damage to the United States and the world and, it, most likely, is illegal. We're signatories to the Geneva Accords. These policies were a clear violation of how you treat prisoners. ROBERTS: Now you point to the 2002 finding where the president said that the Geneva Convention does not apply to - the Geneva Convention standards do not apply to these detainees. The president, the Vice-President Cheney have insisted that the U.S. does not engaged in torture, does not engage in torture, does use enhance interrogation techniques like waterboarding.

And so I'm not sure how enlightening that would have been to anybody involved and I think when we really look at the bottom line here, I mean, you know, Jeff's point is a good one, right? It's a -- it's a tough question, but the FEC has -- in its regulations, has said it has to be an obligation that arises from the campaign. If it would have existed anyway, it's not a campaign expenditure and they specifically rejected the mixed use idea, that if it primarily benefits the campaign, but also benefits the candidate personally, it counts. So I think that's a real problem. SMERCONISH: Hey, Jeff, it occurs to me that perhaps from a legal standpoint, the President might benefit from evidence that he had similarly acted and paid other women to go away long before he was a presidential candidate thereby strengthening his case this had nothing to do with the 2016 election. This is my MO to protect my brand. TSAI: You know, it kind of highlights, Michael, what I think is some of the uniqueness of the situation here is that some of that evidence might, in fact, go to help establish that point, but perhaps go to reinforce other issues, which is to say that putting aside whether there was an MO there, that there was a real motivation in this particular situation, that the revelation of some of those things might serve to hurt the campaign. And so to the extent that prosecutors are even looking at cases beyond what they've already done -- that's ""AMI"" and Mr. Pecker and Mr. Cohen -- I think one of the things they'll look at are some of those factual issues and with the timing of these things and the manner in which it happened before and how all of it mixes together here. SMERCONISH: Hey, Bradley, as a practical matter, if you are right -- I mean, look, you were the Chair of the Federal Election Commission and you think that Michael Cohen pled guilty to something not a crime. Why is a practical matter would he have then pled guilty? Because by all accounts, he had great legal counsel and himself is a lawyer. SMITH: Well, that may be a question for Michael Cohen and maybe a better question for Jeff, but, you know, obviously people sometimes will cop pleas because they're going to get a better deal. He was facing a lot of potential jail time for other charges -- tax fraud and various other things. It may be that the U.S. Attorney was, of course, interested in getting at Trump and it's not like the U.S. Attorney's theory here is made out of, you know, nothing.

Because they are larger, can we jump to the conclusion that fewer make it into the upper atmosphere, and is that good news for air travel? PHILLIPS: In general, it is good news for air travel. So, I think that the particles that make it into the atmosphere will stay -- will remain in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time. It's hard to say at this stage whether we're looking at the same -- roughly the same total mass of ash being ejected into the atmosphere. I think probably not. The eruptions of Grimsvotn tend to be much shorter. So, it last erupted explosively in 2004, and before that in 1998. And there, those eruptions were -- lasted typically a few days to a week. So, I don't think we're looking at the very extensive activity that we saw in April last year. STOUT: OK, so you're predicting that this eruption of Grimsvotn will be no more than a week? Just want to confirm that. PHILLIPS: Yes, based -- well, based on previous historical evidence. Obviously, we can't predict anything for sure with natural systems as complicated as volcanoes. But if we look at the previous patterns of activity, we've seen that the eruptions tend to be somewhat more explosive but someone shorter lasting than events of last year.

The smoke and the flashes you see, they come from near Libya leader Moammar Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound. And although the explosions were heard and felt well beyond the area, NATO officials later said that its specific target was a vehicle storage facility used by Gadhafi's forces. The Libyan government has a different version of events. It says that the target, it was a guard compound for pro-Gadhafi military volunteers.

TAPPER: I think one of the problems is that President Bush came to Washington truly with an outsider way of looking at things, and immediately surrounded himself with a lot of people, like OMB Director Mitch Daniels and others, who really do business the way in Washington -- the way people in Washington do business, and that includes budget tricks and all sorts of chicanery and porting this tax off until this point and this. And you know, the estate tax is eliminated but then in 10 years it comes back. And those sorts of things might make Bush look like another Washington politician when in actuality he isn't one. DURKIN: Right. I would argue that if his presidency turns out to be successful, it would be precisely because he knew how to project himself as an outsider while in fact behaving as an insider. GREENFIELD: In the few minutes, seconds we have left, Sam, is there any -- we've heard a lot about bipartisanship all during the presidential run-off and in January. What's the -- what's the chances, what are the chances for bipartisanship in this fall? MACDONALD: They're all going to be claiming it. I think when they get together, I think they're all going to agree and hold hands and talk about how the military needs an extra $18 billion. But behind the scenes, it's going to be, where's that money going to come from? So it'll be bipartisanship on everybody's face, but they're going to be back-stabbing like always. GREENFIELD: OK.

The last president to win a second full term with his party in control of the Congress was Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lyndon Johnson doesn't count. He was filling out JFK's term when he ran. Think about it: Ike in '56, Nixon in '72, Reagan in '84, Clinton in '96, all won with one or both houses in opposition hands. The only president who ran for a second term with his party in full control of the Congress was Jimmy Carter in 1980. He lost in a landslide, and his party lost the Senate as well. Why?

Do you think this is something outside the ordinary? SIDNER: It really isn't outside the ordinary. You know, if you look back just a couple of months ago, there were lots of things going on, on that border, whether it was tunnels that were exploding on Israeli soldiers, whether it was -- there was a child that was shot that witnesses said shot by Israeli soldiers, there was return fire. So there have been a lot of things that have gone on, on this border, as you might imagine, with a lot of different people saying that one side is to blame or another side is to blame. But it's just the timing of all this that has people concerned, although I think as a whole even though we're hearing from the Palestinian Authority, which is saying that they believe this is breaking the cease-fire, that Israel has broken the cease-fire, when you look at it as a whole, I think most people think, look, I think the cease-fire will stick for some time. The real concern here though especially on the part of civilians and the governments frankly is whether or not they can come to a permanent solution. And that seems less likely in the near future. JOHNS: And it certainly appears that it will take quite a while to get to that permanent solution. This is not something that's going to happen overnight. SIDNER: No. There's a lot of things that are sticking parts, Joe, a lot of things that both sides say that they want, but they're absolutely not going to be able to agree on them. And they haven't been able to agree on them for many, many years since Hamas took over in 2007. So these are sticking points that I think they will try -- they will talk through them, they will try to get through them, but we may be waiting a very long time for a permanent solution in this particular situation, Joe. JOHNS: Sara Sidner reporting from Jerusalem, thank you for that. The people of Gaza and Southern Israel who for now can stop worrying about rockets and bombs falling in their neighborhoods are not the only winners in this week's truce. CNN's Paula Newton takes a look at the countries and leaders who won and lost in the conflict. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): However crude the calculation, especially amid the civilian casualties, there are winners and losers in this truce, and they are already reshaping political alliances in the region. We begin in Egypt, and its President Mohammed Morsi. Clearly underestimated, his deft handling of what is a mine field of competing interests has given him much-needed political capital in both the Arab world and the United States.

It's been an emotional and political flash point until now. Today, we hear President Obama plans to reverse that Bush policy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL J.

And I think that`s what he`s done in this case, in all different aspects that we look at, not only the social services but with the defendants and the prosecution in this case. He`s just manipulated so many people that it`s hard to tell what the true story is. VELEZ-MITCHELL: Now, Little Josh, the defendant, your former foster son, has been described by some people as an innocent, nice, quiet boy. And by other people, including his monster father -- as a demon seed, demon child, a tough kid who would very easily pick up a bat or a pipe and beat somebody to death to please and win approval with his violent father. What do you say? You lived with him. STONEBURNER: Yes, we -- Josh lived at our house for over seven months, 24/7. And I didn`t see any of that. He played. We ate together. We did work around the house together. None of that was Josh -- Josh Young. He was a great kid in school, great kid around the house. So to say that about Josh is just another one of Gouker`s manipulations. VELEZ-MITCHELL: Well, hang on, sir. I appreciate you joining us. A short break and then I have another question, do you want him back if he`s found not guilty? Stay right there.

First of all, I applaud you for your work as a foster dad. Does it hurt when you hear that your former foster son would have done anything and loved his biological dad who is this violent, vicious ex-con? STONEBURNER: Yes, it does, but in our training to be foster parents, we understood that every child -- of course, depending on their situation - - but just about every child wants that reunification with their parent. And for Josh, it was no different. His mother is deceased. So the only person he had left was his dad. VELEZ-MITCHELL: I have a yes or no question because we are almost out of time.

(MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING) AMANPOUR: And finally tonight, if you read it in a spy novel, you probably wouldn't even believe it. Back in 1997, Khaled Meshaal was the subject of a bizarre assassination attempt. It was when he was in Jordan and he was confronted by a Mossad agent, who tried to shoot a poison into his ear. In fact, they did. Apparently that was under the approval of then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Now then King Hussein of Jordan, who had a peace treaty with Israel, threatened to break it off unless he got the antidote. He asked for the antidote and he got it, and Meshaal lived to fight another day. He told me about it today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MESHAAL (through translator): But God saved me when they tried to assassinate me. AMANPOUR: King Hussein saved you. MESHAAL: Allah saved me. Then King Hussein. AMANPOUR: King Hussein demanded the poison and the antidote. MESHAAL (through translator): This -- and this is a standing that is great on the part of King Hussein, and I'm still loyal to him and I pray for him. And I am obliged for this courageous stand that forced Netanyahu to give the antidote and thank God I was healed. But I mention this in the vein of the Israeli crime. (END VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR: So after that assassination attempt, more than 15 years ago, Meshaal went on, as we know, to become head of Hamas. And now it seems that both he and Netanyahu, old foes, are constantly locked in this mortal combat. We'll wait to see whether this cease-fire brings any change at all to this situation.

LEMON: Well, there does seem a bit of paranoia here especially when there have been so many leaks and they're concern about where there, you know, these leaks are coming from, asking people to turn over their cell phones and so going on the media saying that we're going to track down these leaks instead of figuring out how to fix the problem and where the leaks came about.

So what is this say about his thinking, the thinking that went into this? Laura. COATES: Well, obviously he is somebody who's aware that a lot of his appointees are not getting through with the speed that he anticipated. And, remember, these U.S. attorneys have to be confirmed by the Senate, they can't simply just be somebody that he appoints and says now you go and do the job. They have to actually pass the muster. And so the people that they're talking about right now, you got Dana Boente who is eastern Virginia U.S. attorney who stepped in when Sally Yates stepped down. We'll call it stepped down when she was fired by President Trump to replace the travel ban. And he stepped in and willingly have said he would enforce that law.

A spokesman for the group Jamat Aldawat (ph) denies the charge and tells CNN they never sent anyone to Britain to raise donations. John Conyngham spent years investigating money laundering. JOHN CONYNGHAM, CONTROL RISKS GROUP: It may well be of course that many or the vast majority of funds that were raised for this earthquake donations were coming from genuine people with genuine motivations wishing to help. We're talking about a very small percentage here where they may have decided to divert some of those funds for very different reasons. FEYERICK: And it's not just the money that's under scrutiny.

He tells CNN at least four of the alleged plotters traveled to Pakistan telling their families they were going help the earthquake victims. NASIR AHMED, MEMBER OF BRITISH PARLIAMENT: Anything could be possible. We don't have any facts. What is truth is that these young people went to Pakistan to help with the charitable cause.

That will be the moment we can breathe a sigh of relief. But that moment is not going to come for quite a while. Federal officials said 1-1.5 years at least.

For almost 50 years, no new diabetes drugs were introduced. But beginning about six years ago, the picture began changing dramatically. DR.

It's a night-and-day difference, the therapy of diabetes today versus just six years ago.

According to IMS Health, diabetes drugs alone have become a huge $8 billion-a-year retail industry, growing by 19 percent last year.

I want to bring in Isa Soares who is covering the campaign from northern France. How concerned are voters about this kind of information floating about? ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think on the whole people will be very worried in particular about the undecided voters because although the electoral commission has come out and basically asked the media, the press, to not talk about the content of those e-mails by which the press have actually abided by that, there is obviously a fear that with social media people can easily troll through those, download them, and then make up their minds. But you know I am in northern France. This is French rust belt, this is Le Pen territory. Many people here basically said it doesn't really matter, we've already made up our mind and will vote for Marine Le Pen. Even a Macron voter said to me I don't pay attention to that. I am voting for Emmanuel Macron. So it's interesting this has come out in the last 24 hours because perhaps if there had been a bigger time difference in terms of a week or so, that may have had a bigger impact. But the concern is real because we're talking about 14.5 gigabytes, Fredricka, of personal information from the Macron camp, and that is really worrying.

And at the same time this is happening, which provides inadequate care, the government has added additional requirements on Veterans' Affairs like the bioterrorism decontamination centers that V.A. hospitals, some of them must establish. And this is adding to the already overstretched burden that the Veterans' Affairs has at this time. HOPKINS: We saw the story that Casey Wian did about that vet that wasn't able to get care for nine months. What kind of complaints have you been hearing from vets? GRANGE: I hear a lot of complaints from different veterans' associations, members of those things, whether it be American Legions, American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans Association. And there's a lot of veterans that are complaining. And sometimes the complaints may not be valid, but what happens is now that you have such a rash of these complaints that there's a perception that the Veterans' Affairs is inadequate, that they're failing the veterans. And really, they may have some internal problems, but the responsibility goes back to the government. The government is the one that can enable the Veterans' Affairs to meet the requirements expected by the veterans of this nation.

146344,257869,CNN,American Morning,"BILL HEMMER, CNN ANCHOR: All right, let's get back to Iraq right now. It has made its weapons declaration. The document is now being analyzed by U.N. personnel. How, then, does it change the situation on the ground for the inspectors? Twenty-five more arrived in Baghdad yesterday. The numbers will top at a hundred eventually. And the former chief inspector, Richard Butler, now joins us again from Down Under in his home country of Australia. Richard, good to have you back here. Hello to you. RICHARD BUTLER, FORMER CHIEF U.N. INSPECTOR: Good to be here, Bill. Hello. HEMMER: If you were examining this document dump, essentially, what do you want to know first, where do you go first in terms of dissecting the information? BUTLER: You carve the document up into its four main parts -- missile, chemical, biological and nuclear. You then put your team of experts in each of those fields onto that document alongside the same information that Iraq has filed over the past 10 years, its past declarations, and the over one million pages of documents that we had put together in the past, documents taken from Iraq. And, Bill, what you do essentially is you compare the past, what you know about the past with what Iraq now declares as its present position in order to see where the discrepancies and differences, if any, might lie. That's the first thing you do. The second thing is that you look to see what might have happened in the four years without inspection, the years where the United States is claiming, for example, that it has intelligence that Iraq has made further weapons of mass destruction. In that sense, you start to look into the future, that is, what has happened in recent time and what the present situation is. HEMMER: Now, Richard, if you look at some of the people who have examined these in the past and if you listen to the high ranking administration officials in Washington, they will argue time and time again that they may be large in content in terms of number, but they are not substantial in content. Do you see the difference they're trying to draw here and do you agree with that? BUTLER: Well, I'm not sure that I do see the difference because, you know, what is essentially at issue here is what has always been at issue, namely, Iraq's obligation to come forward with its weapons of mass destruction program. What I'm concerned about in the present juncture with a 12,000 page document and a growing noise of propaganda from both sides is that sight will be lost of that fundamental obligation. What I'm concerned about, Bill, and I'll come straight to this point, is that, you know, people really ought to just take a rest, go to the movies, take a holiday for a few weeks and allow the inspectors to get on with the job that they're mandated to do, which is to examine",0.1195406728380383,2002-12-09

Now the Carolinas you are evacuating, but for a lot of other folks, you still have time to get ready, but you're not going to have much more time. And being prepared is the key part of this to reduce the impacts of these storms particularly for life safety. CROWLEY: OK, let me get really personal here. When you say get ready, I have a son in New York City. What does he do to get ready? FUGATE: All right. First thing first go to the New York City Office of Emergency Management Web page or look in the information that does he live in an evacuation zone. Mayor Bloomberg and his team were talking about it this morning. These folks in the evacuation zones need to be ready to evacuate and know where the bus pickup points will be and how to get to the safe locations. If you're not in the evacuation zone be prepared if the power goes out, if we lose water pressure or water goes out and that may be not just for hours, it could be for days. You may lose communications. You may have difficulty to getting cell service. You want to make sure you've got a battery-powered radio, a lot of batteries for your flashlights and the ability to charge that cell phone if you don't have power whether it's a hand crank or some other way to keep it charged. These are the steps you take to get ready. You can go to Ready.gov or to the local emergency management Web sites to get information. But you need to find out now, are you in an evacuation zone, and if you are, where to go if the evacuation is required, if you're not what to do if you lose power, lose water. Maybe not be able to get out and get supplies for several days, what you need to have on hand to get through that first couple of days after the storm hits. CROWLEY: And the communications problem we had an experience in the earthquake the other day when it was just difficult to get a cell out of Washington, D.C., to do any phone calling, whereas the text seemed to work fairly well. Twitter was great. What can be done to alleviate that sort of thing? Or should people just not rely that those cell phones are going to work in the instance of a storm this big hitting so many people. FUGATE: I think you just need to be prepared, not only could we have congestion on the systems, but with a lot of power outages we could have reduced capacity and that's one of the things that you know use alternatives. And again, as we saw people using social media and texting, they were able to sometimes get through those bottlenecks, but also remember that it may be difficult to call a",0.2291638372040382,2011-08-25

That popularity and political capital, so-called, is reminiscent of George W. Bush after he won in 2004 and squandered that political capital rather quickly. That has to be a concern here, is it not? BASH: Certainly. There's no question, it's a concern. And, you know, over at the White House they basically say they have no choice. In fact, Barack Obama, when he was behind closed doors with Republicans yesterday, he said, I don't want to be doing this as my first bill. I don't want to be spending this kind of government money, taxpayer money, my first thing out of the gate here. But he thinks he has no choice. However, speaking to what Jessica said, that's -- the reality is, he's facing it head on. And that is that as much as he said during the campaign he wants to change Washington, he's got to deal not just with Republicans who voted no but with his Democratic leaders right here in the Congress who basically didn't necessarily change enough in terms of how they approached this kind of big spending bill in order to get those Republicans and make Obama have that bipartisan vote. DOBBS: Thank you very much, Dana. Thank you, Ed, appreciate it. Thank you very much, Jessica. This so-called stimulus package will cost taxpayers at a minimum $1.2 trillion over a decade. The Congressional Budget Office says that total includes almost $350 billion of interest payments, $350 billion, congressional Democrats however ignoring the interest payments. They say the package will cost 819 billion. That was the most recent total, Democrats saying that includes 275 billion in tax cuts, a number much higher than the CBO's estimate at 212 as of yesterday. All of this is changing, by the way, day by day and there will be, according, again, to the Democratic leadership 544 billion of new spending in its plan. Republicans, however, saying the package is just a massive boondoggle for liberal and left wing special interest groups, a wish list based on decades of frustrated liberal spending proposals that have not succeeded. We'd like to know what you think about our new government. Here's tonight's poll question.

Thank you, James Woolsey, the former CIA director. Ambassador, thanks for coming on. We appreciate it. WOOLSEY: Glad to be with you. GORANI: Well, let's get a different perspective on how Trump's Cabinet is taking shape and the potential battle some of his picks could meet from Democrats in Congress. I'm joined from Washington by CNN Political Commentator Bill Press. He supported Hillary Clinton and is the host of ""The Bill Press Show"" on Talk Radio. Bill, thanks for being with us. BILL PRESS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Hello. GORANI: I asked James Woolsey about Rex Tillerson there. What is your take on Rex Tillerson? Is this an appointment, perhaps, that the Democrats would be willing to fight? Because they have to pick their fights, they don't control either House on Capitol Hill and they have to be very careful who they decide to fight Trump on. PRESS: Yes. But may I just say a word first about what we just heard from Director Woolsey? I was appalled by what I heard for a couple of reasons. One, it just seems to me that he confirmed that the Trump team doesn't have a clue about what to do in Syria, and the only thing he could say is blaming Obama and then suggesting do just the opposite. Well, just the opposite of what President Obama did in Syria -- and by the way, I don't think President Obama has had huge success in Syria by any means, but Woolsey seems to be talking about putting boots on the ground. He said that not a lot but putting boots on the ground, about a no-fly zone, about bombing strikes in Syria, and about arming all the rebels. These are the things that President Obama didn't do. Is that what the Donald Trump really plans to do? I don't think the American people are ready for another war, you know, on the ground in Syria. I think that's so frightening -- GORANI: Although he didn't get -- PRESS: -- what we heard. GORANI: I was going to say, Bill, he didn't get into that level of detail, but it does seem as though the non-interventionist approach of Barack Obama -- PRESS: Yes.

As David said, we're living in a highly charged, highly politicized atmosphere, and everything has become politicized. Race has always been political. And the idea that we can have intelligent discourse about it at this point, when there's so many other things happening, it's not going to happen. Unfortunate, but it's not going to happen.

Up next, why the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wants to talk to BP CEO Tony Hayward and why, after several days and countless phone calls, we still can't get an answer about the flow rate. You call this transparency? We're ""Keeping Them Honest"", next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Well, tonight CNN has learned that Tony Hayward, the CEO of BP, has been invited by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to answer questions about whether BP influenced Scotland's release of a Libyan terrorist who bombed Pan Am Flight 103. You've heard the allegation, probably, that a deal was cut to protect British business interests in Libya. The decision to release the terrorist has been blasted by Britain and the White House now. We're told the committee wants Hayward to answer these questions next week. As for the spill, well, after months of setbacks and failed attempts, BP says the best chance of sealing off the well could happen this weekend with the static kill operation, meaning heavy mud is going to be pumped into the blowout preventer, forcing oil back beneath the sea floor. But as Chad Myers told us earlier, there's a threat of extreme weather in the next couple of days. And if that happens, operations could be put on hold. Now, the only way to accurately determine the company's liability in all of this is to measure the flow rate. How much oil actually poured out of that well? Now, the only way we can know that is by measuring it. And scientists say there are ways to get the flow rate now, but we just can't get a straight answer about it. First we asked BP about who determines the flow rate. BP said, well, hey, talk to Unified Command. We did that. We're told they had to kick it upstairs to senior officials for an answer.

You are the Secretary of State. Pontificating about, how do I sell this to the American public, is not his job. He needs to make a bright line statement about our commitment to Europe and NATO, as well as a statement to Russia. I will say one other thing. With all of this going on -- Syria, Europe, and the relationship between Russia and the United States -- we have this other thing, right, which is Russia's involvement with our elections, which ought to be addressed by Tillerson at this stage to ensure that at least in future elections, Russia does not do what it did in this last one. BERMAN: So, Commander, what about that? How closely is Russia watching the various election stories coming out of the United States including the news today that Carter Page, there was a FISA warrant on him? LIPPOLD: I think they're watching it but quite frankly, they're going to be disinterested in it. They waged an information warfare campaign during the election, the degree to which we're still trying to determine if it had any true effect on whether or not it helped President Trump get elected or not. But at the end of the day, when you go back to the Middle East and look at it, I think Juliette is absolutely right. He is the Secretary of State right now. Secretary Tillerson, you can't think out loud. What happened in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine is critical because the Europeans do look at that. They look at how the United States reacts to it, how we're going to engage in the future, and what that portends for NATO and all those countries. The Baltic countries, especially, are very concerned. As NATO members, if we are attacked, can we expect the NATO to be backing us? So we need strong statements. And you need something between what's thought up here and the filter that goes in before it comes out here from the Secretary of State.

So, it would seem that this nightmare for the residents of eastern Aleppo has resumed, but it's just the beginning at this point, it would seem, Zain. ASHER: And Jomana, given there was that sort of two and half-week lull, did that allow residents to actually use the humanitarian corridors to be able to get out in time and stand a chance? KARADSHEH: No. People have not been able to leave eastern Aleppo as far as we know, as activists are telling us and people are telling us. We've also heard this from the United Nations too. People are pretty much trapped in eastern Aleppo. And Zain, when you talk to people there, they tell you that they're very weary of these so-called humanitarian corridors, they really don't trust that they're going to be safe when they leave at all. It's part of this mistrust between them and the regime. They don't really think that they will be allowed safe passage. These are the people who would think of leaving, and there are people who would want to leave eastern Aleppo after being trapped in what has become this giant kill box as it's been described. And other people, Zain, say they do not want to leave, this is their homeland, this is their home, they have nowhere else to go. But the situation has never been so bad according to activist in eastern Aleppo. And it's not just this military campaign that seems to have started that people are facing this indiscriminate bombardment of their neighborhoods. There's also that devastating humanitarian situation that is only going to get worse as we've heard the warnings from the U.N. with people running out of almost everything. All sorts of supplies. When you're talking about the fuel that they need for -- they would use for cooking, that also now with the harsh winter ahead, that they would use for heating.

Just last week, former candidate Congressman Richard Gephardt endorsed Kerry as well. The Democrats have had the Republicans on the defensive of late. But tonight, the Republicans are to launch a counter attack. RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie is expected to accuse the Democrats of planning -- quote -- ""the dirtiest campaign in modern presidential politics."" Bob Franken reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BOB FRANKEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Both sides can expect to take a lot of fire. And it goes without saying that it's far better to be the shooter than the target, which may explain the event speeches from Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, the latest tonight in Nevada, as Democrats lob their own heavy artillery. TERRY MCAULIFFE, DNC CHAIRMAN: I would call it AWOL. You call it whatever you want, but the issue is, the president did not show up for the year he was in Alabama, when he was supposed to show up for the National Guard. FRANKEN: Gillespie is shooting back, as he had for months, charging that opponents have made clear they intend to run the dirtiest campaign in modern presidential Palestinians. Gillespie will go on to charge, he expects Democrats to use the Internet to spread a scurrilous story that President Bush drove a former girlfriend to an abortion clinic and paid for her abortion. He's quoting a rock musician Kerry supporter in a ""New York Daily News"" article. The Democrats' press secretary had a response. ""Ed is hyperventilating."" Gillespie isn't through. He quotes a newspaper article. ""Teresa Heinz Kerry gave over $50,000 to the League of Conservation Voters, which has endorsed her husband's candidacy."" The League says she made a contribution in may of May 2000 of $2,500.

OAKLEY: Wolf, we turned our back on Afghanistan and Pakistan about 10 years ago, and we lost a lot of knowledge. And we've been working with the Northern Alliance for the past two or three years in the hopes of getting Osama bin Laden. But we've forgotten the fact that the Northern Alliance politically and militarily is not that strong compared to the country as a whole and compared to the Taliban, which had much more drive and much more popular support. And all this has to change. We have to forge an alliance among Afghans which will include the Northern Alliance but also the others. BLITZER: When you say the others, you mean the Pashtuns obviously... OAKLEY: The Pashtuns, the... BLITZER: But including elements of the Taliban? OAKLEY: The Taliban is like an onion, you can peel it away. A lot of the commanders joined the Taliban in part because they wanted to get the Northern Alliance out of Kabul and in part because they saw the opportunity for victory. The commanders can change sides two or three times in a day. Afghans don't really -- they're not very a coherent society, so you have to peel away the outside elements of the Taliban till you get down to the hard core. People like Mullah Omar, they're the fighters. But the rest of them can be swayed one way or another. They can be intimidated, they can be bought, they can shift. And therefore, you have to distinguish there are degrees of Taliban. Put the true believers in the middle, put the others on the outside, and you can move them away by military force and by political action. BLITZER: Senator Boren, you were in the Senate when the Soviets were defeated in Afghanistan, and then the U.S., as Ambassador Oakley just said, simply walked away not only from Afghanistan, but also began to walk away from Pakistan as well. Obviously with hindsight, a major strategic error, right? BOREN: A major error. Any time we walk away we create a vacuum, a power vacuum. It's going to be filled, and it's very often in this kind of world filled with chaos. And so we have to refocus. We have to get new strengths brought to bear. We're going to have to have a lot more human capability. And again, I go back. While the military has a very strong role to play in this, and while it's very necessary -- and it's necessary to bring about a political solution on the ground, it's also necessary in disrupting the terrorist organizations and their ability to function around the world. Still, ultimately, the longer term -- and I'm talking now here the next three, four, five years in terms of bringing security back to the American people and the rest of the world -- that's going",0.1721866096866097,2001-11-04

Appreciate the reporting. Pope Francis is making another move that matters, as well, announcing a streamlining of marriage annulments. Remember, Catholics don't believe in divorce. But these decrees achieve the same end, allowing those who get civil divorces and remarry to remain in the church. Now, the move will make annulments less costly and time-consuming.

The former vice president is expected to warn that the agreement will give Iran the capacity to destroy the United States. Here's an excerpt from the speech, given to CNN.

A couple of years ago, I was fortune enough to spend some time with Patrick Swayze on his ranch in California. It was part of the Quest for Dance program that we did right here on CNN. As we mark the passing of an industry legend, I wanted to share a minute or so of that special moment with you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK SWAYZE, ACTOR: My father was really the cowboy that fell in love with the intensely talented big city girl, you know. And so I had ranch life as, you know, and horses in my world from the time I was little, as -- as well as having the arts. But it's just like doing so many of my own stunts for so many years, it's like I -- I wouldn't have had that -- I wouldn't have had the ability to -- to pull off the things I pulled off in -- in my acting career if I didn't have that level of -- of -- of technique and training as a dancer. QUEST: Do you see any form of contradiction between sort of the suave elegance of ballet and dancing and ranch life? SWAYZE: I love my animals. They're -- they're a wonderful emotional barometer. If -- if I'm not right with myself and I'm not 100 percent present and accounted for, he will not work for me and I might as well get away from him. So my animals really tell me whether I'm buying the hype or not or -- or whether I'm really 100 percent myself. I don't think I would have survived this career if I -- if I hadn't made animals such an important part of my life. They teach you (INAUDIBLE) freedom of movement. They teach you so much as a dancer. The pure essence of spirit and energy. And it's -- there's something magical about that union with a horse. You come offstage and everybody goes, you know, go wow, that was a beautiful performance, but you know it wasn't there. You know there was -- you were making it up or -- or you were trying too hard. And that's the hardest thing to do, is to get out of your own way. But when it happens -- when it happens, something beau -- something beautiful takes -- takes hold. QUEST: All right, the hard one. I'm going to give you a choice -- dancing or acting. Which is it to be? SWAYZE: Oh, well, I was a dancer first. My mother didn't believe you could ever -- ever be -- be a true artist or learn how to spell the word unless you were well versed in every level of the arts -- as a dancer, as an actor, as a singer.

I mean, this is something that's I think I'm going to -- I think I'm going to keep them close to me for a while. I think I'll probably put them on a chain. And I don't even own a wedding ring, and I'll just wear them, and I'm going to hold on to them for my boys. HOLMES (voice over): Alan Armstrong just wanted to give his little boys deeply personal keepsakes to remember their mother by. The engagement and wedding rings she designed would have been perfect. The problem was they disappeared after Katherine Armstrong was taken to Atlanta's Grady Hospital after a car crash two weeks ago. Who would do such a thing? Police have now identified a suspect, a 54-year-old hospital employee. Police say security video shows Takuma Jawara (ph) with a property bag containing the rings, and that he eventually cooperated, providing information through his attorney about where the rings were taken. Police say they then recovered those rings at an Atlanta pawn shop, where they allegedly were taken by a family member. On Friday, police returned the rings to Armstrong. ARMSTRONG: I only had these in my hands one other time, and that's when I put them on her -- you know, her finger. And, you know, I know that she would be -- these were so special to her. And she would just be mortified to think that they're sitting in some pawnshop somewhere and that some scum had taken them from her finger. So, you know, I think it's a great thing for the boys to have. HOLMES: While Armstrong is relieved to have the rings back, he still harbors a lot of anger toward Grady Hospital. ARMSTRONG: Grady had just been completely inept. They weren't responsive. They just wanted to focus on the monetary recovery (ph). HOLMES: Grady Hospital's CEO issues this statement: ""We are pleased that the rings have been recovered and returned to Mr. Armstrong. While we regret that this incident ever occurred, we want to acknowledge the hard work and diligence of our health system investigators, the cooperative effort with Atlanta Police and Grady Administration's commitment to locating the missing rings and the person responsible for their disappearance. In a health system that has around 900,000 patient encounters per year, there were a total of 260 theft reports in 2007, and each was thoroughly investigated."" I spoke with Alan Armstrong about the theft, the hospital's efforts to recover them, and why he was insisting he'd get them back. Here's what he said ARMSTRONG: I knew that there's -- put it this way, I knew there was 0.0 chance I'd get them back if I didn't push hard. And so that's all I could do. And my wife would have expected me to do that. HOLMES (on camera): What do you want to do with those rings now? You said it's something you wanted your boys to have.

So, any time something happens, our people are there. In fact, they're already there. I think it's ambitious. I want to hear the plan. I want to hear -- I'm cautious about -- when you hear ground troops in Syria, that is one of the thing that really scares me in terms of right now there are all these great powers, Russia, Turkey, Iran, Israel, us, other folks that are playing in that battle space. So, how do you deal with deconfliction, because you don't want it to escalate into some other world conflict, quite frankly. So, I would like to hear that. I would like to hear the plans. I have confidence, however, that being said, in General Mattis, McMaster as well too. And I think that they will serve the president well. But I certainly want to hear more about the details of the operation. BLITZER: And Chairman Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. TAYLOR: And Dunford as well. BLITZER: But there are what, about 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq right now, supposedly advisers, although they're in very dangerous situation and they're all wearing boots and they're on the ground and, what, a few hundred in Syria right now, very special operators. TAYLOR: Sure. BLITZER: Very, very dangerous. You're fully experienced. But if you're to defeat and destroy ISIS in Mosul, and Iraqi troops are there, but in Raqqa, their so-called capital of their caliphate, you are going to have to send in a lot of ground forces to do it. And the U.S. is going to have to be involved. Would you support that? TAYLOR: As I said, I need to hear more information. Like I said, you have these great powers playing in that battle space. And before, you never had something like that, where you had, again, Russia, Turkey, Iran, Israel, as well, too, and some other folks that are in that battle space. How do we deconflict? What does that look that? That's something that I'm confident that the generals can do. But I want to hear about it before I would say that that makes sense. Yes, you talked about boots on the ground. I think it was misleading, obviously, of the last administration to say no boots on the ground. They're all boots on the ground that are there. They're all combat troops that are there. BLITZER: And they're all in harm's way. TAYLOR: Absolutely. They're in harm's way. And creating that vacuum that's there, we had to do that.

President Bush returned to the White House tonight. Elaine Quijano has the report from the White House. Elaine? ELAINE QUIJANO, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hello to you, Lou. Important to emphasize here, what we are learning about comes to us from the Secret Service, who says that this is a report given to them by security authorities in the country of Georgia. The information that Secret Service Spokesman Jim Macken (ph) has passed along is that after the president departed the country of Georgia, that they were notified -- Secret Service was notified -- by host country security authorities that there had been some kind of incident involving what has been described as a hand grenade, thrown approximately 100 feet within the stage during President Bush's speech in Tbilisi, Georgia. Now, the device apparently hit an individual, according to the report, fell to the ground. It was recognized, apparently, by the Georgian security authorities who are on the ground there, and they picked it up and took it away. And this is all according, again, to the host country security authorities. Now, the Secret Service says that they will be investigating, of course, as well as members of the FBI, the State Department, and the host country authorities, looking further into the report. But, Lou, important to emphasize right now, they say they have not, at this particular point, been able to verify. They haven't necessarily been able to take a look at this for themselves. They say that they were only notified about this a couple of hours after President Bush actually left the country of Georgia, but that information coming into us just a short time ago, Lou. DOBBS: A peculiar story. So, this information, coming to CNN from the Secret Service, and the Secret Service did not know about this until informed, apparently, by the Georgian government and Georgian authorities, upon the president's departure from Georgia, is that correct? QUIJANO: That is correct. They tell us that they did not learn about this until the president had already left the country. The president arrived here at the White House just a short time ago.

But at the end of the day, or at the beginning of the week, we should say, what's clear, the president got what he wanted here. Eddie Gallagher is remaining as a Navy SEAL, not losing his trident, and the military establishment very upset about what this means for discipline in the ranks. We'll discuss the implications, the major implications, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GOLODRYGA: A senior defense official tells CNN that Pentagon chief Mark Esper fired Navy Secretary Richard Spencer after he went outside the chain of command, proposing with a, quote, ""secret agreement"" with the White House involving the case of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher. Back with us, CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr; and also joining us, CNN military and diplomatic analyst, Rear Admiral John Kirby. He was a former press secretary for the U.S. Navy and the Pentagon. Don't envy the person who has that job now. Admiral Kirby, let me begin with you. What do you make about the developments about the fact that the Navy secretary, at least according to the White House and the Defense Department, went around Esper to the White House to try to come up with a secret channel of communication? ADMIRAL JOHN KIRBY (RET.), CNN MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC ANALYST: If that's true, if Esper's account of this is true, then he certainly -- he, Esper, was certainly well within his rights to -- to relieve the secretary of the Navy of his duties for lack of trust and confidence. I mean, that's simply an egregious set of behaviors there if you're going around your boss to try to cut a deal. It also sends a very chilling message to the Navy about the degree to which the fix was in and Gallagher was going to get his pin from the get-go, regardless of the review process, which just a day prior, Mr. Spencer said, you know, he wanted to proceed appropriately and -- and unimpinged by political interests. So it's a very troubling set of circumstances. The problem is, Bianna, we don't know whose version of this is accurate. Trump puts out a tweet saying that, you know, he fired Spencer because of contracting problems, as well as the review process. Esper says he fired Spencer for going around his back. And Esper -- and Spencer says he quit, because he couldn't follow an order he couldn't believe in. So it's very difficult to shake it out.

OREN: Again, we prefer to look at the Egyptian deeds and we hope they will play a constructive role in helping to convince Hamas to stop firing these thousands of rockets at our civilians. MORGAN: Is your intention at the same time to continue targeting Hamas leaders and to continue, if you can, killing them? OREN: Well, we're going to take any measures necessary to stop the aggression against the civilians. And we're taking immense precautions not to hurt Palestinian civilians. We -- our planes have carried out hundreds of attacks and the number of Palestinian civilians that have been hurt have been very, very small. We regret any loss of civilian life. But we're fighting an enemy -- keep in mind, Piers -- we're fighting an enemy that is hiding behind its own civilian population while it's trying to kill a maximum number of Israeli civilians. The difference between a terrorist organization and a democratic state is trying to minimize the number of civilians who are hurt. We make tens of thousands of phone calls to Palestinians in areas that might be hit, giving them ample warning to leave their homes. We send them text messages. We leaflet their areas. We are exercising immense caution. In one case that I know of, an Israeli pilot actually aborted a bombing run against the long-range rocket because he saw children running around that rocket, that area and one of the rockets later hit outside of Tel Aviv. It's the price we paid for what we do. MORGAN: Right. I mean, it's an awful price that the Israeli people have to pay for the endless rockets fired at them. But there's also an increasingly large number of women and children being wounded and killed in Gaza too. And there is a humanitarian aspect of this. And the core problem has got to get fixed. This has been going on for years and years and years, and it seems to be completely insoluble to any politician. What is the way to break through this? OREN: The way to break through it would be for the Palestinians to accept that there is a state of Israel, which is permanent and legitimate, and to sit down with us at the negotiating table to negotiate all the outstanding issues -- whether it'd be borders, refugees, Jerusalem, security, recognition. That's the position of the government of Israel. It's the position of the Obama administration. It's the position of the European Union and the quartet. It is not the position of Hamas and the terrorists. They're dedicated to our destruction. MORGAN: Ambassador Oren, thank you very much for joining me. OREN: Pleasure, Piers. MORGAN: And joining me now is Dr. Hanan Ashrawi of the Palestinian Legislative Council, a member of the PLO Executive Committee. Welcome to you. HANAN ASHRAWI, MEMBER, PALESTINIAN LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL: Thank you, Piers. Good to be",0.0425001616195199,2012-11-16

COOPER: What is it like being one of the only people in your party willing to actually speak out about what happened on January 6th, stand up to the big lie publicly? I mean, you alluded previously to the threat your stance may pose to your career. I know, you'll say that's not really, you know, what concerns you. Things are more important than that. But I mean, does it frustrate you at all that, you know, this could get you voted out of Congress? KINZINGER: Look, it makes me sad. Sad, because I know this is true. And all my colleagues know this is true. It's confusing, because I thought so many of the people I know like Kevin McCarthy had a red line that they just wouldn't cross, that there would be no payoff worth crossing that line. It feels isolating, but I'm going to tell you, seriously, it actually is very peaceful. Because I know I can say what's true. I know that even if I'm standing alone with Liz Cheney and a few others, like those that voted with me to impeach and you know, some of the senators, I know that history will judge it correctly and I know that it's a very important thing. There's never been a moment in Congress, Anderson, no matter any vote I've taken, any speech I've given that has ever, to me been more cut and dry, and clear and more of demanding desire and need, even to stand alone to tell that truth. Because I really believe and I'm not -- I'm not being emotional or dramatic, I believe that the future of this country and the Republic rests on telling people the truth. And until we accept that, there is real damage done to not just America, but America's reputation with these Putin-type tactics that are happening. COOPER: I want to ask you about Afghanistan. We talked about this the last time you were on, not only did you deserve there in the Air Force, you are also currently serving the Air National Guard as Lieutenant Colonel. I know you've said you disagree with President Biden on his decision to withdraw U.S. forces, the decision obviously has been made. Are you surprised? I assume you're not surprised at what's happening there. The Taliban is obviously capturing new territory. We're seeing, you know, Afghan troops giving up in some places, and obviously a lot of Afghan Forces soldiers, police have been killed fighting the Taliban.

SHEHRBANO TASEER, CHILDREN OF ASSASSINATED GOVERNOR: To her friends, to her supporters, the people who didn't know who believed it what she believed in. It's a tragedy. LAWRENCE: The children of Governor Salman Taseer heard about Gabrielle Giffords. Their father was assassinated for trying to change Pakistan's blasphemy laws which make it a crime to insult Islam. And that, they say is where the two shootings diverge. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My sympathy. I mean, my heart is with totally with the Congresswoman. But the difference is that in Pakistan, this is a message to all liberal and progressive people to keep quiet and to try and scare and intimidate them. LAWRENCE: Even Giffords' political opponents condemned her shooter. REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), MAJORITY LEADER: An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve. LAWRENCE: In Pakistan, few politicians spoke up, afraid to anger hard liners who condemned the governor and hailed his shooter as a hero. SHEHRBANO TASEER: It makes me sick. It makes me sick to my stomach. LAWRENCE (on camera): Crimes were similar but are the implications of the crimes the same? SARA TASEER, DAUGHTER OF ASSASINATED GOVERNOR: The fact is it is different and the fear amongst the people. (INAUDIBLE) The general public is feeling threatened; they don't feel they can voice their views or openly condemn it. We are in a totally different situation. People who support us can lose their own lives. LAWRENCE (voice-over): Some Pakistanis prayed for the governor Sunday, but militants warned people not to publicly pay their respects. SHEHRYAR TASSER, SON OF ASSINATED GOVERNOR: Anyone who visits, who takes up the case of the governor and his family, their offices would be burned. Their person will be killed. LAWRENCE: Similar shootings, different reactions. Chris Lawrence, CNN, Lahore. (END VIDEOTAPE) VELSHI: And that situation in Pakistan is going to have a great deal of influence on how they govern that country, so we'll keep you on top of that. OK. Back to the United States. I have a quick question for you. Which U.S. city is the most literate? I'll have you the answer on the other side of the break. It might surprise you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) VELSHI: Before the break, I asked you which U.S. city do you think is the most literate? Hre are the top five cities. Number five, Pittsburgh. Number four, Atlanta. Number 3, Minneapolis. Number two, Seattle. And in the Number 1 spot, Washington, D.C. According to an annual study, the nation's capital is the most well read. Just so you know, the study does not measure the number of people who can read but the number of people who actually do read. Keeping this study in mind, former D.C. public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee is now working toward getting more school districts to make changes in the interests of students.

A third deputy that was here, heard this, went out to the location, and he ended up getting shot, too. (END VIDEO CLIP) CASAREZ: Now, when they say that that person came out of nowhere, what Houston police is now saying is that someone came from behind a car with a rifle. And started to shoot, as those officers were on the ground. One was shot in the back. He is in surgery today. The other one succumbed to his wounds. And the third deputy came out when he heard everything, and he was shot in the leg. Has multiple broken bones in his leg. And it is very ironic, because the police chief from Houston is actually in Washington, D.C., where we just highlighted minutes ago, President Biden talking about and giving his remarks on the fallen officers of this country. The police chief of Houston lighting a memorial for the fallen officers of Houston. And now his deputies, his constables in Houston, having to deal with this ironically, on the very same day. WHITFIELD: My goodness. All right. Jean Casarez, thank you so much. Keep us posted. All right. Coming up next, a school official has sparked an uproar about teaching history in Texas. Why she asked teachers to bring in books with opposing views of the Holocaust. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WHITFIELD: An update now on that nearly total abortion ban law in Texas. A federal appeals court is siding with the state, allowing the law to stay in place. Texas has the most restrictive abortion law in the country. It bans abortions after six weeks into a pregnancy and often before a woman knows she is pregnant. With the 5th Circuit's latest move, the Justice Department says it will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and block the law. In Texas, also, a school superintendent is apologizing after an administrator suggested, teachers should include books that have opposing views of the Holocaust. CNN's Ed Lavandera reports the incident stems from confusion over state law limiting conversations about race and history in schools. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED TEACHER, SOUTHLAKE, TEXAS: Being told to get rid of your library or include opposing viewpoints on what they called controversial subjects. ED LAVANDERA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): To tell this story, this schoolteacher says she has to speak out under the cover of secrecy. She says she fears never being able to get a job as an educator again. UNIDENTIFIED TEACHER: Teachers are actively getting threats if they're speaking out at this point, perhaps to destroy their lives, to come for their license, to go after their families. LAVANDERA: Last week Carroll Independent School District administrators in the suburb of Southlake, Texas, held training sessions laying out the guidelines, teachers needed to follow to pick the books for their classroom libraries.

DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Congressman Schiff, thank you so much for coming out here. You really got under Trey Gowdy's skin. Was that your intention? REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), SELECT COMMITTEE ON BENGHAZI: No. But I did think it was important to set up the context of the hearing today and the fact that - where this all began was when that Stop Hillary PAC submitted a bunch of signatures to us, calling for her to testify, and the fact that the committee has cancelled on all the other witnesses since January. This is the only hearing they were really interested in. In fact, they can't even tell us if there're going to have hearings after this or who they would be with. BASH: Now the arguments that Republicans have been making over and over again, we heard it from Trey Gowdy in there, very specifically is that this is not a prosecution. This is an investigation. SCHIFF: Well, I think if you look at the cross examination he tried to do of the secretary and his reference to a courtroom, it looks like an awful lot like a prosecution. The only difference I think between this and a prosecution is, in a prosecution, you know where you're going. This committee has no idea where it's going apart from an interest in damaging Secretary Clinton. BASH: Isn't that what an investigation is all about? You don't know where you're going. You let the facts lead you. SCHIFF: No, no, no. Ideally, in an investigation, you know what your object is in the sense of what you want to try to find out. So we asked in the very beginning, is this about determining whether there was gun running? Is this about determining whether there was a stand down order? Is this about whether there were any interferences in security? What are we going to be looking for? What is the scope? And they could never say. That is the quintessentially definition of a fishing expedition when you don't even know what you're looking for. BASH: Now, we did hear a couple of new things, namely - I don't think anybody at our shop had heard the fact that the secretary had e-mailed the Egyptian prime minister and - the day after the attack saying that she was sure that it was not based on the video. What does that tell you? SCHIFF: Well, what it tells you, if you look at the context, that day she received intelligence that there hadn't been a protest, that it was an assault on the compound. The following day, though, she received intelligence, as did we, that there were protests at the consulate at the diplomatic facility and the assessment of the intelligence agencies thereafter until we got the video from the compound itself",0.1453571366397994,2015-10-22

PFOTENHAUER: Well, we do a couple of things differently. For example, we say point blank that we're going to repeal the AMT, which would save the average family who is caught.... (CROSSTALK) BLITZER: That's the alternative minimum tax? PFOTENHAUER: Sorry, the alternative minimum tax. That would save the average family that is caught in that an estimated $2,700. We also do a few other things that are important, like make permanent the RND credit, move it up, allow for 100 percent of expensing. He's very focused on innovation and technology, and gotten applause all around the country and from editorial boards all over because of his call for a ban on cell phone taxes and the Internet taxes, because that's part of the engine that drives innovation. But let me get back to the middle class. It's not like we are forgetting the middle class. There's a very -- first of all, the best thing you could do for the middle class is improve the economic growth. And the other proposal... BLITZER: All right. PFOTENHAUER: ... Senator Obama's proposal, is going to lead to serious, seriously slower growth than Senator McCain's. BLITZER: Another major difference is on the issue of free trade between what McCain is supporting, what Obama is supporting. I will play this clip of what McCain says about Obama's strategy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MCCAIN: And he must know how foolish it is to think Americans can remain prosperous without opening new markets to our goods and services. But he feels he must defer to the special interests that support him. That's not change we can believe in. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: A lot of jobs are at stake here in the United States as a result of the export industry, as you know, Dan. TARULLO: That's correct, Wolf. Let me just say first, because there's one important issue from our last little colloquy that needs to be addressed. And that is, where are these cuts that Senator McCain says he will make going to come from? If you look at his tax plans, we would have to cut the equivalent of one out of every $4 of non-military discretionary spending. I mean, where is that going to come from? Is it going to Head Start? Is it going to be education? BLITZER: All right, but very quickly on the trade. TARULLO: On trade, look, Senator Obama, as he said today in Raleigh, has -- is for free trade. But he's not for trade policies that don't protect American workers. He's not for trade policies like the failed Korea agreement that failed to open up a market for U.S. manufactured goods. BLITZER: All right, guys, we're up against the clock, but I'm going to invite both of you back, because there's a lot more we want to discuss. PFOTENHAUER: I want to",0.022650311264743,2008-06-09

But I did try to ask the question at the very end of that briefing, will the Trump administration enforce, will the Justice Department enforce that subpoena? Wolf, she did not answer that as she left the Briefing Room. BLITZER: Thanks very much, Jim Acosta over at the White House. Let's dig deeper with CNN's chief legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin, and CNN law enforcement analyst Josh Campbell. Jeffrey, what are the potential consequences of Sam Nunberg defying the special counsel and refusing to comply with this grand jury order? JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: It is really very simple, Wolf. A grand jury subpoena is not an invitation to a birthday party which you can accept or reject at your pleasure. It is a legal command, and he's got to show up or they can find him in contempt, which can be punished by being jailed, by being fined, and that can go on indefinitely. Now, I do think that the Mueller office does not want to get into a freak show contest with this guy, who is obviously at least somewhat emotionally unstable. They will certainly try to reach out to his lawyer and say, come on, let's dial this back, get him in the grand jury, calm him down. But if he doesn't, and if he doesn't take the Fifth, because if he takes the Fifth, then he does have the right not to testify, but if he just simply says it is ridiculous, as he said to Gloria and to Jake, he could be locked up. BLITZER: Listen, Josh, to this clip from an interview that Gloria Borger had with Sam Nunberg. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Do you believe the special counsel has something on Donald Trump? I suspect that they suspect something about him. The way they asked about his business dealings, the way they asked if you had heard anything even during while I was fired, it just -- it just made me suspect that they suspect something about him. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: What do you think? JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, I think this is a puzzling day. These developments we were all involved in watching for some time now and trying to make sense, is this a strategy or is this just something who is unraveling before our very eyes? I think it is important to point out -- and I can tell you how these investigations work, having obtained more grand jury subpoenas than I can count, they're important cools. The reason they're used so much is because at end of the day, any investigation is about information. What information do you have before you that will allow you to conduct an investigation? As we listen to that clip and the interviews that Mr. Nunberg did today, one thing that stands out is it is quite possible that some of these records that",0.1605947353707164,2018-03-05

CUOMO: We will stay on it for sure and of course, update on Tracy Morgan's condition as we get new information. Coming up on NEW DAY, it's been 20 years, since the O.J. Simpson trial was must-see TV. Today we are going to tell you about a fascinating new poll that shows just how opinions have changed and how they may have stayed the same in some ways. So who says O.J. Simpson was guilty? We will break it down for you by the numbers. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PEREIRA: Welcome back to NEW DAY. Good to have you with us. This mark, if you can believe it, marks two decades before the start of one of the most infamous murder cases in the last century, O.J. Simpson, accused of killing his ex-wife and her friend led to a car chased that millions, remember this, watched live on TV. The trial watched live on TV exposing raw racial tensions in Los Angeles and around the nation, and even though a jury eventually acquitted O.J. Simpson of murder, attitudes him changed, especially the African-American community. We want to look at this. Bringing in our CNN correspondent, Don Lemon, always a pleasure to have you here bright and early in the morning. DON LEMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good to be here. PEREIRA: We know, of course, this trial so highlighted and racial divide in the country, but there's this poll. I want to show you the numbers. Let's take a look at 1994. A large majority of whites thought Simpson was guilty, 6 in 10 African-Americans believed the charges against Simpson were not true. Fast forward, 20 years later, look at the numbers now. Look at that. A majority of African-American now say the murder charges against Simpson were true. What do you think, and we have evolved as a culture, what has happened, what is the shift? LEMON: Well, I think that, you know, we've come to realize that's true and what's not over time, when you get to know someone personally, right? We have seen lots of O.J. Simpson, and I think that people looked at the -- whites and blacks looked at the evidence, the facts and came up with different conclusions because of preconceived notions. We all come to life with different filters. So I think many people looked at it objectively and they found O.J. Simpson guilty or not guilty, but I also think that many people looked at it and said, OK, this is a beautiful blond white woman and this guy killed by this black man. The black man is guilty. And then you have African-Americans who many of them are looked upon suspiciously and saw O.J. Simpson as some who was being set up by the system, being set",0.6157009345794393,2014-06-10

The reality is a young person in the newsroom was that there was a mission and Bob was really right, it was about finding out the truth. Walter was on and off camera the same. It was very exciting when Walter came down to Washington to anchor special report after special report with Bob and other reporters. I can remember one Watergate where indeed the transcripts had come out and everybody was assigned a role and they virtually read the parts of Nixon and Haldeman and Ehrlichman the key players in Watergate. It was a dynamic time. You understood the power. KURTZ: Let me jump in here and turn to Bernie Shaw. I want to ask you when you were at CBS, whether Cronkite was a tough task master and I also want to ask you about this letter -- this typewritten letter that he sent you when you were about to join the network. BERNIE SHAW, FORMER CBS CORRESPONDENT: He was very, very tough but that was part of the CBS News culture. We new reporters coming into bureau, the rookies, we had a responsibility and we had standards to live up to and to uphold. Cronkite and I go back to when I was in the Marine Corps in 1961 in Hawaii. And I called his hotel 34 times and he returned my call. We had a lobby meeting. He could only spare 20 minutes because he and Betsy had a formal to do go that night. But 20 minutes elapsed to 40 minutes. We were friends every since. And I didn't say anything to him when I went from Group W Westinghouse to being hired by Bill Small in the Washington Bureau for CBS. KURTZ: It's a great picture, by the way, what we're showing of all of the anchors including you while you're talking. There's the letter. SHAW: This is the letter which Cronkite said, ""Congratulations in joining CBS. I know you're sophisticated enough not to let petty thing annoy you."" And the last graph was, ""I look forward to seeing you on the ""CBS Evening News."" Three weeks later when I had a piece on the Cronkite show you could see the small smile curling at the edge of his mouth. Could I go back just briefly to the point about Walter's uncontrollable curiosity?

You can see they tried to board it up with plywood, but the storm, winds blew through it. And then, inside the restaurant, shoved everything up against the western wall of this place. And your heart just breaks. Peter, the owner of this place, I just left him a voice mail. One of his employees told me he had AAA insurance. I hope that's the case because this is a total write-off. You can see these were slips for jet skis that have been shoved up, blown into the restaurant. This was a hugely popular place on the Atlantic side of Key Largo. An institution for many years. Peter is from the Netherlands. He bought it a couple of years ago, expanded it. But if this is a sample of what we'll find in Key West, you know, paradise, southern paradise of the United States, as we know it, has fundamentally changed.

BLACKWELL: So let's start first with the proposals from the president. First raising the minimum rifle purchase age to 21. What's your view on that? WILLIAMS: Well, first of all, kind of like what we heard the gentleman say before, I think we need to focus on issues that are going to protect our children. I have a daughter that's in high school right now and a 7-month-old who's going to be in public schools for, what, 12 years after that. So we need to focus on real issues. That is why I went out there and proposed a plan that would actually protect their schools and the big part of that is giving our teachers the opportunity to protect themselves in the event of another tragedy like this happens so they can be armed. BLACKWELL: We'll get to the plan in a moment, but first, just your answer on if you support the president's plan of raising the minimum rifle purchase age to 21. WILLIAMS: I don't think that's going to save lives and we need to save lives right now. BLACKWELL: OK. Brent? BRENT BUDOWSKY, OPINION COLUMNIST, THE HILL: I think it will save lives and I support it like most Americans. BLACKWELL: All right. Let's go to the second one. Bump stocks. The president has urged or at least directed the attorney general to begin working on a plan to ban the sale of bump stocks. He referred to it as something that will turn a semiautomatic weapon into a machine gun. I want to show people what's on your Web site, Senator. You are running for governor here in Georgia. And this is a giveaway you have. WILLIAMS: Yes. BLACKWELL: Enter to win a bump stock. And this started if I remember correctly after a bump stock was used in the shooting in Las Vegas that ended with the deaths of more than 50 people and injuries of more than 500. Is the president wrong to call for a ban of bump stocks here? WILLIAMS: Again, like we talked about when we did the giveaway. The talking about banning bump stock is nothing more than a political game, a political ploy, because you can use a rubber band to do the exact same thing that a bump stock would do. So if you're going to ban bump stocks, we can go ahead and ban rubber bands as well. So I don't think again that banning bump stocks is going to be the issue here. BLACKWELL: Brent, bump stock, rubber band, no difference there? Your thoughts. BUDOWSKY: I think bump stocks will pass. I agree with most Americans. Yes, Victor, real quick.

NOBLES: What in particular stands out to you? ZELENY: I think that the thing, in particular, is Kamala Harris. She had the biggest bounce. Of course, she has been campaigning all year long. She jumped in just at basically the beginning of January. She had a big rise in there. But looking inside then numbers, one thing I am struck by, there's a big majority, some 56 percent of Democratic voters and Democratic leaning voters, who say their top priority is defeating the president. Of that subset, Bernie Sanders fares the worst among the top contenders because they want someone who can beat him. We are going to talk about this a lot, Ryan, you know, the purity test versus the pragmatic test. A lot of Democrats looking for someone who can beat President Trump. Of course, Senator Sanders says he is one of them -- Ryan? NOBLES: That's right. The Sanders camp would tell you his purity makes him the most electable. That's ultimately going to for the Democratic voters to decide ZELENY: Indeed. NOBLES: Jeff Zeleny, in Washington. Thank you, Jeff. Joining me now to talk more about this CNN politics reporter and editor-at-large, Chris Cillizza, and CNN political commentator, Angela Rye. She's the former executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus. Angela, I want to start with you. So much attention has been placed on Beto O'Rourke's fundraising numbers. Bernie Sanders' campaign is going to make this heavy emphasis on the fact they have more unique contributors. Does that really matter at this point? I mean, it really is a lot of money no matter how you slice it. ANGELA RYE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Sure. I think one of the things that Jeff just brought up is that Beto O'Rourke's numbers are more similar to Barack Obama's numbers, and I think that's not by mistake. I think once we start really understanding how the campaigns are unfolding, we're going to see a number of Obama former campaign staffers and consultants supporting his campaign. I think the other thing that's interesting for us, the field is crowded. There are a number of Democratic contenders. And any little small thing that will differentiate one person from another, I think they're going to tap into. Bernie Sanders, we know the talking points probably won't change that much. That $27 is going to be key to him because he's saying, hey, I'm not just for you little guy, I'm one of you. NOBLES: Right. Right.

Let me ask Joseph Cirincione, this week the U.S., again, with North Korea, North Korea saying it wants to unfreeze agreements. You also had the U.S. feuding with Iran about nuclear sites. Which is the greater threat really right now, North Korea or Iraq? CIRINCIONE: Right now it's got to be North Korea. I know that all the news stations, CNN included, have a ""Countdown to Iraq"". I think you might have to start splitting the screen. North Korea's got the more serious situation because it actually has nuclear material. It has plutonium. It could make a bomb, whereas Iraq does not. Right now we've got Saddam in a box. I think the situation in Iraq could stabilize for months, maybe even as long as a year. With North Korea, it's exactly the opposite. They started to unfreeze their nuclear weapons production capabilities. This could get very serious very soon.

But one of the reasons if that if God forbid something were to go wrong after someone gets the J&J vaccine, there is a good chance that the hospital, in E.R., would actually give the wrong treatment. So let's take a listen to Dr. Peter Marks from the FDA and Dr. Anne Schuchat from the CDC. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. PETER MARKS, DIRECTOR, FDA CENTER FOR BIOLOGICS EVALUATION AND RESEARCH: Treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from typical treatments for other types of blood clots, which usually involve an anticoagulant called Heparin. With cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, Heparin may be dangerous and alternative treatments need to be given. DR. ANNE SCHUCHAT, CDC PRINCIPAL DEPUTY DIRECTOR: As we learned about the issue with appropriate treatment, and it was clear to us that we needed to alert the public. (END VIDEO CLIP) COHEN: So the bottom line here is that this really is an immediate concern only for people who've had the J&J vaccine in the past three weeks. It is highly, highly unlikely that one of these clots will happen but you do need to watch out for it. Big picture as far as the vaccine supply goes. The federal government has made it clear that we can carry on and meet vaccine goals without having the J&J vaccine because it is such a small percentage of the U.S. vaccine arsenal. John?

Cooper, to the SHOWBIZ Flashpoint -- is it too much to believe that stars will start saying no to plastic surgery? COOPER LAWRENCE, SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: Well, I think this is the backlash of all those years of people like us sitting there and saying, ""Oh, god. Come on. We know you`ve had plastic surgery. Don`t try to fool us."" So now, not only are they coming forward and admitting to it, but they`re starting to say, you know what? It`s all about reality and reality television, reality this, reality that. Let`s be more real. But also, remember, these ladies have something to sell right now. Lisa Rinna has a TV show. Dana Delaney is on the cover of a magazine. I mean, she had this botched surgery seven years ago, but she`s telling us about it now. So that should tell you something. It`s like you`ve got to come up with something really personal about yourself when you`re selling a product, and the product is them. ANDERSON: Well, they could be -- they could be personal or honest about something else. So at least they are being honest about it and I applaud them for that. But talking about what sells, Cooper, here in Hollywood -- let`s face it. Wrinkles don`t sell. And the pressure to have a little nip, a little tuck is pretty unbelievable. So Kristin, to the SHOWBIZ Flashpoint, do you think stars will start to say no to plastic surgery? KRISTIN CRUZ, CO-HOST, ""THE MARK AND KRISTIN SHOW"": I don`t think there`s any way they can in Hollywood. I mean, that`s what being a star is all about.

And the people that this has happened to, they've run the political spectrum. But Harvard has a practice of, when something like this happens, they're not questioning -- what you said, which is a question that a lot of people wonder, what is this really -- is this him trying to have shock value, does this speak to him as a person? Harvard, blanket, has kind of said, we don't care. If you put this stuff on social media and we find out about it, we have a character clause, you're not coming in. What do you say to that? BRUNI: I'm not familiar with every case that's come before. There may be some cases where they didn't rescind except in -- I don't know the whole sample set we're looking at. I would hope that Harvard would look at these case by case and ask whether they're seeing an adolescent acting out in a completely inappropriate but not necessarily meaningful to who they are way. Or whether they've got to make those judgments in a careful way. They need to do that because they're not seeing the social media history of every applicant who comes in. You know, they happen to have eyes on this particular situation. How many situations do they not have eyes on, and do they have to keep that in mind as they lower the hammer on someone? That said, I think it's important to remember Harvard is a private institution. They admit I think something like 5.5 to 6.5 of the students that apply. It's their right to say who does and doesn't come to Harvard. And what the admissions process is entirely about is character judgments. The fact that something comes to light a couple weeks or months after an admissions decision has been made, that doesn't mean that can't be taken into account.

184569,326230,CNN,CNN Live Today,"LEON HARRIS, CNN ANCHOR: In London and throughout the U.K., they will no doubt be talking about the resignation of Prime Minister Tony Blair's communications director, Alastair Campbell. Let's get the latest on this and find out why he decided to step down. CNN's Finnoula Sweeney checks in from London. Finnoula, what you learned about this? FINNOULA SWEENEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Leon, it's only within the last 40 minutes that Alastair Campbell has announced his intention to resign. He said he'd do so in a matter of weeks. In a statement, he said that he'd been privileged to serve with the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair. He now looked forward to writing and broadcasting and making speeches, he said, and not taking on any new big job, as he put it. He doesn't intend to resign immediately, but it will become effective within the next few weeks. And the prime minister's office just behind us issued a statement within the last 10, 15 minutes or so, saying it regretted the resignation of Alastair Campbell, that he'd served the government well -- Leon. HARRIS: Well, I know Alastair Campbell also said earlier he planned on stepping down sometime this summer. But Finnoula, it's hard to believe that this has nothing to do at all with what they've -- what he's been enduring and what Prime Minister Tony Blair has been enduring with the hearings. SWEENEY: Indeed, there are those that are already saying that Alastair Campbell has decided to step down to save the government, as it were, to take some of the heat away from the spotlight that's been placed on the prime minister, Tony Blair, in relation to the inquiries surrounding the death of the top weapons expert, Dr. David Kelly, in July. There is, of course, going to be much speculation that the two events are connected. There hasn't been any official acknowledgment of that in the statement. But as you say, it had been widely predicted. That inquiry, of course, is still under way. And Justice Hutton is still inquiring as to the circumstances surrounding the death of David Kelly, and we'll have to await those findings within a matter of weeks before we can decide whether or not blame or responsibility is to be apportioned to whichever party. But there is no doubt in many minds that it is connected. I should add in that statement, Mr. Campbell said he wished to spend more time with his family. His partner, Fiona Miller, also works at Downing Street, and she has made it long known that she intends to also step aside within a matter of weeks. So both people saying it is officially, at least, for personal reasons -- Leon. HARRIS: All right, so just give me a sense of what the conventional wisdom is right now. Is this the only name we'll hear about stepping down in the days to come? Or will there be more? SWEENEY: That's a very good question. And I",0.6877047556645893,2003-08-29

Reza, what are you hearing from the front lines? Are the rebel forces having any chance of success right now? Or are they basically holding just what they have? SAYAH: Well, Wolf, today they claimed that they have recaptured the key oil town of Brega. But there's a couple things to keep in mind. First off, oftentimes the rebels inflate their claims, so it's important to independently verify this. And we're working to do that. And second of all, Brega has already changed hands several times. Three weeks ago, the rebels had this town. And not only did they have Brega. They had three towns west of Brega as well. And just like that in several days they lost it to regime forces. In fact they lost about 250 miles of territory to regime forces. So it shows you how reversible these gains are, how fluid the situation is. If they do have this town, it's certainly a significant get. It's a key oil town that both sides covet. But certainly this is no indication that all of a sudden these rebel forces have the capacity, the capability to go ahead and take on a professional army, like the Gadhafi forces. They're still outgunned, outmatched, and they're heavily reliant on these NATO airstrikes that oftentimes clear the way for them -- Wolf. BLITZER: And you have heard the report now that Human Rights Watch, the organization, is alleging, is claiming that the Libyan forces loyal to Gadhafi are using cluster munitions against civilian pockets in Misrata, the western side of the country. What are you hearing about -- what's the latest as far as the battle for Misrata is concerned? SAYAH: Well, the regime is coming out and vehemently denying this, but it's going to be interesting to see how the international community, how NATO, how the Obama administration reacts to this development. Once again, ""The New York Times"" and Human Rights Watch reporting that the Gadhafi regime using these banned cluster bombs.

CNN correspondent Nick Valencia talked to one of the women suing the school. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK VALENCIA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The allegations in the lawsuit are staggering. Six women, each of them current or former students at the University of Tennessee, each one alleges that they were sexually discriminated after reporting a rape by a university student athlete between 2013 and 2015. In the Title 9 lawsuit filed against the University of Tennessee this week, the plaintiffs say the university created a, quote, ""hostile sexual environment to female students."" The culture of indifference was so bad, the women say, that the university interfered with getting justice against their alleged attackers. Two of the athletes named in the lawsuit are currently awaiting trial for their rape charges. But in the other cases, the victims claim, the school did nothing to help. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We came together to change the environment, to change what is done about sexual assault. VALENCIA: It's CNN's policy not to name the victims of a sexual assault or rape.

And then he forced me to give him oral sex. And then he took my clothes off and he got on top of me and restrained me by my wrist and started raping me. And then he looked me in the face. His face changed, and he looked at me and he said, ""Let me tell you something. I don't like you, do you hear me? I don't like you."" VALENCIA: She says that she went immediately to the police after the incident and even went to the hospital the next day where a rape kit test was done. She says the results of that exam were never tested by police or the district attorney. Responding to the allegation, the district attorney's office told CNN that there were several reasons they declined to prosecute. They went on to say, ""Ethical rules prohibit the district attorney general's office from making extrajudicial statements about pending cases."" Ultimately CNN legal analyst Phil Holloway says the victims will have to prove that a culture of indifference existed at the University of Tennessee. PHIL HOLLOWAY, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: That creates this environment on campus that is hostile towards women and therefore treats women who are victims of sexual assault differently than it treats everybody else. VALENCIA: As for the university, it released a statement to CNN that read in part, ""In the situations identified in the lawsuit filed today, the university acted lawfully and in good faith, and we expect a court to agree. Any assertion that we do not take sexual assault seriously enough",0.0984115418245409,2016-02-13

At the same time, the vice president continued what is the new strategy of the White House and that is to try to reverse the president's downward slide in the polls and take its mostly Democratic critics head-on; those accusing the president of misrepresenting the facts and skewing the pre-war intelligence on Iraq. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DICK CHENEY (R), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Those who advocate a sudden withdrawal from Iraq should answer a few simple questions. Would the United States and other free nations be better off or worse off with Zarqawi, bin Laden, and Zawahiri in control of Iraq? Would we be safer or less safe with Iraq ruled by men intent on the destruction of our country? REP. JOHN MURTHA (D-PA): This war cannot be won militarily. We have to turn it over to the Iraqis. The Iraqis will let us fight this war forever. I'm convinced the only way it's going to be won is politically. (END VIDEO CLIP) KOPPEL: Obviously, a strong difference of opinion between John Murtha, there appearing on THE SITUATION ROOM, and this White House, Soledad. The White House is hoping that they will get a little bit of a break, at least for the next week or two on Iraq because of the Thanksgiving holiday. The president heading off to Crawford later this afternoon, Soledad. O'BRIEN: I bet they hope so. All right. Andrea Koppel for us this morning in Washington, D.C. Andrea, thanks. Rick? SANCHEZ: Here's a follow to that story. As the debate over Iraq rages here in the United States, Iraqi leaders are actually asking for a timetable for getting U.S. troops out of the country. But when will Iraqi troops be able to stand up on their own to defend their country? Let's go to Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson. He's live for us in Baghdad. Nic, what are you hearing from commandos there on the ground? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think one of the reasons -- if you look at that political decision in Cairo -- one of the reasons for that they want to try to include the Sunnis into the political process here. This is one of the things they've been demanding. Commanders here want to avoid getting dragged into how many troops are ready in the Iraqi army, when can the U.S. military pull out? What they say they want to do is build an army of quality. They say that all of the pieces are in the right place. There are enough bullets, enough helmets, enough flak jackets and enough guns getting out to the soldiers. What they want to is build up Iraqis' ability to finance that army in the long run; to draw up budgets for it, to look ahead to a five-year, 10-year plan and vision as they say. What they want is to produce a quality army special they say rushing it just isn't going to do that. (BEGIN VIDEO",0.5054970760233919,2005-11-22

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEMON: President Trump admitting in a speech tonight that he made up facts in a meeting with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Here to discuss, CNN political commentators Angela Rye and Scott Jennings, and Republican strategist Rick Wilson. Hello, everyone. ANGELA RYE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Hi, Don. LEMON: Rick, I'm going to start with you and this breaking news. The Washington Post is reporting that at a fund raise this evening, President Trump was bragging about a conversation he had with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during which President Trump, which was saying things about trade, deficits without knowing whether or not it was true. Are you surprised by this? 9 RICK WILSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Don, this is my not shocked face. I mean, this is a president who -- who has been known a time or two to exaggerate, gild the lily, open a spigot of lies and things he makes up in his head. He has got a really creative mental landscape about a lot of these things. This is just -- I'm totally unsurprised by this. LEMON: So, yes, he says I didn't know. I had no idea. I just said you're wrong. You know why, because we're so stupid and they're so smart. It just goes on and on. But the thing -- the fact is that he is admitting it, Scott. Shouldn't the president be better informed about whether there is a trade deficit without -- with our closest allies? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, of course he should. And that's one issue. The other issue of course is the fallout from a report like this which is now our closest allies and other conversations that we are having with them, the leaders of those countries will not know whether the president is speaking from facts or just from -- you know, posturing. And so that's something that his State Department, Mike Pompeo, will now have to deal with that. Actually, you know, the United States ambassador to Canada, she is a Kentuckian, where I am tonight, she is a great person. She will have to deal with that. I think about the relationships that we have with our allies like Canada. This is one of our closest economic and national security allies. And even though I think President Trump and Justin Trudeau don't see eye to eye politically, it would be better of course if we were dealing with honest conversations.

Also a body turns up in movie star Demi Moore's Beverly Hills swimming pool. The details straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CABRERA: We return to our top story: new disturbing revelations about comedian Bill Cosby. In a 2005 deposition Cosby admits to affairs with women in cities across the U.S. luring them with drugs and fame all while hiding it from his wife. Cosby's publicist tells CNN he has no comment. I asked Cosby accuser, Barbara Bowman about how she felt hearing this news. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBARA BOWMAN, COSBY ACCUSER: It's classic narcissistic psychopathic behavior. It's the ego. It's the control and the diabolical thinking and behaviors. It's classic and exactly what was perpetrated upon me. It's the smoke and mirrors. It's the reverse pointing the finger back at the victim, making us all wonder how did I just get raped? Why did that just happen? So to hear the words this morning, I, like everyone else, woke up and was blasted with the news. So I'm just digesting it as well. CABRERA: Do you feel this is vindication of sorts? I know when Andrea Constand had filed her lawsuit against Cosby, you were asked to testify but you didn't get a chance because she eventually settled in the case. How does this impact you now? BOWMAN: Well, it's amazing. I mean it's true vindication. And it is not just self-validating but it validates everyone that's involved in this. And it opens the door for communication to educate and to make aware of our younger people, our children of predatory behaviors. And you know the psychopathic and sociopathic behaviors and what happens is that sociopaths tend to not just try and divert the attention away from them as a way to protect them, but they have enablers and handlers and people. And they manipulate everyone around them to make their predatory behaviors possible and moreover, they begin to believe the lies that they're telling everyone else so that when they are in a position of being under oath or under pressure they actually believe what they're saying when it is completely untrue.

And at this stage we say, all right, he could easily become the nominee, probably most likely to become the Republican nominee at this point, but I think there's a better choice out there. BORGER: Who is it? ROMNEY: Well, Marco Rubio is the right person in Florida, John Kasich is the right person in Ohio. BORGER: Here we go. ROMNEY: And Ted Cruz is right anywhere where he's leading right now, or where he's closest to Donald Trump. BORGER: When are you going to choose one? ROMNEY: Well, it depends in part on how the process continues. I expect that after March 15, it may be clearer who is going to be the, if you will, the person who opposes Donald Trump most effectively. And so I would anticipate endorsing at that time. But let's say all three are doing about the same. BORGER: Right. Then what? ROMNEY: Well, then I'd probably encourage whoever's doing best in a particular state to get the support there and do that state by state. And that would lead to an open convention, where you'd see the delegates selected make the final decision. BORGER: So this contested convention, is this a scenario that you're actively looking at? ROMNEY: Oh, I think it's a realistic scenario. A lot of people have thought that for some time. BORGER: Likely? Likely? ROMNEY: You know, I think it's more likely than not that we will have a nominee before the convention that's Donald Trump. I think he has a much stronger shot of getting the 1,237 delegates than not. But, you know, the debate last night was not good for Donald Trump. He showed that he cracks under pressure and I think that may begin to open the door for some people who are looking for a different path. BORGER: Are you referring to a contested convention which has a first ballot, then people are unbound after that, second ballot? ROMNEY: Well, I'm going to begin by campaigning for people who I believe in and encouraging people to vote for folks who I think would be a better nominee than Donald Trump, but at a convention, sure, I'd be one of the people encouraging delegates to get behind someone who I thought could win in November. BORGER: If there is a contested convention would you allow your name to be put into nomination? ROMNEY: That's not going to happen. What's going to happen in a contested convention is that people who are running for president and who have delegates are going to be able to battle with one another.

1585608,1900751,CNN,Connect The World,"leave rally earlier on today. Let's get you some analysis now. Let's speak to Quentin Peel. He's an associate fellow at Chatham House, which is a think tank based here in London. And Quentin, a more muted atmosphere is how both these events were described today, perhaps understandable given the horrible events of last week. QUENTIN PEEL, CHATHAM HOUSE: Yes. I think this dreadful murder of Jo Cox, a bright young mother, just elected to parliament, very much on the remain side, very keen tostay in Europe, very pro-immigration and very pro- refugees. And her murder has really cast a shadow over this entire campaign. And I think it's made people worried that the increasingly emotional and really quite poisonous debate about immigration has been getting out of hand. That's a problem probably more for the Brexit side than it is for the remain side, because they've been playing immigration as their biggest card to get the voters to the polls. ANDERSON: So, I wonder then what you read into what Boris Johnson said at the leave rally today. He is amongst the loudest voices in the leave campaign, of course, and he's quoted as saying this earlier -- I am pro- immigration, my friends. I am the proud descendants of Turkish immigrants. Let me stun you, he said to the crowd, perhaps by saying I would go further, I'm not only pro-immigration, I'm pro-immigrant. I'm in favor of an amnesty for illegal immigrants. Given that we -- you've just been suggesting, this has been a highly contentious issue, immigration, and a tactic that has been used by the leave campaign. Is this a flip-flop on his behalf, or is this a canny politician playing to a wider audience than just his own? PEEL: I think it's a canny politicians. He's having it both ways. He has been consistent. I wouldn't -- Boris has always said I'm not against immigration as such. But he is the biggest figure, and the most popular figure, in a campaign which has made anti-immigration, controlling immigration, it's absolute top priority. They have the slogan, take back control. And by that they mean one thing: and that's control immigration. So Boris is really trying to have it both ways. ANDERSON: Talking about flip-flopping or whether a politician is just a canny politician, I want to read you something that the British prime minister said just a few months ago. I think you might have been in Davos at the World Economic Forum back in January. I remember him saying this, of course, he is effectively heading up the remain campaign. He said baci in January, quote, you're never going to hear me say that Britain couldn't succeed outside the European Union. Now this isn't exactly what he's saying now, is it? PEEL: No. ANDERSON: What's going on here? PEEL: You're talking two different audiences in a way.

208738,363599,CNN,CNN Live At Daybreak,"CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: Virginia and Tennessee, they are in the spotlight today, as Democrats vie for victories in the primaries. John Kerry is leading in the polls by a large margin. CNN's Bob Franken joins us live by phone from Fairfax, Virginia. Good morning -- Bob. BOB FRANKEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. As a matter of fact, we're on the campus of George Mason University, where Kerry expects to make his victory announcement this evening, expecting victories, as you pointed out, in both Virginia and Tennessee, and putting to rest, he hopes, the complaint that he hasn't proven he can win in the South, which, of course, he would if he ran tonight. COSTELLO: Well, that brings up this first question from one of our viewers for you, Bob. This is from James. He says: ""If John Kerry were to choose Jane Fonda as his vice president, wouldn't it bring together the core base of the Democratic Party?"" And I ask you -- I pass this question along to you partially in jest, because if Kerry can win in Virginia and Tennessee, will that prove he can successful, once and for all, combat his rather liberal image? FRANKEN: Well, I think that question may have been sent in by Jane Fonda. But the truth of the matter is that Kerry is going to have to probably prepare for a campaign, if he wins the nomination, where he's going to have to defend himself against Republican charges he's a liberal. Of course, he's planning to turn things around and make it a campaign against President Bush and the record of President Bush. But I'm going to make a prediction here that his vice presidential running mate will not be Jane Fonda. COSTELLO: I think you're probably right on that score. This question comes from Michael from Key West, Florida. He says: ""Candidates Edwards, Dean and Clark all say they'll stay in the race, even if they lose in Tennessee and Virginia. Does this help Senator Kerry by keeping the field divided, or hurt him?"" FRANKEN: Well, you know, it's an interesting question. The common wisdom, of course, is that the party needs to get together and come together against President Bush, and the sooner that that can be accomplished the better it is for the party. However, the polls are showing that President Bush has been really getting more and more troubled the longer the Democrats go; that there has been such high interest in the campaign that it has translated into a rise in the polls for Democrats and is one of the factors people believe in the decline in the polls for President Bush. So, maybe continuing this agitation might be helpful to the party, although, as I said, that goes against the conventional wisdom.

1474629,1789350,CNN,The Lead With Jake Tapper,"Bernie Sanders now seven points up on Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire. There's a key caveat here. This is among likely primary voters. It includes some independents. When you narrow the sample to just Democrats likely to vote in February, Clinton actually holds a slim edge, 43-39. CNN senior political correspondent Brianna Keilar in Washington with us. And, Brianna, you know, you still don't hear Bernie Sanders' name coming from Clinton's mouth on the campaign trail. But might we be hearing it from the super PAC supporting her soon? BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, it appears that we have, John, although it seems it may have been inadvertent. Hillary Clinton, you really notice this out on the trail, she hasn't really thrown an elbow at Bernie Sanders, who is really challenging her in the polls. She prefers to take on Republicans more than her Democratic opponents. But she has a number of super PACs that are supporting her, big super PACs. One of them called Correct the Record provided some opposition research, oppo, as it's called in political circles, about Bernie Sanders to The Huffington Post, and it paints Sanders as really extreme. It links him to the new British Labor leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who is a socialist. The Huffington Post reports that it notes Sanders' support for a deal with Venezuela and Hugo Chavez to provide heating oil to low-income New Englanders several years ago. As I understand it -- I mentioned this -- the PAC really didn't expect for this to become public and link back to them. I think they will be trying to operate behind the scenes, as they have done, but this did kind of come back to bite them. And it comes as Hillary Clinton, while not taking Sanders on directly, has said that she admits she's a moderate, the understanding there, John, which is unsaid, is that Sanders is not. And now Bernie Sanders fund-raising off of all of this, saying it's really what he'd expect from the Koch brothers, not from Hillary Clinton. BERMAN: So, Clinton herself seems pretty squarely focused on her potential opponents across the aisle, including Donald Trump. KEILAR: Yes, that's right. And this may be as she sort of operates in this general election sphere. She's also seeing in the polls she's lost her edge in these hypothetical head-to-head matchups with Republicans, not just Donald Trump, but also Jeb Bush and Ben Carson. And you see her taking on the Republican front-runner. She did it in Iowa with a little bit of an impersonation. Here was her shot at that.

He regretted it because it humanized him, he said. BRIGGS: That's right. ROMANS: Last night, in South Carolina, the President said Fallon looks like, quote, a lost soul. BRIGGS: Breaking overnight. At least a dozen people shot in Chicago in seven incidents. The victims include an 11-year-old boy and five teenagers. One person died. The violence comes after three people were killed and at least 36 people injured by gunfire this weekend. Chicago had seen a drop in violent crime in recent months, but there has been a spike since the weather warmed up as we see most summers. ROMANS: A southern California retirement home resident is in custody this morning, charged in the fatal shooting of a firefighter who was responding to a call about an explosion at that facility, Fire Captain Dave Rosa, a 17-year veteran of the Long Beach Fire Department. Police say the suspect, Thomas Kim, has been charged with murder, attempted murder, and arson. A second firefighter was also shot. He is in stable condition. Kim is being held on $2 million bail. Some 80 senior citizens living at the facility are being cared for by the city and community organizations. BRIGGS: Good Samaritans rushing to rescue a group stranded in a boat burning off the coast of Fort Lauderdale. Six people were on board the 45-foot charter when it caught fire early Monday.

Your colleague on the Biden Coronavirus Advisory Board, Loyce Pace, told me the other day that the President-elect Biden would get the vaccine the moment it's approved if Dr. Fauci recommended he do so. Dr. Fauci, of course, is going to be working with the President-elect. What has Dr. Fauci recommended? BRIGHT: I think Dr. Fauci is going to wait to see the discussion tomorrow. He's going to see all the details on the date on safety and efficacy. And he'll be paying close attention and I believe President- elect Biden said that once Dr. Fauci says that it is safe and effective, then he'll take the vaccine and I believe he'll follow through with that. BURNETT: So the Pfizer vaccine obviously is just the first of vaccine coming out. Pfizer and Moderna both using messenger RNA technology. There's another technology out there, the adenoviral vector which is used by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, very trusted name in the United States. Professor William Haseltine, has done groundbreaking research on HIV and AIDS and he told me last night, he would take the virus that is not an adenovirus vector. He doesn't feel confident with that one. He knows it's a controversial statement, but that's how he feels. Do you agree? BRIGHT: Erin, I think we need a variety of vaccines and some vaccines will work in different populations. And we clearly are already seeing that we have a shortage of the vaccines if we rely on only one manufacturer to make the vaccine. So that's all the more reason why we should continue to investigate a variety of vaccines. I believe if the science from the clinical studies, these large clinical studies show that the vaccine is safe and efficacious and it works and protects people from getting infected and getting severe illness, I don't think you should be worried about taking one of those vaccines that gone through such scientific rigor. I'm more concerned at this point of making sure that we get enough vaccine out to the people. It's a very complicated process to make vaccines and make enough of them to cover our population. It's going to take many months still to have enough vaccines and to vaccinate the people across our country. So we want to make sure that everyone is doing everything they can to wear their facemask and reduce the spread of the virus while we have to wait for the vaccines. BURNETT: All right. Rick Bright, I appreciate your time. Thank you very much. And when Rick is talking about the complicated process of distribution, it is that. That's an understatement in many ways. The Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at about minus 70 degrees Celsius. This makes it incredibly difficult to transport and very few places can store it. Omar Jimenez is OUTFRONT.

And as Marshall Cohen reports, he's report is widely expected to debunk yet another Trump conspiracy theory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: Dave and Amara, the highly-anticipated report from the inspector-general comes out today. We are expecting it will debunk major claims and conspiracy theories that President Trump has been peddling for years. First, we're told that the I.G. will conclude that the Russia investigation was properly launched in 2016 and that senior FBI officials for not acting out of bias against candidate Trump. Those findings undercut Trump's claims that the investigation was an illegitimate hoax designed to take him down. Also, the report is expected to say that the FBI did not implant spies in the Trump campaign. But we are expecting a mixed verdict of sorts when it comes to the court-approved surveillance of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. The report will say that the FBI had good reason to ask for those wiretaps. But there were problems and mistakes with how the warrants were prepared. CNN previously reported that an FBI lawyer was caught altering a document. And that is now part of a criminal investigation led by U.S. Attorney John Durham. Long story short, the report will give us some much-needed answers and debunk some conspiracy theories once and for all. But the fight will continue. CNN reported that Attorney General Bill Barr has already told allies that this report won't be the final word. Dave and Amara? (END VIDEOTAPE) WALKER: All right. Thank you for that.

So, you get back on the bus, you're back in New Orleans. The belt's back on, engine's running. You're on a plane now. And what? COMBS: Well, actually, they gave us a different bus, so we were on a whole other one, and we had to wait for it. BANFIELD: Wow. COMBS: But we get on a flight that's supposed to leave at 8:30, and I'm on my phone and not paying attention, and I look down at my watch and it's 9:30, it's 9:45. It's one hour and 15 minutes passed and we were supposed to leave. I couldn't find a stewardess, I didn't know what was going on. We finally took off and I didn't know what happened. But when I landed, Shelly (ph), one of my friends onboard said I can't believe it happened to us again. She was on the bus. She said it was an electrical problem and it caused the delay. It just -- you know, it's a domino effect, ship wrecked, the bus breaks, and then the plane goes down. So -- BANFIELD: And we've been looking at some of the pictures that you've been taking and the last we just saw of you outside the plane looking like you're having a whole bunch of fun with it -- were there some people who weren't quite as positive as you and were really angry after all this? COMBS: You know, I think each person on the ship had a different experience, and that caused certain reactions. I mean, some people had more flooding. Some people had more smoke. Some people had a really hard time. Maybe they were elderly and couldn't get up the stairs. So, that justified some of their response. But as I've said a couple times, you've got to find a way to be positive in that situation and look on the bright side or it's just going to become even more miserable for yourself and miserable for everyone around. So, I think that's the kind of policy I decided I was going to live with despite the horrible conditions. And there was lots of positives. The crew was amazing. They helped out hand and foot, all the time. There was nothing to complain about on that side. It's just there was too much to handle. BANFIELD: So let me ask you this, one of your fellow cruisers named Cassie Terry, maybe doesn't feel as positive as you do, and she's launched a federal suit against Carnival, and she's said that the conditions were horrifying. She was forced to wade through human waste, and she's now suing for physical and emotional harm, including anxiety, nervousness -- and this part, the loss of enjoyment of life. Do you back her?

CUOMO: It is a much more dangerous vote than the acquittal vote I think in any estimation because it shows you were afraid of the truth. Now, criticism for the process going forward. Why don't the Democrats just let this end? That's it. You're not going to get witnesses. You know they're going to acquit. Why do we have to spend days on this? DUCKWORTH: Well, we're not in charge of the process. That's the problem. This was Mitch McConnell's call. He decided to do this. And so we -- you know, this was an internal fight within the Republican Party. We had no say in this process whatsoever. And as you saw in the four votes that we took tonight, it's very partisan and very party line. CUOMO: It is now 64 troops have been affected by TBI after the shelling at that base in Iraq, of course done by Iran. The President said, I heard about the headaches. They're not as bad as a lot of the other injuries I've seen. What do you think of that? DUCKWORTH: I think the President is absolutely wrong in this case, and let me just say something about traumatic brain injury. It is the hidden wound of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 30 percent of the troops who served in Iraq, especially during the Battle for Fallujah, came home with traumatic brain injuries. These are lifelong injuries that will occur and will actually be compounded throughout these people's lives and our troops need to know that they need to go and get help. This is a real wound. And I cannot believe the Commander-in-Chief of our military would undermine literally years and years of hard work by veterans, advocates, medical professionals and the DoD itself in trying to make sure our troops get help for their wounds that they received in combat. CUOMO: Until you start balancing that interest against what looks good for him politically, and we see once again, even our fighting men and women, they will fall victim to being on the wrong side of the President's interest in this case. Senator Duckworth, thank you so much for doing this interview at such an important time. DUCKWORTH: Thanks for having me on. CUOMO: Senator Hirono, thank you for joining us. SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): Thank you. CUOMO: So when you go home and people say, why should I vote to put anybody in the Senate or in the House or in Congress?

So that when somebody gets arrested for domestic violence or violent crime, that that is immediately put into the system and then the disposition of that particular crime also has a huge effect. So I think there's got to be more of a relationship between the Department of Defense, the UCMJ, code of military justice, and what we have for our state, local and federal laws. BERMAN: There's got to be an appetite for it too. RODERICK: Right. BERMAN: I mean, the military, if you listen to what the military said they clearly want to find out what happened and they seem hell bent on making sure it doesn't happen again. When the president was asked about the purchasing of these guns today, though, it would have been easy for him to say this man should not have had a gun. RODERICK: Right, exactly. BERMAN: He didn't say that. RODERICK: Right. BERMAN: He talked about whether or not there should be different laws or stricter laws or preventing, you know, lawful citizens from owning guns. He did not say that this man who should not have had a gun legally shouldn't have had a gun. RODERICK: I mean the current laws we have with would have prevented this if there wasn't this -- I hate to say it a simple clerical error on the part of the Air Force Office of Special Investigation. BERMAN: The question is -- are the laws designed to work. You know could they be better designed to work better. RODERICK: They probably could be better designed. You're right. HARLOW: And need to be. And it's the least that we can all give to these families. RODERICK: You're right, Poppy. HARLOW: Of these 26 victims. Thank you, Art. RODERICK: Thank you. HARLOW: President Trump says tough talk on North Korea is beginning to work, and says Kim Jong-un's regime should come to the table. Also, it is Election Day in several states today.

I believe people have a right to say, even dreadful things so long as they're not direct threats and pure threats. But, you know, what Donald Trump has done I think is deeply irresponsible. He is an agent of division and I don't say that as an apology for Hillary Clinton. I'm not going to vote for Hillary Clinton. I would never vote for Hillary Clinton and I do think there have been unconscionable acts of left-wing violence in this election season. What we are facing right now is an election season that I think this is the worse since 1968. It's not as bad as 1968, thankfully, but it's the worse since 1968 and unless our political parties begin to get a handle on this and show real moral leadership, it could get even worse the next time around.

Does that mean that people are being targeted because they're anti-Trump people and their families are being threatened?

One is to read Joe Klein's book, ""Politics Lost,"" which is absolutely a great read. (CROSSTALK) ZIMMERMAN: It's an important book for both parties to read, because it does deal with the issue of finding your political soul and a real message. The other issue is not falling for these false choices that the administration is trying to get. Whether it was debating the gay marriage issue or flag burning, no one is advocating cut and run. But, the most effective message that the Democrats have, in response to Ed's point, is the fact that you need a Democratic Congress to provide the proper check and balances to hold this administration in check and to get the real answers as to how we're doing over there so we can have an exit strategy. ROLLINS: Yes, but Bob, you do have people like John Kerry calling for the near total withdrawal of all troops by the end of the year and that just isn't good policy. You know, you were asking for metrics before. There is one real test. And it's going to be, and this is the test that no one in the administration will talk about, but it's the real one. Are they going to be able to secure Baghdad in the next six months? If they can't, the war's over. It's lost. If they can, then there might be a hope to be able to succeed. ZIMMERMAN: Kerry's point is a very valid one though. The only time the Iraqi government ever responds is when they are given deadlines and that has proven time and time again. That's the strategy of John Kerry's statement. But the point is the Democratic party, through different proposals, is at least trying to advocate change and the Republicans are advocating status quo.

Described as both ruthless and charming, she was soon the youngest editor of ""The News of the World,"" and shortly after that, ""The Sun"" -- both owned by Murdoch's News International. She spearheaded a controversial campaign to, quote, ""name and shame"" alleged pedophiles, publishing their names and addresses in the paper. As the editor of ""The Sun,"" Brooks testified to parliament that her paper had paid police officers for information. And it was under her editorship that ""The News of the World"" allegedly paid a private investigator to hack into the voicemail messages of Milly Dowler, the 13-year-old girl murdered in Britain whose investigation and court case made front page headlines. Those allegations did not come to light until almost a decade later, after Brooks had scaled the corporate ladder to become chief executive of News International, a position she resigned last week. Brooks has denied having any knowledge of any phone hacking by her staff. It was Brooks who cemented a relationship with Prime Minister David Cameron, inviting him to lunches at her country home with the head of News Corporation Rupert Murdoch's son, James. There have been several arrests in the phone hacking scandal so far, but Rebekah Brooks is the highest profile yet, and the one closest to Rupert Murdoch himself. Atika Shubert, CNN, London.

What else is going on there, Chris? CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, an unofficial motto of the Marine Corps is to do more with less, and General John Allen is the first U.S. Marine to run the war in Afghanistan or Iraq. So if this latest killing is any indication at all, he's going to have to live up to that motto.

They are alleging that teams knowingly withheld information or told lies about the extent of the players' injuries to perpetuate their playing. If that is the fact, if that's proven, I have no knowledge of that, if someone can prove that, now you have not only damages, you have punitive damages, which will be extraordinary if someone can prove that. BERMAN: Thanks for bringing us back to that issue of fraud here. That's what is so stunning in this report. Players say they had broken bones and were flat out lied to about the extent of these injuries. How much do you think that actually went on? And the fact again, it's 30 years ago in some cases. If it did go on, why did players wait so long to do something about it? GREEN: Let's talk about why you would wait so long. Any time you have a personal injury claim, you want to defend it with deep pockets. The NFL's pockets continue to get deeper and deeper. I think there was a lot of awareness of the ability to sue the league with the concussion lawsuit. I think that's why. Fraud is a whole different animal. I never saw that. You wouldn't see it because if someone lied to you and you didn't challenge it, you would never know. I don't think that ever happened. I always saw a medical staff that was responsible and that wanted you to get back on the field, yes. Wanted to enable you to play with pain if they could give you a shot or painkillers where there was an injury that wouldn't lead to further dramatic damage. Then they wanted to help you. And players, that's what you wanted to do. You wanted to play even with pain. PEREIRA: Tim Green, we want to thank you for joining us @ THIS HOUR. We really appreciate your expertise.

A federal judge has thrown out the state's ban on same-sex weddings, saying Americans are better people than these laws represent. BERMAN: His ruling took effect immediately. The governor there is considering an appeal but the state's attorney general has said she will not challenge. So for now, add Pennsylvania to the list of states allowing same-sex couples to wed. The entire northeast, state after state. Our Jeffrey Toobin is here, an expert on all things legal and the courts and the Supreme Court, which matters here quite a great deal.

They may not necessarily tell the pollsters, they may not necessarily give every indication of how they're going to vote, but people don't want any part of this. And unless there's a more effective response to it, I think this is going to hurt the president badly in the last two weeks. BERMAN: Errol, Margaret, thank you both so much for being with us this morning. LOUIS: Thank you. ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Voters lining up in states across the country this weekend, 27 million ballots already cast. A preview of what's to come this week, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BERMAN: So as of this morning, more than 27 million votes have already been cast in the 2020 election. That's almost 20 percent of the total number of ballots cast in 2016. Fifteen days left to cast your vote. Over the weekend, a lot of people, you can see, lining up to vote in person. CNN's Kristen Holmes live in Washington with the very latest. Today, even more states allow in-person early voting. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. And this has been really incredible. As you say, we're still two weeks out from the election. And I want to show you some video here of the lines in the battleground state of Georgia over the weekend. They have seen 152 percent increase in turnout compared to this time in 2016. Now, as you said, there are six more states starting their early voting today. You've got Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, North Dakota, and Florida. All eyes are going to be on Florida. It's only 52 of the 67 counties that will start today, but, John, some of them are the most critical counties we always talk about at the election, Broward County, Miami-Dade, Duvall County. So at of eyes on that state today. BERMAN: And, Kristen, obviously, the president has been trying, I think, inappropriately, to raise questions about the integrity of the election. There's been no reports of mass fraud. Everything has run relatively smoothly at this point. But you have some new reporting on the Democrats' plans to make this clear. HOLMES: That's right, John. So we're looking at an umbrella here of two different scenarios that Democrats are preparing for. One is that President Trump disputes the results in court or on Capitol Hill. The other is that Biden wins, President Trump says it's a rigged election and he refuses a peaceful transfer of power. So, on the first front, that's legal, Capitol Hill, we know that the campaign has put out hundreds of lawyers all across the country. They are studying up on any sort of election law, including a scenario that looked like 2000 with Bush v. Gore, even though election experts say that's unlikely.

Whether it's not releasing his bundlers, not releasing his tax returns, taking the hard drives with him from Massachusetts, all of these things -- trying to close his fundraisers even on the European trip -- all of these things prevent enormous transparency problems for Mitt Romney. (CROSSTALK) CUTTER: So this is a politically charged attack and I don't think it will change anything -- do anything to distract from his problem. CROWLEY: Right. Even if the folks on the House side saw a way this might help Mitt Romney, it doesn't mean that what they're looking at isn't true and that's what I was just trying to get at was is it a fairly common practice to end up doing business on personal e-mail accounts -- CUTTER: It's not a common practice to do business on personal e-mail accounts. But if you have a friend on the outside who is used to corresponding with you on your personal e-mail address, every now and then it does happen. And as I said, we are instructed to forward that into the White House system if it's official business and that's what we do. CROWLEY: Let me turn you to some polls that came out today in Ohio and Florida, it's a Quinnipiac (ph) poll which largely show the president ahead both in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania I should add. But inside the polls there is this number. Who do you think would do a better job on the economy? In Florida, the president 45, Mitt Romney 47, Ohio, the president 46, Mitt Romney 45. Essentially that's a tie. Why do you think that is? CUTTER: Why do I think it's a tie between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama and who would be better on the economy? CROWLEY: Why do you think -- yes -- why do you think when voters say -- when voters are asked who would do better on the economy that basically they see very little difference between the two of them? CUTTER: Well, I think for several reasons. And as you know, that's been Mitt Romney's advantage in this race for a very long time because of central premise of his candidacy has been his business experience and how that would qualify him to turn around the economy. I think voters are waking up and realizing that's not true. They're realizing what that business experience was about. It wasn't about creating jobs. It was about creating wealth for himself and other investors and that came with real consequences for working people and for communities. So I think voters are starting to become more aware of what that experience is. And I also think the other thing in those polls, Candy that I found interesting was that, you know, a majority in both states that you mentioned believe that the president's policies either are working to improve the economy or will work in the future.

It's not yet clear whether he is the same Saif al-Adel who once led al Qaeda and was indicted for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa. Mitt Romney has cemented his status as a frontrunner for the U.S. Republican presidential nomination. He won both the Arizona and Michigan primaries on Tuesday. The race was close in Michigan, but Romney cruised to victory in Arizona with a lead of some 20 percentage points over main rival Rick Santorum. The captain and second officer of a container ship that ran aground last year off New Zealand's east coast has pleaded guilty to a range of charges. Those include operating a vessel in a dangerous manner, discharging harmful substances, and subverting the course of justice by altering ship documents. The two Filipino men will be sentenced in May. More than two dozen alleged members of the hacking group known as Anonymous have been arrested. Interpol led the crackdown and immediately felt the consequences on its own web site. Atika Shubert is in our London studio with the details. So Atika, what happened here? ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: No, it didn't take very long for payback to come. Basically Interpol announced that the arrest had been made in Argentina, Spain, Chile, and Colombia. And then very shortly afterwards their web site went down. Now the hacker group Anonymous claimed responsibility for bringing down their website. Interpol had made no comment on who may have been responsible. But this is certainly the modus operandi of Anonymous. This is normally how they operate. When they feel that they are begin attack in some way they will basically come back with a response like this. In terms of the arrests, what we know is that they spanned several countries. It seems to be sort of a Latin American led operation across these different countries. We don't know exactly that many details about the individual arrests. We do know that one of them was a 16-year-old girl and that these arrests were made in connection to denial of service attacks on Chilean and Colombian websites. This is, of course, an attack in which a website is overwhelmed and then it shuts it down. So this is what it seems to be about. But again trying to define exactly who is a member of Anonymous, or how Anonymous works is very difficult, because as you know it's basically a hackivist collective. Anybody can join Anonymous. And anybody can become their target. They're very amorphous and trying to pin down the exact links is going to be very difficult. TANK: Well, clearly these arrests show the fact that Anonymous is making a lot of people around the world very nervous partly because it is this kind of organization that has these tentacles and seemingly quite a bit of power.",0.203996983408748,2012-02-29

The Labor Department says new unemployment claims officially fell below 300,000 last week. That is the lowest they have been since the start of the pandemic. Still, big problems remain. Look at this list of economic pressures facing the country right now. Americans are paying more for just about everything. Gasoline prices, for example, are up dramatically over the past year. And they are still rising. A gallon of gas today costs on average 6 cents more than it did just last week, this as nationwide labor strikes are now threatening everything from Netflix to Frosted Flakes. More on that in just a moment. If all that's not enough, the global supply chain nightmare is further complicating the U.S. economic picture. And CNN's Amara Walker is in Savannah, Georgia, where ships are now waiting up to a week to unload their cargo. Amara, something has got to give. What's the plan? AMARA WALKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, talk about a major traffic jam and a major backlog. So, here at the Port of Savannah, that supply chain nightmare you're talking about is on full display. Just look over my right shoulder here, you see a wall of shipping containers stacked about five stories high. We're talking about 70,000 to 80,000 of these steel boxes just waiting to be taken to their final destination, whether it be store shelves or factories. The Georgia Ports Authority tells me they are at capacity here. Also, 25 cargo ships right now are in the queue anchored out at sea waiting to get support, many of them waiting up to five days. Why is this happening? There's several factors to take into account. First off, the Georgia Ports Authority tells you that they have experienced a 25 increase in demand for goods so far this year compared to the same time period last year. Of course, that's overwhelming the supply chain. We're seeing that everywhere. Not enough truck drivers. And, of course, that's forcing some retailers to not pick up their goods for several weeks at a time. So, the Georgia Ports Authority overall is saying, look, we are making good progress operationally, things are moving along. When will all this end? Look, nobody knows.

The facts are that al Qaeda terrorists killed Americans on 9/11, they're fighting us in Iraq and across the world, and they are plotting to kill Americans here at home again. Those who justify withdrawing our troops from Iraq by denying the threat of Al Qaeda in Iraq and its ties to Osama bin Laden ignore the clear consequences of such a retreat.

What's your viewpoint? LA MONICA: Yeah. Yeah, these are very lofty goals, Julia, and I think that for the time being, when you see how Beijing and, you know, President Xi, they are really trying to exert more control over some of these rapidly growing Chinese companies. It's not something that is exclusive to Alibaba. You have concerns about what this means for Baidu, what does this mean for Tencent, potentially for ByteDance which owns TikTok.

That view rejected by the World Health Organization, which does advise pregnant women to avoid the Olympics entirely because of the risk of severe deformities to unborn children.

So the first thing they can do, they could let British investigators see Alexander's friend, Mr. Mikael Triposhkin (ph), another former... S. O'BRIEN: Who's he? GOLDFARB: He's another former KGB agent who's serving a term for disclosing official secrets, and who smuggled two letters a few days ago from prison which came to London and are in possession of the Scotland Yard, which actually names a unit within the FSB, which, in his view, was responsible for this assassination.

To give you an idea how close they are to the beach, we have another camera set up looking at the sunrise.

Well, you would never guess from seeing Michael Jackson rehearse in this just-released video that two days later he'd suffer cardiac arrest and die. CNN was the first TV network to air this clip of Jackson singing and dancing at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on June 23rd. Watch and listen for yourself to Jackson performing ""They Don't Care About Us,"" a song from his ""History"" album. (MUSIC) MALVEAUX: Amazing video. Our CNN contributor Hilary Rosen is standing by to talk about this. She is the former head of the Recording Industry Association of America. Right now we want to bring in our CNN Ted Rowlands, who is at the Neverland Ranch with the breaking news on a Jackson memorial service and the investigation into his death. What have we learned this afternoon? TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Suzanne, we've learned that the plans for this public service, which at first we were told there were plans to have it here, the plans are now set for the Staples Center on Tuesday of next week, the Staples Center in Los Angeles. This is where the Los Angeles Lakers play, a 20,000-seat venue there. That is where the family is going to have what they're calling a tribute, a public tribute for Michael Jackson. The public will be invited inside the Staples Center. And then outside the Staples Center, we are told, there will be some big-screen televisions, projections for the folks that can't get in. They can also take part. MALVEAUX: And Ted, what is the latest on his trust? ROWLANDS: Well, the public document that was filed on the will that surfaced in this case basically said that all of the money from the estate goes into this Michael Jackson living -- or family trust. What we've been able to find out through a source are the specifics of what does that mean, who's in this trust? Well, Katherine Jackson, Michael's mother, is -- represents 40 percent of that in a life estate. Basically, when she dies, her interest goes automatically to the children. The other 40 is to the children, and then the remaining 20 percent is to charitable contributions. But it's interesting. Jackson did not designate which charities. It said that would be up to the executors of his will. So that will be a big question. A lot of charities, of course, would love a donation, which",0.9781674053698812,2009-07-02

And she`s going to keep think both sides are going to continue fighting. BECK: Would you do that? If you were the mom, would you be doing that? Or would you... BLOOM: I`ll tell you something. There`s a difference when your children become adults. You have to let them go. You have to let them make their own choices. Anna Nicole went to the Bahamas. She buried her son there. Her mother wants her to be in Texas because that`s where her mother lives. But Anna Nicole was a grown woman. She may have been a drug addict. She may have made bad choices, but you have to respect her wishes, I think, even in death. That`s what I would say to her mother. BECK: I`ve got to tell you, I want to check the world record book. I really do. Because you know, they still haven`t -- I could be mistaken on this, but I don`t think I am. They still haven`t buried James Brown. BLOOM: I know. BECK: Are we going for some sort of a record on how long we can leave people unburied? BLOOM: And it`s really sad. I mean, tomorrow is three weeks Anna Nicole, since she died and she`s still not buried. We know from the medical examiner she`s decomposing. I mean, we`re really disrespecting her at this point.

Now, I just have to ask, first of all, New York, symbolically can we stop with the symbolism? Either do something real or shut the pie hole, because I can`t take it. Secondly, when did we get into the banning of anything in this country? Can`t we just all agree that, whether you`re black or white, the ""N"" word should never be said by anyone, not under the guise of free speech and definitely not in some crappy rap song.

AMANPOUR: President Karzai, do you think that the U.S. surge will finish the job in your country? KARZAI: Well, the -- the most important element in the new U.S. strategy on Afghanistan is concentration on protecting the population, and doubling economic assistance to Afghanistan, and also concentrating on the regional aspect of the problem. So as far as Afghanistan is concerned, Afghanistan welcomes this new strategy, and Afghanistan will do all it can to be a good partner in it. AMANPOUR: Do you think that -- although the president has concentrated on defeating Al Qaida and preventing it to come back, they're not saying they want to defeat the Taliban. Do you think the Taliban needs to be defeated? KARZAI: Well, those Taliban who are part of Al Qaida, who are part of the terrorist networks, who are organized from outside against Afghanistan, in association with terrorist networks, of course they need to be defeated with those terrorist networks. But the thousands of Taliban, the majority of them who have no such ideological linkage with the terrorist networks, they are part of our people. They must be reintegrated into the Afghan society.

They have a whole host of equipment that is really more appropriate for a war zone than it is for a small town policing. GORANI: And what impact is this having in an already very tense situation like the one unfolding in Ferguson? BOUIE: So what I think it does -- and this is my observation looking at yesterday's events -- is that when there are just regular police who have their riot shields and stun batons, like the usually equipment, there's some tension. But it's not exacerbated. When you bring in the armored cars and you bring in the rifles, I sat and watched snipers from the top of armored cars, train their sights on demonstrators. When that happens and when people see it happen, it agitates them. Completely reasonably. I don't think there's anyone really who could experience and not come away from it a little shaken. And what it does is agitates and makes people less likely to listen, make people want to confront and then it leads to situations where the police feel like they have to use tear gas and use rubber bullets, which is a completely disproportionate response to what was a very peaceful demonstration. GORANI: And some of the things we've been seeing circulated, especially on social media, among other things, video of a ""Washington Post""",0.3303619408882566,2014-08-14

This is how he describes what went on last night during this flight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN CURLEE, PASSENGER ON DIVERTED DELTA FLIGHT: And my first interaction was when the intercom came on, and apparently, the perpetrator was on the intercom and was telling passengers to return to their seat because oxygen masks were going to be required of them. And that created quite a stir amongst everyone around us and became very tense. (END VIDEO CLIP) SANDOVAL (on camera): That's one of the many statements that investigators right now are going over right now. Delta did release a statement regarding Delta Flight 1730, saying that basically, thanking not only the crew but also the passengers aboard that flight who assisted in detaining an unruly passenger as the flight was diverted to Oklahoma City. Delta goes on to say the aircraft landed without incident and the passenger was removed by law enforcement. We should mention that flight was then allowed to continue the rest of its itinerary all the way to Atlanta. But look, this is just the latest among a long list of cases that we have seen. The FAA track those numbers and reported that they've already seen at least 2,900 similar cases here. In fact, about 2,200 of those, Fred, that has to do with passengers that refuse to comply with the federal mandate that still in place, requiring people wear masks while traveling on airplanes, according to -- you know, because of the pandemic. WHITFIELD: Yes. SANDOVAL: So, it's certainly making things a bit more complicated, especially as airlines are trying to get back off the ground after the -- a very rough 2020. WHITFIELD: Yes, but this is a very different distinction because it's -- you know what -- it's hard to believe what you said is that, that unruly passenger has now been described as an off-duty flight attendant for Delta airlines. So, that person -- (CROSSTALK) SANDOVAL: That's correct. WHITFIELD: The I.D. has not been revealed publicly, but that, too, makes this story even that much more astounding. Polo Sandoval, thank you so much. Appreciate it. SANDOVAL: Thank you, Fred. WHITFIELD: All right, straight ahead, Congressman Adam Schiff is calling it a terrible abuse of power. An investigation launched after the Trump justice department issues secret subpoenas. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WHITFIELD: All right, the U.S. Justice Department's inspector general has launched an investigation into whether the Trump administration abused its power going after Donald Trump's perceived enemies. This coming as we are learning new details about former Attorney General William Barr's role in the Trump administration's targeting of Democratic members of Congress. Sources tell CNN Barr pushed investigators to finish probes that included secret subpoenas on House Democrats, their staff, and family members. The White House is now responding to the reports.

And there is jubilation inside a helicopter once 15 hostages find out they are being rescued from rebels, the Colombian government released this video showing the emotional flight to freedom. The hostage holders were tricked into giving up their captives. And three of the freed hostages are Americans. They haven't talked publicly but promise they will. In a statement the men say: ""We understand that a lot of people are eager to see and hear from us, and they will. But right now more than anything, we just want to be with our loved ones. We ask that the media respect our privacy as we reunite with our families."" President Bush is heading to Japan at this hour for his final summit of G8 members. The talks are expected to focus on the slowing global economy, soaring oil and gas prices, and food shortages in the developing world. And Iran is saying its nuclear program remains unchanged, indicating it has no plans to meet a key Western demand to stop enriching uranium. A government spokesman says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only. The U.S. and Western allies believe Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons.

I'm Ali Velshi. According to a CNN/Opinion Research poll out this week, 93 percent of voters say the economy is extremely or very important to their vote for president this November and that's probably because we're halfway through 2008 and things aren't looking so hot. The markets are down double digits. The price of oil has risen about 50 percent since the beginning of the year. And the housing market is showing very few signs of thawing out. So we brought our good friend Stephen Leeb, the president of Leeb Capital Management here to tell us whether the glass is half full or half empty for the rest of 2008 and beyond. Stephen, great to see you. I think you are generally a half full kind of guy in life. STEPHEN LEEB, PRESIDENT, LEEB CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I am, I am. VELSHI: But this economy we're in with housing, with inflation, with energy prices and with the stock market, would even challenge an optimist like you. LEEB: Well, Ali, at first glance, but given all of these bad things: high oil prices, this credit crisis, everything else, the economy, though it's not moving ahead in a rapid way, it's not really falling apart either. I mean, a lot of the very hard numbers, unemployment insurance claims, the people getting laid off, they've risen but they haven't risen that much.",0.299756335282651,2008-07-05

And in a decade like the 1990s where so much of our productivity growth came from innovation we saw both terrific productivity growth and great job growth. The problem is in the last decade, it was more efficiency driven and not so much innovation. ZAKARIA: Byron, that's a fascinating introduction. Coming right up, we're going to dissect the jobs crisis with some of the most influential leaders in the business world. We'll ask CEOs how they plan to create jobs. Some of their solutions will surprise you. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ZAKARIA: Today's jobs crisis is decades in the making. But in an election year, voters won't be swayed by a history lesson. They want jobs, and they want them now. Nothing less than the fate of Barack Obama's presidency will depend on his ability to create those jobs. And he's counting on one man in particular to help him. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IMMELT: We don't want to see the country the way it is right now. You know, we want to be part of the solution. We want to hire people where it makes sense. We want to hire them in the U.S. where it makes sense. ZAKARIA (voice-over): Jeff Immelt is the president's job czar. The chairman of his Council on Jobs and Competiveness, a group of fortune 500 executives and other private sector advisers. Immelt's day job, of course, is chairman and CEO of General Electric. Since he was chosen to lead the jobs council earlier this year, Immelt has presented a host of ideas to the president. (On camera): What is it like working with President Obama? IMMELT: He's a good listener. He's tough minded. You know I tell my colleagues in the business community, it's not like your first shot on goal is going to get through his pads, right? ZAKARIA: You know a lot of people in the business community think he's anti-capitalist or he's too left wing to be president. You see him. You talk to him about capitalism, jobs, the economy all the time. IMMELT: Look, I know he cares deeply about job creation. I know he cares deeply about the United States. Do I agree with everything that the president says or everything he stands for? Probably not. In fact, definitely no. But at the same time, you know, he's my president. And I believe when the president asks you to do something, you say yes.

You say OK, well, my kids are alive, but there are a lot of families out there today who are not so lucky. SANCHEZ: You know, all psychologists would tell you that the guilt is somewhat normal.

In Summit, Alabama, Mr. Bush toured Enterprise High School, where eight students died when a twister roared right through on Thursday. And then it was on to Americus, Georgia, where two people died and hundreds of homes were either damaged or destroyed. Mr. Bush implored private citizens to help the victims somehow rebuild. CNN's Alan Chernoff witnessed the president's roll through Americus. But we're going to start our coverage back in his first stop.

And I don't even know what this is, Rick. We'll look up here. I don't know where this came from or what this is, but can you imagine what it would have been like if the kids had been in the classrooms? They weren't in the classrooms.

They've been practicing great community-oriented policing. But there are communities that still struggle with that concept. And you're absolutely right: in light of everything that's going on right now, every leadership, from elected officials, to appointed physicians, rather their chiefs, sheriffs, whatever the case may be, we all should be working very hard, very diligently right now, working with our communities.

Trump in light of all these revelations that continue to come up, particularly in the light of the James Comey memos suggesting that the president may have tried to interfere in a Michael Flynn investigation. Today, there was a softening among some Republicans in their opposition to special prosecutor and a lot even the members of the leadership are raising concerns about the Comey memo, and saying that there needs to be some investigation to get to the facts.

Governor Huckabee already tweeting, ""Afghanistan was the launching pad for the 9/11 attacks and the American people deserve justice, dignity and closure."" He's jumping on it. I'm sure, Peter, others will as well. A way to spin this? BEINART: Yes, although it's interesting, you actually don't hear very much. You haven't heard so much - so far in the campaign a lot about Afghanistan. It's kind of a forgotten war. BALDWIN: We thought they'd mention it in the debate and - BEINART: Right, much, much more about Iran, much, much more about ISIS. I think the Republicans will probably applaud this move - BALDWIN: Yes. BEINART: While criticizing Obama for things he did in the past. But the reality is, there's not the stomach in the country for a larger, more aggressive policy in Afghanistan and that's why the Republicans aren't going to advocate one. BALDWIN: Peter Beinart, thank you so much. BEINART: Thank you, Brooke. BALDWIN: And Lieutenant Colonel Scott Man, I appreciate you as well. Thank you both. MAN: Thanks for having me.

Also, we are one week away from the Benghazi hearing. Now another Republican congressman says that committee was designed to target Hillary Clinton, to take her down. Also, 911 calls take us inside those frantic moments when former NBA and reality star Lamar Odom was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel.

And yet, there was never actually evidence to support the fact that they were there. BERMAN: You use the phrase ""craft the narrative"" -- a phrase that she has used to cultivate authenticity, which is why the process of reporting this to me was so interesting. She would not speak to you on the record, really, in-depth. But you did talk to the president. And when you were in the Oval Office interviewing the president, Ivanka Trump just happens, coincidentally, to wander in with news about jobs. Explain that moment. PLOTT: It's a Tuesday around 4:30. The president and I are wrapping up our interview. I think we're on maybe our second to last question and then all of the sudden he just -- he looks up and he's clearly really excited. And I didn't even have to turn around to know who it was but, of course, it was Ivanka. And she just feigned such shock. She said I was just coming by. I forgot you guys were doing this. But, you know, I just had to tell the president that Siemens just added 75,000 more jobs to our Workforce Development Program. So, of course, very conveniently timed. But it spins out a kind of brand that she's worked meticulously at her whole life. When you're somebody who does run a lifestyle brand you're always trying to perfect the facade or the look of a carefree, easy life even when that's not actually the case. BERMAN: Two more things I want to get into very quickly. One is a statement from Matt Bevin, the governor of Kentucky, just to make the point here that Ivanka Trump seems to be criticized from either side, no matter what. The ""Kentucky governor, who has worked closely with her on workforce development, told me, 'Ivanka could literally save an elderly woman from getting hit by a train and the people would blame her for disrupting the travel time.'"" So there are those who defend her. And just very quickly, the last story. You were in her office speaking to her off-the-record and you noticed a book about Burning Man, right? Now I am told reliably by Alisyn Camerota, Burning Man is where you go to smoke pot -- CAMEROTA: Smoke pot. BERMAN: -- and hallucinogens, acid, and listen to music, so Alisyn says. CAMEROTA: According to me. BERMAN: So what was the significance of that book in Ivanka Trump's office?

How did it all begin, Jonny? It was an idea formulate Friday a fellow Aussie, right? MCGIRR: That's right. We lost one of our firefighters last year in a big wildfire in Victoria, and he left behind three children and a fantastic wife. And he actually called up and said let's do a run from the Cambre, which is the capital to Melbourne (ph). It was really successful, and it brought a lot of comfort to his family. And during that, he just thought in Australia we were affected by 9/11. And he said, how about we do this for the Americans and just try to do something with goodwill? And that's how it began. PHILLIPS: Wow. That's amazing. And Kevin, what do you think of how this started overseas? Now you have come together. This created quite a bond among you guys, yes? O'CONNOR: I would say so. The emergency service is a brotherhood, and this trip has really shown across our nation and across the sea how much we all have a common goal and we can come together and do an event such like this. It has been really, really incredible. PHILLIPS: And Johnny, what do you think of how people have turned out from state to state? I mean, give us an idea of how people reacted to all of you.

The attacks in a remote mountains of the Khost province were aimed at militants helping the movements of foreign fighters. The U.S. military says the air strikes also destroyed two command bunkers. And I want to tell you about this. A car bomb exploded outside a hotel today in the province of Pakistan. Police say four people were killed and six others wounded. You can see the area right there on the map. The bombing is the latest in a string of attacks on civilian targets across Pakistan. The attacks come in the wake of the military's operation against Taliban militants in the country's Northwest. A Taliban faction in that region announced today that it has pulled out of a peace deal with the government leading to concerns of more violence. The French Navy sending ships and a plane to help look for more survivors from a plane crash. And we've been told today that a young child was plucked from the Indian Ocean today after a Yemeni jetliner went down. The plane had more than 150 people onboard. It was flying from Yemen's capital to the capital of Kormos just last night. Officials say the Airbus A-310 landed, at least tried to land in Maronis Airport but could not. So it made a U-turn before it crashed. The crash is the second involving an Airbus jet this month. The crash of an Airbus A-330 off Brazil still under investigation. The deposed president of Honduras says he is coming home to retake power. Violence followed the ouster of the democratically- elected President Manuel Zelaya. He was force into exile, that was pretty dramatic and a general strike was called for today. Zelaya is expected to be in New York today to appeal the United Nations for some help. He's already announced a plan to return to Honduras on Thursday to re-take control. And coming up in about 20 minutes, we're going to talk to an expert on Latin American human rights. I'm going to ask her what impact this coup could have on the United States. Well, the economy is issue number one, and today we have some more mixed news on what may be your biggest investment.

And Israel can play and must play an important part of the development of a Palestinian state. At the same time, it's essential that the Palestinian leadership consolidate security forces so that they can fight off those few who still have the desire to destroy Israel as a part of their philosophy and those few who fear there to be a free vote amongst the Palestinian people.

President Bush now saying the United States going into second phase of trying to help millions hurt by the tsunami crisis two weeks ago. Also in commenting about the election of Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, he congratulated him. Also said he hopes to see him soon at the White House. That's big difference, of course, since the previous leader, Yasser Arafat, did not have that kind of invitation from President Bush.

The partnership that we announced today between UNICEF and the Clinton Foundation is really a continuation of the work we are already doing together with our foundations, HIV and AIDS initiative, which has been run by our magaziner (ph), who is also here today. When I was asked to undertake this effort with former President Bush, I knew that a lot of money had been given, an enormous amount of supplies had been given, but I tried to determine whether there was any area of critical need where as far as we could determine the funds were insufficient to meet not only the immediate, but the medium and longer-term needs. And our inquiries determined that in the weeks and months ahead, more resources will be needed to provide clean water and adequate sanitation, both for survival and for the prevention of disease. Diseases such as dysentery and diarrhea accompany the absence of clean water, the presence of polluted water. KAGAN: We've been listening a bit here to former President Bill Clinton, announcing more efforts to help those who have been hit by the tsunami and the need to help in trying to keep up with public health, as he was mentioning, sanitation and clean water, the most basic needs, especially trying to help the children of the world.

And these guys are trained for water landings. He made a water landing. There's obviously a million things that could have gone wrong, but he made sure they didn't, and they didn't. (CROSSTALK) MYERS: You don't really practice, though. SANCHEZ: Yes, you're right. MYERS: I mean, OK, you get in a simulator. But you can't really say, OK, let's take the plane into the water today and see how it goes. They left out 040 out of La Guardia like a normal takeoff, banking left, then heading back down. You want to miss all the buildings. They don't fly around Manhattan. They fly around Manhattan and then down usually on the Jersey side here of the Hudson. At 3,200 feet, that's as high as the plane got, then it started losing altitude. And then at that point, it was almost -- I have heard some people say there were just -- there were no noises coming out of these engines at all, so almost a dead stick landing. Like, he doesn't even have control. He can't add power. He can't take power off. But the flaps went down, slowed the plane down, and landed it as slowly as he could get it on the ground -- get it on the water. What you don't really notice, and we didn't hear anything about this, a dangerous part of a water landing, that right there. If you get -- those engines get to be sucked into that water, there can be so much torque, you can take the wings off the plane. SANCHEZ: Yes. MYERS: That did not happen, because as we have been hearing, he came down on the back part of the plane long enough that those engines didn't get into the water until it was just a couple miles per hour slower than it would have if it was just a flat pancake into the water. One more thing I noticed, Rick, I think this might be the most under-told story of the day, there was no ice chunks in the river. SANCHEZ: Yes. MYERS: Had there been large chunks of 12-, 14-inch sheets of ice floating down the river, like there will be in a couple of weeks, the plane very well may have broken up because it did not have that nice smooth landing.

Tonight, a SHOWBIZ special report, the dark side of comedy. It`s not all laughs in the comedy world. In fact, some of the funniest people, like robin Williams and Jim Carey, have struggled with troubled past and they are just two examples of many comics whose real life stories are no laughing matter. Tonight, we`re investigating the dark side of comedy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBIN WILLIAMS, COMEDIAN: Oh, no, say it ain`t so, Joe. ANDERSON (voice-over): Robin Williams. Roseanne Barr, Jim Carey, they are all talented comedians who have battled depression. PINKSY: The funniest people in the world tend to be the most unhappy. ANDERSON: Dr. Drew Pinsky conducted the first-ever study of celebrities and mental illness. PINSKY: We`re happy to be around them. We like what they do for us. We feed them to a certain extent. But the reality is that pseudo-intimacy we establish with a comedian as an audience is really not enough to feed their emptiness and make them healthy. JOHN HENSON, COMEDIAN: I think there is a dark side of comedy. ANDERSON: Comedian John Henson tells SHOWBIZ TONIGHT his 20 years as a comic opened his eyes to a surprising reality. HENSON: Stand-ups tend to bathe themselves in that attention. When you`re on the road, sometimes you`re alone 22, 23 hours a day. Then you`re in front of 500, 1,000, 2,500 people that night all laughing and the center of attention for an hour and then back into sort of a world of isolation, it`s a strange lifestyle.

It sounds rather -- I mean, it sort of sounds worthy of investigation by the FBI in the beginning. PELOSI: Well, let me say this: Whatever the charges, and Wen Ho Lee is innocent until proven guilty, what the conditions were of his arrest were extraordinary. He was in solitary confinement. He could not speak Chinese to his family. He could exercise. He was not eligible for bail. Earlier this year, when the attorney general came to San Francisco for a pre-planned meeting on -- by -- of questions diversity, many in our Asian-American community delivered a petition to her asking that his conditions of incarceration be improved and that he be considered for bail. So whatever the charges, and whatever the weight of evidence, it was unusual that he would be held under the conditions that he was. And we have the question why. And I will talk more about racial profiling if you want me to but... COSSACK: We will come to that. Senator Grassley, let me follow up with a question to you. One of the things that I find disturbing in this case is this notion that you have a federal judge castigating the prosecution in this case. And then you have the president of the United States saying that he too is concerned what appears to be the way this case was handled. And yet you have very little, if any, response it seems to me from the heads of these departments in terms of a responsiveness to the American public. After all, you know, it is us that we are talking about. That notion of this lack of responsiveness, this: I'm not apologizing for anything; is that what your group is looking into also, sir? GRASSLEY: Well, I think here at the higher level, you've got the president of the United States, in his news conference, saying about: They did this, and they did that, and they did something else, you know, always saying he kind of disagreed or had questions about what was going on. And I think the president ought to remember that the buck stops, he's the follower of Harry Truman and that's what Harry Truman said: The buck stops at that time president's desk. The president has to take some responsibility for this because, when he talks about they, he's the chief ""they,"" he's in charge of everything. Now, beyond that, though, following on what the congresswoman has said, I think we have a double standard here. I think you have an instance where the Justice Department was not going to investigate John Deutch, he's a congenital downloader, and in the process, now that the Wen Ho Lee case has fallen through for the Justice Department, they are going back to John Deutch. But John Deutch is not shackled and being deprived of any civil rights right at this particular case. COSSACK: All right, let's",0.378690690085582,2000-09-26

Police tonight say the gunman, Cho Seung- Hui, was a South Korean with a green card living here as a legal permanent resident. He left a rambling message in his dorm room. Police say it`s not a suicide note. They describe it as anti-woman and anti-rich kid. The note reportedly said you caused me to do this.

MIKE BROOKS: Well, Nancy, you know, on the identifying of the victims, it`s very important that their next of kin be notified.

And nearly 1.2 million Americans have filed for unemployment for the first time last week. Let's get the response from CNN chief business correspondent Christine Romans. So this is better/worse than expected? CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It's a little bit better, but just the sheer volume of this job crisis, it's just hard to find any silver linings here. And 1.2 million people for the very first time filed for unemployment benefits last week. We are now on a 20-week trend where more than 55 million people have filed for the first time for unemployment benefits. When you look into these numbers, you can just see the volume of the pandemic recession job crisis. There are right now 32 -- more than 32 million people receiving some sort of benefit, jobless benefit from the government. That number is just unprecedented. And it really shines a light on those negotiations happening in Washington because just last week the $600 a week extra in unemployment benefits disappeared for people and you can see the jobs have not been coming back yet. So this is a really big, long-term problem that we have here that is an emergency, quite frankly, a jobs emergency that Congress is going to have to tackle soon. CAMEROTA: Fifty-five million people.

And just minutes from now, President Obama will set tough new standards for school lunches for about 31 million kids to help daily requirements. It will mean more fruits and veggies and less fat and salt. First major change, by the way, to school lunches in 30 years. And we're happy to report that a hostage incident has ended peacefully at a school in France. Earlier this morning, a teenager armed with two swords walked into a kindergarten class, held the teacher and five students hostage. He surrendered just a short time later. All right. Let's begin with the raging storm we just mentioned. First stop, Minneapolis and some video that's gone viral. Tony and I were just talking about this. Watch it. The inflatable roof at the Metrodome buckles under the weight of the heavy snow. First, the snow streams in, then a Teflon panel gives way and everything is caught on cameras because Fox TV was right there, Fox Sports, getting ready to shoot the game. Talk about picture-perfect position. And outside the familiar round tap top of the dome that's now sagging, crews are out bright and early scooping the snow off the roof and getting ready for repairs. Now, upstate New York, also the sites of this storm as it heads east, several inches have already fallen in Buffalo and the area will see even more through the next several days. Some parts of the state will get the full impact of the lake-effect with as much as a foot or two of snow possible. And a different story near Seattle, Washington, where there's too much rain, mudslides and flooding in the area has residents filling sandbags and watching the rivers rise. Several homes north of Seattle have flooded and mud slides have shut down passenger trains in that area, about 300 people staying in shelters now.

He says, ""As we do, when confronted by moments of darkness and challenge, we must now come together as one American family. These are rather -- it is a rather lengthy response that he has. And I will also tell you that the secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, saying that she's directed the Department of Homeland Security to provide any support necessary in the ongoing investigation. And we did learn, Fred, from the White House that President Obama -- we don't know if he was woken up, but it stands to reason that he was. He was alerted at 5:26 a.m. this morning by his top Homeland Security and counterterrorism advises that this had happened in Colorado, and he will be addressing this. He has two campaign events today. He'll be talking about this we've learned from White House officials at the first one, which is in Fort Myers, Florida, and we're expecting that around 11:20 a.m. and of course we'll bring that live. WHITFIELD: All right, Brianna Keilar. Thanks so much from the White House. Keep us posted on that. Again, the president's first remarks may be coming from Fort Myers, Florida, in the 11:00 a.m. hour. And of course we'll be bringing that to you. So a bit more now about the suspect involved in the shooting in the early hours there in Aurora, Colorado. What we know, a 24-year-old white male, we believe, according to officials, and this is clearly a well-planned attack. What would drive a young man to do something like this? And what could the motive possibly be? We'll be talking about that with a criminal profiler in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WHITFIELD: We're following breaking news from Aurora, Colorado. There has been a mass shooting inside a movie theater. Here is the latest that we know. Gunshots erupted in that theater during an early-morning screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" the new Batman movie. At least 12 people are dead, 38 more are wounded. At first, many people in the 16-screen theater thought that the gunfire was coming from a movie ongoing. Police have a suspect now in custody, a young man. He was heavily armed and was arrested in the theater's rear parking lot near his vehicle. So there were hundreds of people inside the movie theater complex when the shooting started early this morning. And many inside saw the gunman, including one woman who told affiliate KCNC the gunman pointed a weapon at her.

And that they want to make sure that their children's lives are preserved. They have a future without the fear of being gunned down unnecessarily. LEMON: I want to ask you about other duties as your role as a congresswoman, because Congressman Mark Meadows has been getting a lot of criticism for using Lynne -- he asked Lynne Patton, an official at HUD, to stand up at the Cohen hearing as an example that President Trump is not a racist. What was your reaction to that? MCBATH: It was somewhat disturbing to me, because I just really was disturbed that they were using, I believe, a woman of color to validate whether or not President Trump is a racist. And I just think it was disturbing to me. I believe if you have to bring someone forth and say this is proof that, you know, someone is not a racist. Why are you having to validate that? LEMON: Yeah. You know, after that incident happened, there's a video of -- that surfaced of Meadow in 2012 promising to send President Obama back to Kenya. He insisted today that he doesn't have a racial bone in his body. But does this -- and there's also another video of him saying the same thing. But does it highlight the disconnect over racial issues in this racial issues in this country you think? MCBATH: It most certainly does. We think that we've come so far. But I think the fact President Obama sat in office for eight years probably has been a precipice for a lot of the underlying racial tensions that we've had in this country that are now coming to fruition. LEMON: Listen. I think -- this is not a partisan issue any time you see diversity, right? There are not a lot of women who were in the roles of Senate at and Congress or whatever, you know, not as many as should be. And now, you know, you have this gun legislation. You have your other freshmen who are taking the lead on a lot of issues. The internet went wild with this photo. This -- put this up.

We are told he is remembered for his 30 years of service on the high court, remembered for his sense of humor, remembered for his wit and his skill with the pen. Whether you agreed with him ideologically or not, this is a giant on the court who has now passed. A short time ago, former President George W. Bush issued this statement. ""Laura and I mourn the death of a brilliant jurist and important American Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. He was a towering figure and important judge in our nation's highest court. He brought intellect, good judgment and wit to the bench. And he will be missed by his colleagues and our country. Laura and I send our heartfelt sympathies and condolences to his wife Maureen, their nine children and the entire Scalia family.""

Also CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, chief political analyst Gloria Borger. Look, we have to remember the man, the father, nine children, 28 grandchildren. Whether you agreed with him or not, a lot of people liked him as a man and loved the time they spent with him. Gloria Borger, to you though. On the politics of it, the President comes out, he speaks tonight before the GOP debate. Whoever the next president is will have an overwhelming amount of influence on who the next justice is. But the fact as David Gergen put it, you have all three branches of government now at play. Who's the next president, who leads in Congress and who's the next appointee to the Supreme Court? GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: And this president is going to name somebody to be the nominee, his nominee to the Supreme Court. And I think we can't overstate the seismic importance of that and the political fight that will ensue. And I think the President has a very interesting decision to make right now. And I think it's a question of does he -- you know, this is a president who's kind of been feeling his oats these days and has gone with executive actions on immigration and everything else. Does he go to the left and nominate somebody that the Republicans would clearly not support? Does he go for somebody more moderate so that he perhaps could get Republicans support there? And I think one thing we really haven't talked about and I'd like to ask you guys about is, the importance of the nominee, him or herself. You can't underestimate the sort of importance of the life story and the context that a nominee provides. Sonia Sotomayor, such a great life story.

Your frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I'm from the show me state -- you have to show me. The only thing that you all have shown so far is that you're about to impeach a duly elected President who has done nothing wrong. Democrats are not impeaching the President because they are scared of our republic or that he has committed a crime, they are impeaching him because they fear the President's policies and how well they are working for the American people. Most of all, they fear the election because they know they can't beat them. In fact, one of my Democrat colleagues is quoted stating ""I'm concerned if we don't impeach him, he will get re-elected."" This kind of rhetoric is disgusting. Impeachment is not a political weapon and any member who votes for impeachment should be ashamed today. You cannot undo the results of the 2016 election simply because your flawed candidate did not win. And thank God she didn't. Over the last three years, unemployment has dropped to the lowest point in generations. We are seeing better trade agreements with our trading partners and record numbers of taxes and regulations that stifle economic growth have been rolled back, all thanks to President Trump's leadership and commitment. But we shouldn't be surprised. Democrats have introduced articles of impeachment -- can I have one, 30 seconds? (UNKNOWN): We'll yield him 15 seconds. SPEAKER: Gentleman's recognized. ARMSTRONG: This is very important. We shouldn't be surprised. Democrats have introduced articles of impeachment in five out of our last six Republican presidents. They are the party of impeachment. The Democrats are the party of impeachment. SPEAKER: Gentleman yields back. And once again, members are admonished to address their remarks to the Chair. Gentleman from California? SCHIFF: Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is my pleasure to yield two minutes to the gentleman from California, Mr. Swalwell. SPEAKER: Mr. Swalwell's recognized for two minutes. SWALWELL: Donald Trump is using the presidency to put his own personal gain above our national interests. He is using our taxpayer dollars and foreign interference to cheat the next election and it jeopardizes our national security and integrity at the ballot box. And not a single fact in this case is seriously in dispute. I ask my colleagues, who sent his personal lawyer to Ukraine to investigate his political rival? Who fired an ambassador who stood in his way? Who conditioned a White House meeting on investigations that only personally benefited him and not the national interest? Who cut off military aid to an ally that desperately needed it? Who pressured President Zelensky to conduct those investigations?

(END VIDEO CLIP) HENRY: But of course there are media questions about why the president is revealing this previously secret program now, right before the midterm elections and right in the middle of a series of speeches on the seminal issue in those midterm election, the war on terror, where the president has been basically framing the Republican case. The president insisted today his move was not sparked by politics, but sparked instead by the Supreme Court's Hamdan decision in June, which basically held that military commissions could be used to prosecute these suspected terrorists, but only if there's a legislative framework from Congress in place. So the president immediately today sending legislation to the hill and putting the ball in Congress's court, demanding that they get this done in September, before going home for the year. The president finally is going to keep the pressure on tomorrow. Part four in this series of speeches on the war on terror in Atlanta. He is going to talk about gaps in security that led to 9/11, and talk about programs like the Patriot Act that he says he instituted and have helped thwart more terror attacks, Wolf. BLITZER: The president may deny that this has anything to do with politics, but it's clearly going back to that political playbook that worked so well for the Republicans in 2002-2004, by hammering away that they're saving lives, that the president is preventing another 9/11. Clearly there are political, serious political overtones in this decision to release all this previously classified information today. HENRY: Wolf, it's the elephant in the room. At the very outset of this series of speeches, the president insisted he didn't want it to be politicized. Let's face it this issue is front and center in the midterms, Wolf. BLITZER: Ed Henry at the White House, thank you. The president called on Congress to urgently pass the legislation dealing with the detainees. Let's get reaction from Capitol Hill on all of these developments. Our congressional correspondent Andrea Koppel is up on the hill and what are they saying up there Andrea? ANDREA KOPPEL, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well Wolf, as you know, military tribunals and putting terrorists on trial are just the kinds of issues that Republicans are looking to highlight just two months out from congressional midterms, so-called wedge issue. Republicans want to show themselves as being strong on national security, portraying the Democrats as being weak if they don't support this kind of legislation. Now, while Republican leaders quickly embrace the president's proposal, in fact, for one, the second most powerful Republican in this Senate, Mitch McConnell, saying that it strikes just the right balance, Republicans are by no means all on the same page.

And then there is that investigation and the upcoming funeral for Shannan and the girls. Joseph Scott Morgan, as a death investigator, he says that she strangled those babies. Can you tell forensically if you can get a look at those children`s necks, what the size of the hands were that may have done it? Is it provable that it was either he or she that did it? SCOTT MORGAN: I think that would be very difficult. What would be there, though, Ash, is the fact that underneath the layer of skin, there will be deep tissue hemorrhage in there, focal areas of hemorrhage. So it could be proven that these children and as well as Shannan, had been throttled at some point in time. BANFIELD: He was just so exquisite at lying. It`s hard to believe him now when he tells the story, but they have to forensically map this out in a case against him. There is, you know, a funeral planned for this Saturday. Alongside the same day that John McCain is being laid to rest, Shannan and the girls will be laid to rest. They are Catholic. It is often protocol to have an open casket. Do you see it as a possibility given the way that it is believed these -- this mother and two children died? That they could have open caskets? SCOTT MORGAN: I think that it might be difficult. I think that they`re going to be probably in a moderate state of decomposition. I think it would be very difficult, yes. BANFIELD: And not just necessarily because of the reported strangulation of them. It`s mostly that the state of decomposition after four days, correct? SCOTT MORGAN: I think any kind of external trauma on the neck could be covered, but unless their faces were marked up in some way traumatically. I think that decomposition will be the biggest hurdle to overcome. BANFIELD: That is just so incredibly sad. All of it. Every aspect of it.

Now, our Steve Helling with this bombshell reporting from People magazine that yes, indeed, the police are confirming to Steve Helling from People that he had both male and female lovers, that he was more than likely hiding from the woman who could not say more about him in the loving way that a wife would.

And it's just not a joking matter. There just are some things that we don't joke about. And throughout history, people have often invoked jokes is a way to cover up behavior that is otherwise not acceptable. People do it when they say something racist. When they do it -- when they say something sexist or misogynist or homophobic. And then they say, oh, I'm just joking. And you can't take a joke as if you're the problem. And the problem is, is joking about a very, very serious issue. COOPER: Yes. And McCarthy spokesperson told NBC News in response to his comments that he was obviously joking. It does sort of, you know, there's a lot of people who would listen to this discussion and say, well, look, this is political correctness gone amok. And, of course, he's just joking. And people laughed, and it was just a light hearted remark. POWERS: Well, I think people invoke political correctness when they try to discount serious issues. And so, it's a way to say, why can't we just make a joke about beating women? Because the same reason you don't make a joke about Jewish people, like just pick something that they actually care about I guess that they would, that they would understand. And so, it's, it's a way to ignore important issues, rather than just acknowledging that this isn't funny, that there are people that are watching this right now, there are people who heard that who are currently in abusive relationships and who have suffered violence, whether it's in a relationship or outside of a relationship of men, beating women. So I mean, it's a pretty violent act. I don't think that it's -- I don't think that is political correctness. I think it's honestly, I feel like not that long ago, even someone like Kevin McCarthy would was just say I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said it. And the fact that it got such a big laugh and that people can't just recognize that this is an OK. I think is highly problematic. COOPER: Do -- you don't expect Kevin McCarthy to apologize? Do you? POWERS: No. Because I think he is just all in on Trumpism and Trumpism now, it's about never saying you're sorry. And, you know, he won't say that he's sorry. But I also think that it's just an interesting joke to tell. It says, you know, he has this frustration with Nancy Pelosi and Nancy Pelosi is an incredibly powerful woman, she will go down in history books, as one of the most powerful speakers of the House, one of the most deft leaders of Congress.

And you know, in baseball, there was a congressional investigation to alleged steroid usage, and we`ve had actual deaths, and nothing`s happened. Now, getting back to the question, you know, there`s basically -- WWE, it doesn`t behoove them to take their biggest revenue makers, you know, out of the ring. They`re going to lose money, you know? So obviously, they turned -- you know, they turned a blind eye. VELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes. And of course, we have to say that we have made repeated calls to the WWE today seeking their side of the story. We haven`t gotten any comment from them today, but we reiterate we want to hear both sides and all sides of the story. So anybody from the WWE, we want to hear from you, and we`ll keep calling until we get your side of the story. Let`s go to Mike Brooks, who is here on set with me -- I`m delighted to have him -- CNN law enforcement analyst, former D.C. police officer, for some perspective. Because what I found very odd about all this, Mike, is that we`ve heard in this press release all this talk about Benoit getting all these steroids, but in the actual indictment, it`s two other individuals whose initials are not Benoit`s initials, and it`s not steroids, it`s a bunch of other drugs. MIKE BROOKS, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: No, it`s initials ""O.G."" and ""M.J."" But they said in one of the indictments that he had been doing -- all the drugs we`re hearing about, all the steroids, apparently, he had been (INAUDIBLE). They`re also looking at another pharmacy, the Signature pharmacy in Orlando, because apparently, he was getting mail order steroids from them also. And they have been in the news. It`s not the first time they`ve had some contact. But I think we`re just seeing a little bit, just a tip of this investigation, Jane. They did two search warrants on his office. They went in, they found out -- found some things they were looking for. Then they went back again because, in my opinion as an investigator, you don`t go back unless you feel like, OK, well, we took a look at this. Let`s go back and take a look at some additional -- because what they found apparently led to something else, and they wanted to go back and get some additional evidence. VELEZ-MITCHELL: So Mike, you`re saying it`s not like they didn`t find anything connecting them to Benoit, it`s just that they`re putting their case together and more will be revealed, as they say.

Wally Schirra is dead at the age of 84 after a battle with cancer. As one of the seven original Mercury astronauts, Schirra became the third American to orbit the Earth in 1962. And CNN's John Zarrella joins us now from Miami -- John. JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Don. You know, it's interesting that, you know, here we are when the United States space program is kind of struggling to find an identity, the shuttle program is winding down, perhaps we'll go on back to the moon and on to Mars, and Wally Schirra, one of the original seven, passes -- passes on today, and came from an era where there was direction. There was a moon race. There was a race to beat the Russians in space. It was part of the Cold War era. The space program had the direction back then. And as you mention, Wally Schirra flew in the Mercury program on Sigma 7. They chose the name Sigma 7, the Sigma, because he said he wanted to get rid of -- get away from the gee whiz names that had been used to something a little bit more technical. And the 7, of course, standing for the seven original astronauts, which, of course, he was one of. After his Mercury flight, which lasted nine hours and 15 minutes, Schirra went on to fly on Gemini 6. And on Gemini 6 they actually rendezvoused with another spacecraft, the Gemini 7 spacecraft which was already up in orbit. That was the first time that had ever happened. Then he went on as the commander of the Apollo 7 mission. Apollo 7 distinguished because it was the very first flight after the Apollo 1 fire that killed astronauts Grissom, Chaffee and White. And Apollo 7 was a redesigned spacecraft and came at a time when the United States was desperate for good news, a successful mission, and Apollo 7 certainly was that. Now, Wally Schirra, I always remember him from the times I talked to him as always funny, filled with a sense of humor. And he certainly exhibited that when he talked about how when they were first chosen they had no idea what they were getting into. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",0.5293242516580032,2007-05-03

But he also clearly took an ideological stance that everyone else in the party is taking on ISIS and leaving Rand Paul as sort of this isolated figure in the party, which helps differentiate Rand Paul but also I think is a dangerous place for him to be right now as we see in the polls that the country at large and the Republican party itself becoming a little bit more hawkish in light of all the ISIS news.

BURNETT: Gary Cohn used the words trickle down when he was talking about it recently. So, the plan cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. And your analysis, this is now the famous analysis which the president keeps citing, your study here, I'm just reading the lines. You say this cut could, conservatively, increase average household income by $4,000. I mean, conservatively $4,000 a year. Look, a lot of economists, Chairman, as you know, say this is extremely optimistic. Do you stand by that $4,000? HASSETT: Oh, absolutely. And if you look, we put out two CEA reports, that we've looked at a massive literature, more than a hundred sites. We've estimated the effect a number of different ways and absolutely I stand by that number. And it's important to remind the viewers where that comes from because what's happened is that, you know, the U.S., as you know, is the highest corporate tax place on earth, and the reason is -- BURNETT: Well -- HASSETT: -- in the developed world, and the reason is that everybody else has been cutting their rate, while we haven't been doing anything. And so, there's a massive amount of data where we've watched other countries reduce their corporate rates and then look to see what happens to workers. And there's a lot of literature that shows workers wages go up because companies decide to locate in a low tax country. And so, right now, we're a high tax country, our firms are locating factories offshore, increasing demand for workers offshore and driving down wages here and driving up wages over there. (CROSSTALK) BURNETT: But we're still going to be -- I mean, just on that pure reality, though, we are still going to be a high tax country. I mean, you know, you look at, Ireland raised taxes to 12-1/2 percent. Apple is, you know, supposedly putting all this money in Jersey, the Channel Islands, where they are getting zero percent. I mean, in a world that's what you are competing with, you are not going to win, even with this. HASSETT: Well, it's a terrific point, but you have to understand that there are a lot of good reasons to be in the United States, not just taxes. BURNETT: Right. HASSETT: And, you know, if we change the tax rates so that the U.S. is more attractive, then, you know, we have great universities, great workforce, hardworking people. You know, the infrastructure maybe even better next year after we see the president's infrastructure plan. You know, that kind of stuff will attract business back here.

One of the Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer, came out yesterday and said they are making a bunch of progress. You see Republicans in opinion polls moving to where a slight majority of Republicans now support some kind of immigration reform. You see the self-interest of members of Congress because you will recall from the last election by a three-to-one margin Republicans lost Hispanic voters, Mitt Romney lost Hispanic voters. So they understand it's in their self-interest to get something done. So you kind of see everything moving in that direction. WHITFIELD: And the potential stumbling blocks? BORGER: Of course. There are stumbling blocks. Look, it depends on what that pathway leads to. Does it lead to citizenship? Does it lead to some kind of legal status? And how can you ensure people that the border is secure first? You know, everybody -- Republicans I talk to go back to the days when Ronald Reagan passed immigration reform. And the problem with that everyone agrees was that the borders were not secure first. So Republicans are nervous that that could happen again. And they want to make sure that doesn't occur. There's also another stumbling block in the guest worker program. How do you provide for guest workers to come into this country? That's an issue for Democrats in particular. So there are stumbling blocks, or it would have been done years ago. But again political self-interest is at stake here. When that occurs, maybe they'll actually do it. WHITFIELD: All right.

CNN learns that Pentagon is now sending a Navy destroyer to pass within miles of China's controversial manmade islands.

A defense official confirms to CNN that a Navy destroyer will pass within 12 miles of controversial manmade islands in the South China Sea believed to have been built for China's military. We're told it could happen within hours and that China's military has not been officially informed. We're also following controversial remarks by the FBI director, James Comey, about the spike in violent crime across the United States. Comey says it may, repeat, may be the result of heightened scrutiny of police that's followed the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, last year and that officers may feel restrained. He also says the Black Lives Matter movements and countermovements that have sprung up in response may be pushing apart police and the communities they serve.

1541260,1856251,CNN,Erin Burnett Outfront,"course, obviously one of the most inflammatory things Donald Trump has said is that he would temporarily ban Muslims from coming to the United States. You do a lot of business in the Middle East. You do a lot of business in Saudi Arabia. You've done a lot of business with Saudi prince, Al-Waleed bin Talal, who when Donald Trump said that took to Twitter and said, ""RealDonalTrump, you are a disgrace, not only to the GOP but to all America. Withdraw from the U.S. presidential race as you will never win."" Tom, in addition to doing business in the Middle East, you are a Lebanese American. Do you have a problem with what Donald Trump has said about Muslims? How do you get your arms around that? BARRACK: So, let me give you both sides. First of all, Prince Al-Waleed is probably the greatest example of young Saudi generational leadership in the world. He's brilliant. He's astute. He's concise. He's a global investor and strangely enough, he has a lot of the same attributes in his part of the world that Donald has in ours. He's doing the right thing for what he needs to do in marking ground and Donald is doing the right thing in what he needs. He's drawing fences that he knows will be broken. So, when Donald is including 1.8 billion Muslims in one package, I assure you that Donald is not really thinking that that will be the case. I think what he's doing is sending a message in saying, look, Muslim community, you need to take responsibility and accountability for yourselves in all the things that happened or we're going to have a very serious conversation. I think they're both right.

KUBAYI-NGUBANE: But because of the economic impact on activities such as in tourism, and then we moved into -- we adopted a risk adjusted strategy, where we had about five -- we have five levels. Level five is hard lockdown. Level four, it's almost closer to lockdown restriction. And we are now at level three. So it's almost like moderate. And now we've seen community transmission. So it's not that we've locked down completely from level five to now. We've opened up. We've started to make some movements. We've allowed people to go to work, so that's why you're seeing some of the transmissions happening, so it is not out of control but we are managing it. QUEST: The fear is that this is going to get out of control. I mean, I know you're the Tourism Minister, but realistically, tourism will not take place this year in any meaningful sense and may not be -- maybe well into next year before that's able to happen. And the risk is that the situation in South Africa will get out of control? KUBAYI-NGUBANE: I don't think so. When we look at our projections, working as a government, together with our epidemiologists who are doing trends in terms of how we are performing, that's what I'm saying, if you look now, South Africa is in winter. And if you look at how the pandemic has conducted itself, or has performed in other regions, they've seen the surge during winter, as summer approached, they started to see stability. And that's what we expect in South Africa. We don't expect that you're not going to see tourism completely out of this year. We do have mainly -- we have tourism activities in winter, but our peak season starts in September until March. So that's what we are targeting to have. Our recovery strategies starts with domestic activities, then moves to regional and then into international from -- QUEST: OK, but realistically, you can't be -- I mean, are you seriously expecting large scale tourism, which to me even in September, particularly bearing in mind countries like France and Germany have still got you on the high risk list requiring testing. Minister, I just wonder how far and how real those expectations can be? KUBAYI-NGUBANE: Richard, that's what I'm saying domestic tourism. If you look at our potential as a country, in 2018, we had about 2.6 million in terms of movement of tourists domestically. In 2019, we were able to move into 7.1. So there is an opportunity for us to really drive domestic tourism, not only depending on international. We will move into international area where we are seeing -- that's what we are seeing.

The bomb caused a crater in front of the hotel and sent parts of the vehicle as far as 50 yards away. It also scattered the bodies of the suicide attackers, and police say they have found some body parts while looking for forensic evidence. Marty? SAVIDGE: Catherine, what's the word on arrests? Are there people in custody over this? BOND: We have talked to a number of Kenyan government officials here and Kenyan police and have not confirmed arrests. What they've said is that two people are being held in connection or on suspicion of having some information about these attacks. But they still characterize that rather differently than arresting two suspects who they know to be linked to the attacks. They tend to say that two people have been held for questioning, and that's a different thing in their eyes. Martin? SAVIDGE: Thank you very much for clarifying that. Catherine Bond outside of the Paradise Hotel, the scene of that terror attack against the Israelis and others today. As we said, the attack on the Israeli charter occurred seconds after takeoff. Now, this is a second attempt that was made on the aircraft besides the hotel bombing. And the plane flew on without further incident to its destination in Tel Aviv. There, the pilot described what had happened back in Kenya, to CNN's Matthew Chance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFFI MAREK, ARKIA FLIGH 582 PILOT: From Mombasa, we were retracting the landing gear.

But the -- but in this case, there's a big -- it probably doesn't show a lot of culturally sensitivity... QUEST: All right... HICKEY: -- to present it really well. QUEST: OK. Now, we're at the position now where these European leaders know each other extremely well. But when you get Cameron of Britain saying about Sarkozy, how would he feel about a tax on cheese and you get Sarkozy saying of Cameron, why don't you shut up, and -- rather than joining the euro, stop criticizing from the outside, do you think there's a point upon which protocol finally breaks down? HICKEY: I -- well, I would say that protocol defines their relationships. And, actually, when protocol works well, it creates an environment which is a stress-free environment where the people really get to communicate what they want to say really, really easily and correctly. So when someone is rude like that, it really doesn't build the relationships. And that's what we want our -- our leaders to do, is to have the relationships that are effective. So, yes, absolutely. If they are going to be rude to one another, it doesn't help anybody. It just makes them feel like they're powerful cowboys. QUEST: OK. Powerful cowboys, but the situation is so serious. Do you detect, Robert, in public life, a diminishing respect for protocol? You've been a student of it for -- for many years. You've obviously lived your life by the rules of protocol. Do you think we now think, ah, it's old fuddy-duddy stuff, say what you mean, mean what you say, get on with it? HICKEY: I think that -- that in the speed of communication now, leaders are held responsible for very quick turnaround. And so they don't have the slowness that they used to have a few years ago. I mean years ago, one leader would never even talk to another leader. It would go from -- it would go from his mouth to the diplomat or across the diplomat and up a chain. And today it's so fast that they really are probably much more unguarded with one another. And it doesn't really serve anybody's interests. So you're right. And, also, in -- in the case of our elected leaders, they're elected without any experience or any training to really be the seasoned diplomats that our country needs. QUEST: We thank you for that. That -- that was a diplomatic way, following protocol, of telling us what you think on that front. Many thanks, indeed, for joining us. Angela Merkel -- we await to see what the reply was.

166654,299708,CNN,American Morning,"BILL HEMMER, CNN ANCHOR: Let's get back to our top story again this morning, Saudi Arabia and the response that may or may not come now. U.S. authorities say the attacks appear to be the work of al Qaeda. They are extremely concerned that more may come. National security correspondent David Ensor back in D.C. with us. And many people are wondering, David, whether or not this signals a rebirth for al Qaeda and that network. Good morning there. DAVID ENSOR, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Bill. Well, it may be that al Qaeda never really died. So, this is not a rebirth, but a continuation. The officials I spoke to last night and this morning do say that there is a fair amount of intelligence out there suggesting that there may be additional attacks. They are not specific as to which country or place it might occur, but there is concern. That is why you saw that decision by the State Department to pull all nonessential personnel out of Saudi Arabia, and there may be other steps yet to come. Now, Saudi officials are reportedly saying this morning that they believe that these attacks were organized by an Afghan war veteran named Khalid Muhammad Mussalim al-Juhani (ph), and this is an individual that the U.S. was aware of. He is, in fact, someone who was on one of the videotapes that was captured in Afghanistan during the war there. Officials here, at least as of late last night, had not been able to confirm that he was involved in these particular attacks, but they'll obviously be looking at closely at that individual and others he may have known. Some of the -- here he is, al-Juhani (ph), the individual that I spoke of. You may remember the videotape of him kissing a Kalashnikov that was shown on our air many months ago, towards the end of the Afghan war. So, that will be a lead that will be followed clearly by U.S. and Saudi investigators, as they try to get to the bottom of these attacks. As you mentioned, U.S. officials are hopeful and so far believe that cooperation has been very good between the two countries. There are, of course, others who will also be interested. There are British and other dead, so other countries will also wish to be involved in the investigation, which is going to be complex. But, again, the first lead suggests it is, indeed, al Qaeda -- Bill. HEMMER: David Ensor in Washington, we'll talk later today.

1940229,2256651,CNN,Don Lemon Tonight,"you this, Congressman Dent, since we are on this vein. There is -- you cannot compare the how much, right, one does it or the other one does it. I mean, President Trump does it almost every single day. And, you know, I think that he's right here, that Keith is right every once in a while, and it's not to say it is right, it is certainly wrong and deserve to be called out. Someone will say something that is a bit untoward the people are uncomfortable with and everyone jumps on it. But every day, every day, on auto play, the president says something awful about the media, about a political opponent, about someone. And now seems to want it both ways. We've got to stop doing this, but he continues to do it. He said that last night. We go to stop doing this. And then this morning, we wake up to a negative tweet about the media. DENT: Don, you're right. All of use from time to time may use a metaphor we regret or may use an analogy that is a little bit over the top. When you're president of the United States, you have a special responsibility and duty, I believe, to be measured. Because the words of the president are seen as policy. And unfortunately with President trump, he has often said things that his staff has contradicted, that people had to walk back on his behalf, that the president must show greater restraint. It's that simple. He has to turn the temperature down. Tone it down. He has got a responsibility. I guess what I'm trying to say is he's got to be better. He is supposed to be better than the rest of us when it comes to use of language, I think. That's always been my view. But again, his words matter. They're supposed to matter. We've been told time and again by so many people who at times apologized for this president that, you know, you don't have to take his words literally. Well, most people do. LEMON: Yeah. That's how most people -- that's what most people do, is take words literally. OK, listen, we have a lot to discuss, so don't go anywhere. What the former vice president, Joe Biden, said on the campaign trail just today.

But until there are as many jobs as we need we also are going to need to extend those unemployment insurance benefits. COSTELLO: OK. You just mentioned three things that we know won't go anywhere any time soon. Nobody is even talking about it much. FURMAN: You know Carol, I just -- the President is out there doing everything he can to push those forward. Let's take investments in America's infrastructure, in our roads and bridges. The program that does that expires at the end of September. That is a bipartisan program. It has had strong support from Democrats and Republicans in the past. I certainly hope that both sides would use the next eight months to -- eight, nine months to come together on an agreement to invest more in our roads and bridges and put people back to work. COSTELLO: But here's the thing. You use the word ""hope"" but it is up to the President of the United States to inspire confidence in our economy and that will get people out there spending more money but that's not happening. What is the president not doing? Because a lot of people -- only 24 percent of people feel the economy is getting any better. FURMAN: You know -- the president is out there. In his last press conference before he left on break, he went and talked about how we were ending the year in a stronger place than we began it. You see that in a range of statistics, whether it is the GDP statistics, the manufacturing number, consumer confidence which is recovering from where it was in October. So you do have an economy that is healing. You do have an economy that is continuing to strengthen. COSTELLO: Why don't more people feel that? (CROSSTALK) FURMAN: The president is being -- well, the president is being optimistic but at 6.7 percent, the unemployment rate is still well above where it should be. It is particularly above where it should be for the long-term unemployed. So you know, we have made progress but we have a lot more work to do. It sounds trite but that doesn't make it any less true. COSTELLO: Well, the other reason people are feeling bad about the economy is because they are not making much money. Wages for the middle class have stagnated for the past 30 (ph) or four (ph) years. And they are not going to go up now. Should we just get used to this? FURMAN: Absolutely not. We need to be doing everything we can to turn around. You just said wages -- one thing we could do to turn around the numbers on wages is to raise the minimum wage. That actually hasn't gone up in inflation-adjusted terms in 64 years. 64 years, the minimum wage hasn't been increased to adjust for inflation. We",0.1217961955898212,2014-01-10

And 19 employees are suing the company saying, not only did they suffer racial discrimination at an Ohio facility, but also the supervisor enabled and encouraged the racist behavior, from frequent use of the ""N"" word to a noose hung above the workstation of a black employee. CNN's Sara Sidner has this story. And I have to warn you, it contains language some will find offensive. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANTONIO LINO, UPS EMPLOYEE: It's been there. PAMELA CAMPER: UPS EMPLOYEE: And nothing happens. LINO: But it's a job and I got responsibilities. SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Pamela Camper and Antonio Lino have worked for UPS in Ohio for almost their entire adult lives, 30 and 25 years respectively. They say all they want is fair treatment at the distribution center. What they often get is it hatred. LINO: I happened to look over my shoulder and there was a noose hanging over my workstation. First thing Monday morning. To a black man in America, a noose is death. SIDNER: He said it took a year for UPS to terminate the person who hung it. Camper has had her own racist run-ins as a part-time supervisor. CAMPER: We have a driver, female, white driver, who decided she didn't want to deliver a package because she stated it was a Nigger city and Niggerville area. SIDNER: the lawsuit also revealed that a rude text message where white employees are texting about winning the lottery. One person remarked, ""If they lost and were feeling down, the noose is loose."" Another replied, ""We can buy another noose with the winnings."" Camper says it goes beyond threatening words, though, it's about inaction. After three decades at UPS, she is still only part time. CAMPER: I cry every night because nothing has changed. SIDNER: Lino says he and his black co-workers are often given the backbreaking work of loading and unloading the heaviest packages, not the better-paying driving jobs that their white counterparts get.

609716,859684,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"that's right. But the other point here is that Hispanics are really paying attention to this election. And even though they might think that Senator McCain is a likable guy, they also are understanding that electing him means embracing four more years of the disastrous economic and foreign policies that have put us in this hole to begin with, and that have put them in a very precarious situation from an economic standpoint. They want a change, and again, Senator Obama represents that change on all of the issues that are important to Hispanics. SANCHEZ: Sorry. The biggest problem Senator Barack Obama has is he's still talking, (INAUDIBLE). He looks at Hispanics through a lens that we're all on one, you know, class section and he doesn't understand how diverse and dynamic the community is. Even when you talk about Evangelical voters, business owners, young blood, even the elections and the campaign we run in 2008 is completely different from 2004. So to look and say, hey, everybody is a default to a Democrat, they don't understand the economic impact in terms of taxes, the business impact he's going to have, and national security is to ignore the fact that Hispanic voter is not monolithic and is really diverse. COLLINS: Yes. And the issue on top of that -- is it not -- is really from, at least from what I'm reading on this poll -- is education is what Hispanics, again, at least in this poll, are actually... CARDONA: Absolutely, Heidi. COLLINS: ... really concerned about. CARDONA: Absolutely. And I think that the problem from John McCain is also there's a saying in the Hispanic community, (speaking in Spanish), which loosely translated means tell me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are. They see that John McCain has deeply embraced George Bush. And on all these issues -- and you named it, Heidi -- education is number one. Public schools are incredibly important to Latinos. Senator Obama wants to fully fund public schools, wants to bring in more teachers, and John McCain is not giving Hispanics the alternatives that they want. SANCHEZ: You know and the reality is John McCain believes in support -- in ending failing schools and supporting children and allowing every child to get a college education. He doesn't believe you should set an expectation based on race, color, you know, economic class. And I think that's the difference in the policies. Barack Obama doesn't want to look at school choice, it's helped a lot of Latino and African-American families. It's a very serious debate and education is right on the forefront. COLLINS: Ladies I have to... CARDONA: School choice... COLLINS: That was pretty equal. (CROSSTALK) CARDONA: Sorry. COLLINS: That was pretty equal. Let's leave it there. CARDONA: Thanks, Heidi.

124077,184649,CNN,CNN Moneyline Weekend,"but the Arthur Andersen connection is going to make everybody go and scrub the numbers again. And you figure if there's -- I think the numbers are going to get very honest very quickly, because I can't imagine an auditor proving anything right now that might reflect back in an Arthur Andersen type of way. But right after Enron came, a couple other bankruptcies and Global Crossings and then some accounting questions about some pretty good companies -- whether they are founded or not, there's still some questions. So we're getting through this. I don't think this is going to last all that much longer, but right now it's ugly. SCHAFFLER: Fred, we've got this situation where nobody has confidence. How do you get through it? Time? FRED PRICE, SANDLER O'NEILL: Time, yeah, and just expect the volatility, and find within that volatility opportunities to play. You know, sometimes there will be a nice bottom to buy some of these good companies that have probably been tarred unfairly with this kind of general view that there must be some real issues out there in every balance sheet. SCHAFFLER: John, you would think eventually it's going to be good news if we all get straight numbers, and as soon as possible? JOHN RYDING, BEAR STEARNS: Well, it is good news. And the other thing is that focusing on accounting issues, we've forgotten about the macro picture. And while the eyes have been turned away from that, the economy is creeping closer to recovery, if we haven't already come to the end of the recession. So when people have a little more trust of the numbers and then come back and focus on the macro, having beaten these stocks down a bit, I think that there could be a fairly good short-term rally going into the second quarter, as the eye comes back onto the economic outlook. SCHAFFLER: What about that sentiment number Friday? A bit surprising there. RYDING: We were looking for a decline, because expectations in the Michigan survey has been very closely tied to equity prices. And as equity prices come down, with the problems over accounting and disclosure, that has undermined the expectations number. The confidence number, however, within that -- if you look at the current situation, improved, and a number of surveys have shown improving consumers estimates of their own current position, even as they are a little concerned about some of these issues. So I am encouraged that's another recovery sign. SCHAFFLER: Encouraging on the economic front? FARRELL: Absolutely. Yeah. I think John says it right. The economy is recovering. Whether that means higher stock prices or not is to be debated about what level of earnings we'll get to. But the consumer's is relatively confident. We saw that with car sales starting last fall.

Overseas, the administration watching a building storm over Iran's disputed election when the protesters now saying was stolen away from them. Here to offer his take, CNN contributor Bill Bennett joining us this morning from North Carolina. Sir, good to have you as always. Tell us first on Iran what should he be doing right now? What can the president really do given the situation being what it is in Iran. BILL BENNETT, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's time to shift gears a little bit, T.J., and to let people know that he's on the side of the people and not the side of this government. The evidence is mounting that this election was stolen. Independent reporters from various provinces suggest that Mousavi had more votes than Ahmadinejad. So there's that problem. You know, Obama was supposed to be pushing the reset button and we were supposed to be having a whole new relationship with Iran. Doesn't look that way. Support communications efforts of people who are trying to get strikes and reform against this government, broadcast that you were in favor of the people.

At the scene in West Allis, Wisconsin, the ""Tribune"" is reporting that investigators found, get this, 300 .22 caliber shell casings in the vehicle. Twenty-two caliber shell casings are the same caliber that were found in Judge Lefkow's home. It was last Monday that Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow, a federal judge here in Chicago, came home to find two main people in her life shot to death in the basement of the home. Her husband, attorney Michael Lefkow and her 89-year-old mother Donna Humphrey. There was media speculation when this story broke that there could have been some connection to white supremacy groups. Because last year white supremacist Matt Hale was convicted of plotting to kill Judge Lefkow. But now with these latest developments in the case, there is certainly a possibility that the reasons behind these murders may have nothing to do with white supremacy groups at all. And I should note that Matt Hale has denied any involvement with these murders. Back to you, Daryn. KAGAN: And I think he faces sentencing in a case on April 6. So much focus, as you were saying, Keith, on Matthew Hale, on the white supremacist. Was there any interest in Bart Ross before this? Was he even a person of interest? OPPENHEIM: He was, but I have to put that in context. Because our sources are saying that he was being looked at, but there were many cases that Judge Lefkow had that were being look looked at. He was on a list. So there was not intense interest in this guy, but he was one of several that they were looking at. And just keep in mind that federal judges sometimes deal in dangerous territory, making decisions for and against people. We've talk to federal judges since this story broke. And they've said that's the lay of the land for them, so that there is always a certain risk. But I don't think that we can say that prior to this point that investigators looked at Bart Ross as someone who held high risk. He was just on a general list of people to be looked at. KAGAN: Keith Oppenheim live from Chicago for us. Thank you. Another story for you now. We're expecting more details this morning on the capture of a fugitive on the FBI's Most Wanted List.

But when he asked me to come back and campaign for him when he ran for the House in 1982, he won that time and he won in '86. And we'd go on to serve in Congress together for more than 30 years. We worked together with Barack during the eight years we were in office and even when Harry was done in the Senate, he was never really done, as all of you from Nevada know. He'd ask me to campaign for an awful lot of Nevada Democrats. Many of them are here today. I could never say no, although probably said, oh, God, he invited Biden into my district? But I talked to him often during this last election, taking his advice, and Landra can tell you, coming to his home on more than one occasion to visit and get his advice and where I should be going in order to win. After we won, one of the things that Harry did, which was sort of incongruous with Harry, as we've heard today, he sent me a text. I've saved it. He said, ""I'm so proud. Joe, you're my brother. We won."" Well, it made a big deal to me, it was a big deal to me that he felt that way. I know Harry never wrote what he didn't believe. It made me feel good. And he gave me a sense of confidence. It felt like he was my brother. I counted on him. And I know so many of you felt that same way about Harry as well throughout his career and your great relationship with him. Over five decades, we became genuine friends. The Irish Catholic kid from Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the Latter-Day Saints from Searchlight. You think I'm kidding? But Harry was like the guys I grew up with back in Scranton and in Claymont, Delaware. Harry would always have your back like the guys I grew up with. Harry had mine, and he knew I had his. Although, I sometimes wondered, when I was trying to make an important point to Harry, about whether he really did have my back as he hung up. But to tell you the truth, every time, every time he would do it, I knew it was the real Harry. It was him. He had all he needed. He didn't want any more or need any more. And we did share some similarities. Barack said we have loving families, wives that are smarter and better looking than we were. And Harry and I both liked to talk a lot. I'm just testing whether you're asleep yet. (LAUGHTER) BIDEN: But whether you served with Harry for decades or you were new to America just a few days ago, you wanted Harry in your corner.

(END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: You know, those hecklers want President Obama to support same- sex marriage, but officially he is still opposed. He says, however, that his views are, quote, ""evolving."" So what is New York's new law mean for the rest of the nation and next year's election? Let's talk about it now with CNN contributor Errol Louis, political anchor for New York 1 as well. Errol, OK, what was the force behind this change that pushed us over the top? There is an interesting dynamic going on here. ERROL LOUIS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the vote in New York was really a very old political story. The side that wanted same-sex marriage was organized. They had a lot of money. They had some solidarity. They had a smart strategy. And the other side didn't have any of those things. They were kind of dithering. They were a little bit scared, frankly, by the amount of passion and energy and organization they were confronting, and in the end, they didn't have what it took to fight it off. LEMON: OK. And Republicans actually helped. There were some Republicans helping to raise money in support of this bill? LOUIS: Absolutely. There are groups like GOProud that have been doing a national effort. They've got a ton of money. They've got some big names, Ken Mehlman and some others who are serious organization Republicans, who have been making ads, making threats, going into states and telling people, ""Look, you get with the program or you are going to have a primary next time around."" It really had an effect. LEMON: All right. Very interesting. And we heard President Obama coming out of the break there. He won't say whether he supports same- sex marriage, but he likes to say that he is evolving. Is it -- I don't know, is he trying to have it both ways? That's the question. LOUIS: Well, yes, to a certain extent. You can see from his points of view that it kind of makes sense for him to try and have it both ways. I mean, he's the one who rid of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" He's the one who says that the federal government will no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act. He's the one who has pushed for a hate- crimes legislation. He's done quite a lot. So he deserves some credit. On the other hand, he doesn't want to take this last step for same-sex marriage. He's trying to make the case that he should not be penalized at the polls or by donors who want him to go further in the direction that he is already taking a few steps in.

And that's a true story and all I did was like send Charlie and Margaret in there and then just let my imagination go wild based on all the characters that were just sitting right there to have fun with. SMERCONISH: So you've now had enormous success with fiction and non- fiction. I'm thinking of course of ""The Outpost,"" the great Rod Lurie, by the way. Good match for you in bringing that to the screen. Which is more fun? TAPPER: Without question fiction is more fun. Non-fiction, the story of ""The Outpost,"" this Afghanistan outpost and the U.S. soldiers, the true story, that's more meaningful. That was, you know, to this day the most meaningful professional experience of my life, telling those stories and bringing their voices to the book and then to the screen because it was an -- it was a tale that nobody knew at the time. Now people know it better because of the book and even more so because of Rod Lurie and his amazing work in the movie and I hope people get a chance to see it.

Officials were thinking we should be seeing more people on roads exiting the city. They were not seeing those numbers and that's why they're a bit worried, Don, because at this point, officials are saying, you got to hunker down at home. You got to stay where you're at right now. Stay put. Because it is not going to be safe. They don't know exactly when the winds are going to start picking up here, but they do know that in the next 24 hours, that's probably going to happen. And Jacksonville is a city of bridges. That's how it is connected. Once sustained winds go up to 40, to 45 miles an hour, those bridges are closed. There's no going in or out. Not even first responders are able to move in those areas until the conditions are safe enough for them to maneuver. And, of course, what's next once the hurricane hits? Search and rescues. That's what we are expecting and that's what first responders are telling us. Don? LEMON: Rosa Flores in a facility where people are hunkering down and staying safe. Rosa Flores, I appreciate that. I want to bring in now Juliette Kayyem and also Alan Levine to talk about what's happening here. To talk about security and to talk about safety. Alan Levine is a former secretary of health of both Florida and Louisiana, and the disaster of management, response and recovery expert. And also Juliette Kayyem who is a CNN national security analyst. Also, by the way, the author of ""Security Mom."" So my question, let's start with you first, Juliette. A lot of talk over the past few days from state and local leaders stressing the dangers to people. Are they learning from past mistakes for this particular situation? JULIETTE KAYYEM, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Oh, absolutely. Look, every disaster is horrible in its own right and the silver lining or the blessing is that we do better next time. So you're starting to see some of the lessons of previous hurricanes sort of taken to protect lives in this one. In particular, the sort of movement forward, the surging of assets that you see from the federal government, not waiting for the storm to hit but having pre- positioned assets in place so that when the storm passes by, you already have relief efforts there. You also saw what was may, they have been viewed by some as too early evacuation order. It was not. The problem after Hurricane Katrina or when people looked at it, they realized that the evacuation orders had come ""too late and they were too voluntary."" I'm going to put that in quotes. In other words, the reason why you're hearing political officials be so angry, be so direct and be so scary, be so tough love, so to speak, is because fear gets people to move.

How quickly after you become - TRUMP: Very quickly. I mean it's - it's a process, but fairly quickly. I mean the fact is, I would like to see it moved and I would like to see it in Jerusalem. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: Apparently he's not going to - his first - he's not going to do it now. He's got a deadline. Every six months for 20 years an American president has to sign a waiver saying for national security interests, concerns, the U.S. embassy will stay in Tel Aviv. KIRBY: That's right. So governing is now coming - clashing up against campaigning and he's realizing what presidents before him have realized, that it's better for our interests to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv where it belongs. I mean we - we've talked about this many, many times, moving it to Jerusalem, while it sounds great, could actually do a lot of damage to the peace process and, quite frankly, it could put American tourists and American civil servants that are working in Jerusalem, I'm sorry, in Israel, at risk. So it's not a smart thing to do. And back on that, if I could just back on climate change, I mean what we do by pulling out of this is seed leadership to China specifically. President Xi came out just the last couple of days saying, he's committed, he's going to stay at it. And if we seed leadership on climate changing to China, then the standards won't be as transparent. We won't have a voice in making sure that accountability is held for all the members of it. BLITZER: Very quickly, Fred, is there a consistent reaction over there in Europe to how the president did during his meetings over the pasts several days? PLEITGEN: Well, you know what, there is a bit of division here among the European countries. You have countries like Hungary, who felt that the president did quite well. But if you look at most of the larger continental European countries, you take Germany, you take France, you take Italy, I think that they came away a bit alienated with this new administration saying they don't really know where they stand with the White House at this point in time. And you have leaders like Angela Merkel saying, look, we're just not sure what this White House is going to be about in the next couple of years. And I think one of the things that you're going to see is what John Kirby was just talking about. You're going to see a lot of these European countries, first of all, work closely together with one another.

And everybody looks at that with respect and you know, looks up to it. This chaotic and now we do it, now we don't kind of attitude toward briefings, toward telling people things. I think is damaging this White House. It is obviously causing problems inside, but I think it's also eroding the trust and the president's capacity to build any support beyond his base. I find it astonishing that they have gotten into this. So, you know, when Jim Acosta walked out saying we are being stone walled, these briefings are useless, we have hit a new low. I think it's really bad for democracy. Press briefings are a way to hold people accountable for their actions. And frankly, I think regular press briefings force the White House, force the whole administration to up the quality of their game because they are online every day. Every day, they are held accountable. And I think it makes things better in the White House and they govern more effectively.

It's an act of desperation. It's not something -- it's not a strategy. The fundamental problem isn't that they are having press briefings. It's that the press secretary doesn't know what's happening, cannot communicate, cannot -- probably doesn't talk regularly to the president. The president is freelancing, changing things on the fly. And how do you fix that? Well, look, I don't think that Donald Trump could bring in a Mike McCurry, right? I don't think that someone of that stature is number one, going at this point to come to the White House. Number two, I don't think Donald Trump would listen to him. Who might Donald Trump actually listen to? Someone like a Laura Ingraham. I think if you know -- any other circumstance, this would be a crazy idea.

They're appalled and sort of saddened by the fact that the Trump plan for non- proliferation is actually proliferation of nuclear weapons. It doesn't make any real sense at all.

So, I don't think it's fair to say all he wants to do is preserve the Bush tax cuts. BLITZER: He also says that Senator Obama has not presented a plan of his own. I'm going to play this little clip. Listen to what he said today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MCCAIN: Senator Obama has declined to put forth a plan of his own. In a time of crisis, when leadership is needed, Senator Obama has simply not provided it. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: All right, quickly, if you want to respond to that. GOOLSBEE: Well, it's getting pretty cheeky. In the words of my father, just because you said it doesn't make it so. Senator Obama has been saying for more than a year clear ideas, that we need to reestablish oversight in the market system, just this week laid out a detailed six-point plan. The specific plan that McCain put forward literally looks like something that came out of a Cracker Jacks box. I mean, it's 10 lines long. It wasn't a specific plan. Senator Obama has been working with Secretary Paulson, Chairman Bernanke, leaders in the House and Senate, experts like Paul Volcker and Warren Buffett, trying to get out of the political. This is not a political event. We have a real crisis facing this country and facing the retirement savings of millions of people. And we have got to the address this quickly. And we have got to do it in a way that isn't a blank check and that addresses the root issues facing hardworking Americans. Their problems are how we got into this mess. And so that's what we have got to do. BLITZER: Austan Goolsbee is the senior economic adviser to Senator Obama. Austan, thanks for coming in. GOOLSBEE: Great to see you again, Wolf.

It looks like a Ford Explorer sports truck or maybe a Nissan (INAUDIBLE), something along those lines. GRACE: Do you believe the FBI could help you identify or isolate the type of truck? LOCKHART: We have sent the tape to them to try and enhance the image, but the system itself is an older system and it`s not a VHS tape so we`re not sure what we`ll be able to get back from.

LUMTIN: We had to rip this door out. As soon as I got out, Richard was gone. He was out. We could hear him outside, saying to us, ""I'm over here! Pull the raft this way."" Sure enough, he pulled it over and brought it upright again. NARRATOR: Stanley and Gibson's raft was still drifting upside down. Oxygen was running out fast. The stranded men had to act. STANLEY: We all agreed that there was no guarantee that someone going in in the pitch black trying to right this raft would not be knocked off and lost. So we hesitated. Then it got down to the obvious thing to do, is to cut a hole, and let some air in. GIBSON: There was no other way out. And I guess as a bride and a groom cut a cake together, so the five of us had to put our heads on the knife. We stayed like that for some time, until another monster came through and this time it landed (UNINTELLIGIBLE). NARRATOR: Suddenly, the hole that had been their salvation became their peril. Under their weight, the opening began to grow. STANLEY: The split just got bigger and bigger, and it went right across the bottom of the raft. GIBSON: (UNINTELLIGIBLE). The split becoming bigger.

And then I was falling. And I was falling, and I was tumbling, and I was moving. And I was roaring down the face of a monster wave. STANLEY: Eventually, it stopped, and I came up to grab some air, and I grabbed air, and I yelled out, ""is everybody there?""

RIPLEY: Back in late 2017, North Korea began a self imposed moratorium on long range missile testing and nuclear testing. This was done in conjunction with the Korean detente, that diplomacy between Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, and former U.S. president Trump. Even though there were some smaller launches, last time we saw a series of launches, a missile launching binge, if you will, it was back in 2019. But the relationship, the personal relationship, the letters exchanged with president Trump, calmed down Kim Jong-un, at least on the surface. We have no idea -- and a lot of analysts think that quietly he's actually been growing his arsenal this whole time, even during that period of diplomacy with the former president, which now brings us back to this point. The Biden administration, they have reached out to North Korea but the North Koreans do not feel that those offers are legitimate. They think the United States is disingenuous, they don't trust the U.S. and they have vowed to bolster their defenses against the U.S. And it's signaled that the next step could be long range, meaning intercontinental ballistic missiles or possibly even nuclear testing, Michael.

The latest coronavirus developments, from around the world, coming up. (MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING) HOLMES: Despite Austria joining the list of European nations easing COVID-19 restrictions, protesters took to the streets once again. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HOLMES (voice-over): With drums beating, thousands of people once again marched through Vienna, to protest the country's strict COVID 19 restrictions and vaccine mandates. But at a news conference Saturday, Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer announced that some of those coronavirus measures will begin to ease up soon, especially those targeting the unvaccinated. He said that, as of February 12th, people who are not vaccinated will no longer be barred from nonessential shops. The following week, he said, they will be able to go to restaurants and other tourist attractions if they have proof of recovery or a negative coronavirus test. Last week, the government said it was lifting the lockdown restrictions on the unvaccinated on Monday. Since November, they have only been able to leave their homes for essential reasons, like work or buying food. Officials say that, even though infections remain high, the number of people hospitalized has dropped, which has allowed them to relax some of the rules. One thing that is not changing is the country's vaccine mandate for all Austrians over 18, except those with a medical waiver or proof of recent recovery. That still takes effect Tuesday.

In one video, you can see one of the gunmen picking up a shoe on the street near the car that he sped away in. And that shoe may have been part of his disguise, a new disguise that he was going to take on after he got rid of his black outfit and mask. So it could be - it could very well be the case that these three will be able to slip unnoticed away from those people who would like to find them, meaning just about all the police in France at this point, Ashleigh. BANFIELD: Well, we're certainly going to get to the forensic trail they just may well have left behind and how that could be helping law enforcement as you and I speak live to track them. But before I do that, let's talk about the people they targeted. The word now that the editor of that magazine is dead. The top cartoonists are dead. Tell me about these victims and the actually targeting of them. BITTERMANN: Well, the thing is that the assailants obviously had some advance information about when the magazine was going to have its editorial meeting because it's not every day and it's not every hour that these -- that the people that were killed today, the ten journalists, would be around the magazine at all. Some of them work for different magazines. Some of them work from home. But there was this editorial meeting going on this morning at 11:30 when the gunmen broke in and targeted these journalists. Now, the magazine makes its money, makes its hay off the idea that it's going to be more extreme, more radical, more daring than anybody else. And they've been doing that for a good decade now. In any case, they have had controversies around them in the past. In 2011, they presented something called Sharia Hebdo (ph), which was a real send-up of the Islamic terrorism operations at the time and a send-up of the Prophet Muhammad. And as a consequence, they were fire-bombed at that point. So they knew that they were controversial. They liked being controversial. But they also knew they were in danger. The head editor and also the cartoonists had some protection by police. The editor had, in fact, a policeman with him and we believe that he is one of the victims, one of the police victims that has been talked about. So they knew they were under threat, but that didn't stop the assailants today who came at this with an almost military-style operation, Ashleigh. BANFIELD: And we're going to talk a little bit more, Jim, in a moment about that editor and some of his rationale for the kinds of publications they put out.

Unfortunately Mr. Walker was not treated in a manner our veterans deserve.

There is -- you've shown instances of racism and all kinds of hatred, all across the country and this is indicative of a much larger problem that we're facing here. And -- LEMON: Do you think it's a direct result of the election? COLE: I think it's a direct result of the people who were motivated and emboldened by this entire campaign. This campaign was run on hate and bigotry. And it inspired a lot of people to hate. LEMON: Mr. Walker, your service dog has an interesting name. Tell us about that. WALKER: Well, actually, I'm glad you brought that up. He didn't like my dog's name. I told him my dog name's was Barack and, you know, he really didn't like that at all. LEMON: The Trump supporter or the manager? WALKER: The Trump supporter. You know, he's the gentleman that came by and rubbed my dog and he asked the name of it, and I said Barack, and you know, at that point, he didn't seem too happy about that. LEMON: As a member of the military, Donald Trump is -- will soon be your commander-in-chief. What do you say to him? WALKER: Well, I'm not a member of the military anymore, but we need to stop the hatred and he needs to retract a lot of the things that he said and try to bring down the temperature of this country before we are looking like some third-world country.

An Israeli delegation is going to Washington tomorrow to meet with the American team in the P5+1 negotiations. What is their message? And what is your message? BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL: Don't do a bad deal, do a good deal. The good deal is what was done with Syria. In the case of Syria, the United States lead an effort to dismantle and remove Syria's chemical stockpiles and its means to make chemical weapons. What Iran is pushing for is an entirely different deal, that is to keep and inspect. Keep its nuclear stockpiles and the means to make nuclear weapons and rely on inspectors to prevent it from using them. WEDEMAN: Are you worried that given the situation in Iraq, the United States is eager to get Iran on board and therefore this whole nuclear issue is going to be diluted for the sake of some sort of arrangement in Iraq? NETANYAHU: Well, I hope not because that would be a grievous strategic error. That is you cross a historical threshold of giving the Ayatollahs atomic bombs for tactic daily gains in Iraq? I just don't believe it. WEDEMAN: ...giving the ayatollahs atomic bombs. NETANYAHU: But that's essentially what will happen if they have the capability to make atomic bombs, or the enriched material necessary for atomic bombs in a very short order. That's what is being discussed. WEDEMAN: People accuse you of crying Wolf, that this is just another case of crying wolf. NETANYAHU: No, I think we've been able to stop the hemorrhaging. I mean, it's taken Iran a lot longer to get where it is because of the warnings and actions that were put in place by many people, including myself, including the sanctions, really, that held it back. But now the question is do you allow them to go the last mile? If you do, then the world will change. We have Sunnis, militant Sunnis and militant Shiites, lead by Iran, fighting each other. You don't want either side of them to have weapons of mass death, huge mistake. Don't do it. WEDEMAN: But what we do see is a gradual rapprochement between the United States and Iran. They're talking about, they're negotiating. They're making sanction -- the sanctions regime is being modified. Are you worried that these United States is making a fundamental shift in its Mideast policy closer to Iran? NETANYAHU: Well, I hope not. And it would be unwise to do that, because Iran is not your friend. It is your enemy. It is our enemy, your enemy -- just as the militant Shiite are your enemies. The fact that both enemies are fighting one another, doesn't make one of them your friend. It's not the case. In the Middle East , the enemy of my enemy is still my enemy.

It's very difficult to be shocked or surprised by any of this, Richard. But it is an absolute fiasco for sure. QUEST: Right. Don Riddell, thank you very much. Our FIFA fiasco correspondent, Don Riddell, bringing us up there. Swiss watchmaker Hublot is a major FIFA sponsor. Now, Hublot was the official timekeeper of the 2014 World Cup. As you can see. And it will reprise that role in 2018. While many sponsors have either cut ties with FIFA or called for Blatter to step down, Hublot has done neither. So now, we're going to give the head of Hublot, the chief exec, Jean- Claude Biver, the chance to actually say in clear terms, sir, what do you think about the current fiasco with FIFA? What do you want to happen? JEAN-CLAUDE BIVER, CEO, HUBLOT: I want the truth to come out. I want clarity. I want to know what has happened. For the time being, I can only say there's a presumption of innocence. At least in Europe, that's how I think. I want to know what has happened.

We are 13 days until you the voters hit the polls. And the president is digging in on his midterm strategy, which is pretty simply go big on fear and short on facts. Case in point, the president now admitting he has, quote, in his words, ""no proof"" when it comes to his claims that a migrant caravan is filled with dangerous criminals and, quote, ""unknown Middle Easterners."" But think facts will get in the way of a narrative that he and some Republicans have used to rev up the base? Think again. SCIUTTO: Also today, the president will meet with U.S. officials returning from Saudi Arabia and Turkey to learn more about the investigation into murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi. This as the Saudi crown prince is set to speak amid mounting allegations against him and his government. We are on top of that story. Plus, move over Jeff Sessions. The Fed chairman taking another round of attacks from the president saying that Jerome Powell, quote, ""almost looks happy"" he's raising interest rates. We have a lot to get to this morning. First let's get to CNN's Abby Phillip who is at the White House this morning. Abby, what is on the president's mind as he wakes up this morning? ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning, Jim. President Trump is spending a lot more time on the campaign trail these days. But in the process, he's also making a lot of new and in many cases unsubstantiated claims. First in the recent days he's promised a big tax cut to middle class Americans, but the White House is saying there are no plans to do that any time soon. And then he on the caravan has seized on this issue that he believes is really going to be potent for Republicans this November. He's claimed, though, that there are members of ISIS or terrorist groups in this caravan. Yesterday, reporters asked the president what proof do you have of this, and here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is no proof of anything. There is no proof of anything. But they could very well be. They don't have to necessarily be in that group. But certainly you have people coming up through the southern border from the Middle East. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP: And even Vice President Mike Pence is adding to that, claiming that Venezuela and perhaps Democratic groups are organizing and financing this caravan. Again, the White House has presented no evidence to support those claims either. Meanwhile, President Trump is getting a lot of attention for his claim in a recent rally that he is now a nationalist, a term that has been associated with, you know, racial fear-mongering, perhaps white nationalist groups in the past. He acknowledged that's",0.1605947353707164,2018-10-24

You've seen those raids and the number of arrests that have been made over the past few days, the arsenal that's been uncovered in many of these locations. BERMAN: Rocket launchers in an apartment in Lyon, it's just not the kind of thing you see, you would expect to see in a country like France. Melissa Bell and Hala Gorani, thank you so much for being with us. Appreciate it. Syria's president must go. That message just coming again this morning from President Obama. We'll have much more on what he says needs to happen before ISIS can be defeated. We are live next. (MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING) ROMANS: The fight over Syrian refugees coming to America hits the House floor today. Lawmakers set to vote on a Republican backed bill that would effectively suspend the refugee resettlement program. President Obama has promised to veto; he is blasting Congress for jumping on the refugee issue, trying to, in his words, ""solve the threat of widows and orphans fleeing a war-torn land."" CNN's Michelle Kosinski traveling with the president overseas. She joins us this morning from the Philippines -- Michelle. MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hi, good morning. We heard the president go off on this plan this week, calling it irresponsible, not who we are as a nation, political posturing. Today, the administration wasn't quite so harsh. But the press secretary did call this something that isn't focused on national security so much as it is preying on fear, panic and, as he put it, cheap political calculations. So, yes, the administration is completely opposed to stopping the program even if it were a temporary pause. They said in their response to it officially, that it is just untenable. It would not add anything to national security. It would only cause unnecessary delays and chip away at the U.S.' humanitarian goal of actually helping out victims of war. There is another plan brewing in Congress over the visa waiver program. That is nations that have an agreement with the U.S. that people can travel here without getting a visa. Some in Congress, a bipartisan bill is being shaped that would put additional restrictions on that. The administration today would not go so far as to say whether they thought that was overly broad. Something like not allowing people to come here if they have been to Iraq or Syria in the last five years, as it is looking like the framework would be for this. But they are saying they would be open to tightening things up, not only on the visa waiver program, which has been called into question for years as to how that effects national security, but also on the refugee vetting itself. They don't believe in a stoppage. But they say they are open to evaluating it, tightening it up where it can be that it won't affect the program too much, in a way that's overly broad.

THORNBERRY: Well, in that area, there were signs of al Qaeda and ISIS cooperating in a way we have not seen before. I just -- I just mentioned that to highlight the danger to terrorism. We're not done with this threat. Just returned from Afghanistan a week ago. There are dangerous terrorists still in Afghanistan plotting against our homeland. TAPPER: Including ISIS. THORNBERRY: Including ISIS, and especially ISIS. So, we've got to keep the pressure on. This is a big deal, but we've got to keep the pressure on. TAPPER: And, lastly, what did you make of the president's -- he painted a very vivid picture of al-Baghdadi dying a very cowardly death, which I don't doubt for one second. A lot of these terrorists are cowards. But it was -- it was very vivid. He talked about him crying and whining, detonating a suicide vest, killing his own three children while he did so. Again, I don't -- I don't doubt that that's how he died or that he killed his own children. These people are monsters. But, I wonder if there's any part of you that said at all concerned, because now there is, of course, a question about what is ISIS going to do in response to this move, in response to perhaps the president's rhetoric? Does that concern you at all in terms of galvanizing or motivating ISIS terrorists? THORNBERRY: Oh, it probably makes me a little uncomfortable to hear a president talking that way. But, again, Baghdadi was the inspirational leader for an ISIS network across the world, from Africa to Southeast Asia. If you can take a little of the glamour off him, if you can make him less inspirational, then there's a value to that for all of these folks who are on their computers or in these networks looking to attack. But you're exactly right. ISIS will seek to do something to show, we're still here, we're still relevant. So, the United States is going to be tested in the days to come. And, as you know, one of my big concerns is, we have only funded the military for about 25 more days. We don't -- the dysfunction in Washington -- TAPPER: Yes.

He's charged with abduction in that case. Officials say the Fairfax case is linked by DNA to the 2009 disappearance of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, whose body was found near UVA. In the Fairfax case, authorities say DNA under the victim's fingernails matches Jesse Matthew's DNA. One defense attorney says the jury will rely heavily on the DNA evidence, but it's not iron-clad. MICHAEL CHICK, DEFENSE ATTORNEY It may be a degraded sample, it may be a mixture. It's always hard to tell just by hearing that it exists. That doesn't tell us everything. TODD: Another challenge for the prosecution in Fairfax, the ability of the victim to remember specific details of that night nine years ago. (END VIDEOTAPE) TODD: Now, today, Jesse Matthew's lawyers did not ask for a mental health evaluation of him, despite saying at a hearing two weeks ago that they would request that. His defense attorney Jim Camblos told me he is still discussing that possibility with his co-counsel.

And of course, to hear Jesse Matthew address the court for the first time and say not guilty in all three charges, in the abduction, in the rape and in the attempted capital murder. At this point, one way to read that -- a couple of ways. Know first that he can change that plea to guilty right up until the moment before a jury would come back. So that can always be changed. And at this point, from a defense perspective, in terms of strategy, it's just a smart thing to do. It gives you leverage in any future negotiations, should you approach the prosecution and say, OK, we might change our plea, what will you give us? SCIUTTO: Jeffrey Toobin, do you agree with that?

Will the court of arbitration for sport decide for them? We'll wait and see, but we do know the court just last week overturned lifetime bans for one-quarter of them, for 15 of these Russian athletes. There seems to be some indication the court could very well side with the Russians. But even if they side with all 60 of them, and it's a combination of athletes and coaches across a number of different sports, that doesn't mean the international Olympic committee has to let them compete in the games that is because court decisions are not binding on the IOC.

They're expected to reveal their final tweaks in the so-called manager's amendment today. It will spell out how their plan would deal with abortion funding and coverage for illegal immigrants. Democrats will post it online for 72 hours before pushing it to the floor. Well as health care reform moves forward, so is opposition to the Democrat's plan.

I just got away. MARQUEZ: Did it ever sound like there were shots coming from more than one location? ALVAREZ: They all sounded pretty much behind where I was. I was taking off. They sounded more like from the library general vicinity. But I think that was it. That's the only place I really heard from. The library, if there was anything going on inside the library, the library is sound proof. MARQUEZ: Did you see anybody afterwards? Anybody that fits the shooter's description? You didn't see anything? Where did you hide and how did you get out? ALVAREZ: Well, I noticed a lot of people were running towards the parking lot. I decided to go towards the math complex.

Abby, with your political decoder ring on, what did she just say, what didn't she say and what does it all mean? ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, we don't agonize, we organize is a very Nancy Pelosi-ism for we have got a tough road ahead and she knows that. I mean, Democrats are in the middle of a pitched battle for control of the House of Representatives, and Nancy Pelosi knows that she is the general and she cannot like leave the fight in the middle of the battle. So, it is important for her to announce that she is going to stay on in part because this cycle, 29 other Democrats have already said that they are going to retire or not run for re-election. That is almost a high watermark in recent history. And it's a real sign that many members, rank and file members, know that this is going to be really, really tough. Many headed for the exits and Democrats are trying to hold on to as many of those seats as possible.

Jean, this deposition released really just hours ago, it's changing opinions of people who supported Cosby or doubted these women. JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know, Jake, the defense fought so hard in this, because Bill Cosby said that this was a violation of his privacy rights, that the public did not have a right to know this, that it was part of a settlement agreement, confidentiality, that all sides agreed to it. But the district court judge disagreed and his alleged victims are now feeling vindicated. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CASAREZ (voice-over): One by one, they came forward. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I woke up or came to very groggily with him removing my underwear. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The room started to spin. My speech slurred. I remember him calling me over towards him. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was lying down. Cosby was on top of me, kissing me forcefully. CASAREZ: More than 25 accusers over the past 40 years. But some people had doubts. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And one of the things that getting accused of a lot of stuff when you're famous does is, it opens the door for everybody to come out and say, and me too, boss. CASAREZ: Some out-and-out disbelieved. Singer Jill Scott supported Cosby, tweeting in December, ""I'm respecting a man who has done more for the image of brown people than almost anyone ever."" Now admitting she was wrong, Scott tweeted after hearing Cosby's admission: ""Sadly, his own testimony offers proof of terrible deeds, which is all I have ever required to believe the accusations."" That testimony is from a deposition given by Cosby under oath in 2005 as part of a civil case filed that same year in Pennsylvania by Andrea Constand, an employee of Temple University, where Cosby was on the board of trustees. Constand alleged she was sexually assaulted by Cosby in 2004. ""When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?"" ""Yes."" ""Did you ever give any of these young women the quaaludes without their knowledge?"" ""Lawyer objects."" Cosby describes an encounter in Las Vegas in the '70s. ""She meets me backstage. I give her quaaludes. We then have sex."" According to ABC News, Cosby's camp said in a statement, ""The only reason Mr. Cosby settled was because it would have been embarrassing in those days to put all those women on the stand and his family had no clue. That would have been very hurtful."" Cosby's lawyer, Marty Singer, tells CNN, ""We have no knowledge who issued the statement to ABC.

PATRICIA MURPHY, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, ""THE DAILY BEAST"": I went into bars across the state, and they are concerned. They are worried. The bar owners I spoke with we don't think guns and alcohol are a good mix. Many of these bar owners own guns themself and even carry guns themself to tamp things down just in case. They don't want the responsibility of either saying you cannot bring guns into my bar by placing a sign, or even having the responsibility of removing somebody who has a gun. It's their legal right to ask somebody to leave, but I talked to bar owners I don't want to ask a drunk guy with a gun to leave. They feel like it puts them in a difficult position. They have the legal right to keep guns out, but they also have the responsibility to sort of police it themselves and they are not comfortable with that especially when you have alcohol, late night, and guns. You can just sort of imagine where it could go. COSTELLO: Well, those who favor gun rights laws say, you could carry a conceal weapon in a restaurant in Georgia and that's been in effect for a long time and there's been no trouble. Well, and that's true, there have been for the last four years, most Georgian's do not know this for by the way, a lot of restaurants have bars inside of them. Georgia legally defines that by the percentage of sales that you have based on alcohol, how would a patron know if you go into an apple bees, is it legally a gun or a restaurant. And the gun owners who say I don't want to get arrested just because I go into a restaurant that counts as a bar because they sell more alcohol than food. It's private property.

AMANPOUR: You are the son of the man who most describe as the greatest leader Canada has had in modern times, Pierre Elliott Trudeau. What is that burden like? TRUDEAU: It was a bit more of a burden when I was younger, for me, because you know, being young and growing up is all about trying to forge your own identity. And for so many people, my father was such a larger than life image that you agreed with, that you disagreed with. It was inconceivable that I might go into politics, because I would constantly be compared to my father. So I went off and did all sorts of different things. I was a schoolteacher. I traveled the world. I was an activist on environmental and youth issues. And I'd always say to myself, if I go into politics, it will be much later in life. But then I realized, you know what, we need young people in politics. And I had learned enough about my own style to know that I have a very different approach to things, to people than my father did. So yes, I'll be compared.

Anna Politkovskaya was an outspoken critic of government policies in Chechnya. She had made some powerful enemies, and was rumored to be preparing a series of reports from Chechnya. Matthew Chance has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Grainy images of a man police say could be the killer of one of the Kremlin's most outspoken critics. Captured on closed-circuit television cameras, few believe he was anything more than a hired gone. Anna Politkovskaya, a prominent Russian journalist, was found slumped in the elevator of her Moscow apartment building, shot four times in the head and chest. Prosecutors say it looks like a contract killing, linked to her work. A determined investigative reporter and a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, Anna made powerful enemies. Her reporting of Russia's war in Chechnya was relentless. She was one of the only independent Russian journalists who continued to travel there, exposing human rights abuses despite the risks. ""Each time I return from Chechnya, I appreciate my life,"" she says. ""I love my life, because it can be finished at any time."" On occasion, Anna stepped outside the role of journalist, negotiating with Chechnyan militants, who took hundreds of hostages in a Moscow theater in 2002. In 2004, during the Beslan school siege, she believed she had been poisoned to prevent her from covering what turned out to be a fiasco with more than 130 killed. As a mother of two, she spent time outside Russia to protect her family from death threats. She often spoke to colleagues about what she believed was the official campaign of intimidation against her. PAVEL FELGENHAUER, JOURNALIST: Russia is an authoritarian, aggressive leadership where people who are trying to write real journalism are constantly under threat.

Todd Kendhammer called 911 in late October after he claimed that a pipe fell off a flatbed truck and hit his wife while they were driving. How horrible! Take a listen to his call.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, a pipe or something came through our windshield, a pipe did. (END AUDIO CLIP) BANFIELD: Sounds plausible, right? He told the officers that his wife, Barbara, (ph) was killed when that pipe fell off that truck and went through the windshield and struck her. Then something just didn`t add up. You know those pesky forensics? Yes. Well, according to the medical examiner`s reports, Barbara`s injuries were not consistent with a single blow from a single pipe from a single flatbed truck. Then came the accident reconstruction. Yes, that happened, too, and it poked even more holes in Kendhammer`s story, and now he is facing charges that he killed her, that it was him. Michael Christian`s a PRIMETIME JUSTICE producer. He`s been working this story all day. So here`s what I`m so fascinated by. When you start getting those forensics in, it tells a whole other story, Michael. In fact, at one point, he was talking about that she`d been hit in the head and that there was something wrong with her throat. That`s what he told the 911 operator. But then the actual physical forensic inconsistencies include the fact that there was no blood on the pipe. There were scratches on the defendant`s chest. Let`s put up a list of all of these things that didn`t match up. Blood of the victim was on the rear passenger tire. There was glass in the gear shift. Michael, why does that matter that there was glass found in the actual gear shift? MICHAEL CHRISTIAN, PRIMETIME JUSTICE PRODUCER: Because investigators say, Ashleigh, that the glass could only have been in the gear shift the way it was in the if the car had been in park. Well, if this is a car going down the road when it`s all of a sudden hit by this errant pipe, it`s not going to be in park. It`s going be in drive. BANFIELD: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Pesky forensics. And then on the passenger seat, theoretically where Barbara was struck, there was a whole bunch of glass -- do we have that picture? -- a bunch of scattered shattered glass on the seat. Now, had she been sitting there, it wouldn`t have been there, right? CHRISTIAN: That`s right. BANFIELD: OK.

The 20,000 new jobs by the start of the next decade and in keeping with the theme, we have been emphasizing this week, Scotland's space strategy looks to address issues here on Earth from reducing emissions to supporting the use of satellite data for environmental monitoring. The UAE has one of the most ambitious space programs globally. Already it has a spacecraft orbiting Mars, seeking to understand the Martian climate and now the country has set its sights on sending a probe to Venus and beyond to study an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. I sat down with Sarah Al Amiri, the head of the UAE's space agency earlier to talk about the vision that the UAE has for its space project and why. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARAH AL AMIRI, CHAIR, UAE SPACE AGENCY: So we started our space endeavor as one of the areas by which we'll work to diversifying our economy. The space sector provided us with the capability to develop engineering and science skills together in one program and one project. What the exploration program allowed us to do is expedite that development. What our continuation in the space exploration program will provide us is with an impact on the economy. As you know, the space sector has a wide and far-reaching impact on the -- on society as a whole. You see a vast transformation into the way of working when you know you can achieve getting to Mars. But we've also seen great implications on the private sector. On the Mars mission we started early on, dabbling on seeing some of our manufacturing companies can manufacture parts for the Mars mission. It's right now around Mars in the Hope probe, manufactured parts in the Emirates. We never thought that was possible. Now we're looking at a mission that you mentioned, how to build further on the private sector. The space economy, as you know, is an economy that is vibrant and will thrive over the next decade. The UAE is going to play a part in the Earth observations here and also with regard to communications satellites. We will continue our efforts in building and diversifying our economy. ANDERSON: You talk about Earth observation. There will be viewers who don't understand exactly what that means. You've talked about it being an inexpensive gateway in. Just explain what you mean by that. AMIRI: This observation is any form, be it for climate purposes, weather purposes, for imaging purposes, for urban planning, for farming, for getting better farming practices. What the lower cost of launch has enabled us to do is to send more satellites into space, to image Earth. AMIRI: Right now, it's near real time. What that means is if you want to start a business in space, you no longer need to own a satellite. You get access to data that is available from various companies around the world and you produce your products and services based on this.",0.3951576375230943,2021-10-20

GRACE: Now, David, in the 911 call what kind of details do we believe she gave? GAMBACORTA: Well, Bonnie supposedly ran through a whole scenario where her car was struck and she and her daughter were placed in the trunk of this car and she repeatedly stated her daughter was with her and they were riding around somewhere, she wasn`t quite sure where they were, and she gave the 911 operators instructions on how to get in touch with her husband.

Turned out she did it. In this case the child apparently is alive. I wonder if she could actually give a description of the mysterious black men, Matt Zarrell. What do we know? ZARRELL: Well, we know that law enforcement sources told CNN that video surveillance captured Bonnie and the 9-year-old at the Philadelphia International Airport, which is about eight miles from where the car, the family`s Yukon Denali was found late last night. Now we know that they were boarding a flight we believe from Orlando and now subsequently the report has been issued that they have been found. GRACE: Mike Brooks, dare I say it? It`s a small world.

BROOKS: Nancy, this story stunk from the first time I heard it, especially when I heard their car, the SUV, was found at 15th and Chestnut in downtown Philadelphia, five blocks away from where the cell phone call was made. Now why did she wait that long to make the cell phone call? It was found at 2:00 a.m. the ticket on the car. There was -- somebody wrote a parking ticket. It goes back to the afternoon.

Who matters more than you and your democracy? The questions -- who are we, what are we about, what do we tolerate, what do we condemn, how much do we decide which of those fates is fair, and how do we make those decisions -- this is heady stuff, and we are dealing with confusion in our political culture right now on all of those points. It is not just about what may have happened or not at a party with kids many years ago. We know we're not going to be able to be absolutely sure about that, not in this context, not at this time. But we can be very sure about how we guide ourselves in handling it now.

EARNEST: These forces do not have a combat mission. This is not, in any way, an attempt to diminish the risks that they will face or the bravery that they will need to summon to carry out these operations.

The U.S. will use F-15 and A-10 jets at nearby Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to strike targets around Raqqah, the ISIS capital. The U.S. wants anti-ISIS forces to be able to take back the city.

There was talking about governance, and keeping state institutions intact. Now, everybody that follows Syria knows that the regime and the institutions of the state are very closely together.

About 23 percent of those people were independents. 4 percent say they were Republicans. So we have Republican women coming in to vote for Hillary Clinton and yet a lot of young people coming in to vote for Barack Obama and South Carolinians in upper part of the state voting heavily for their native son John Edwards.

Three-fourths of whites voted for white candidates and close to 80 percent of blacks voted for Barack Obama. Why was it anything other than a race primary? CLYBURN: Because this is the first time that African-Americans in the country got a chance to vote. He came in. He have to win in the victory up in Iowa and would be says that he was the white candidate? No. He won because he reached out. He tapped into people's hopes and their aspirations, their dreams, and I think the same thing happened here in South Carolina. There's a lady of 104 years old going to the polls, with an Obama T-shirt on. This lady has been waiting all of her life for an opportunity to do this. That's the kind of pride all of us know the history of this country and of South Carolina. And it was a source of pride for so many elderly African-American women to get an opportunity to vote for someone of color who has a chance of being president. Now, that ought not be shied away from. HARRIS: So what came out of South Carolina for you last night that suggests that Barack Obama can move forward and I say that mindful of the fact that you haven't endorsed a candidate?

And that energy sector Michael, is responsible for about 40 percent of their federal budget in Russia. So we cannot tolerate these-- SMERCONISH: Yes but - OK. ALPEROVITCH: --the status quo on here. SMERCONISH: I think he already gave him that warning. I mean, it's like they're already on double secret probation. Now it would seem something needs to be done. ALPEROVITCH: I think the time may come, at which point we have to start enforcing the sanctions, absolutely. SMERCONISH: Dmitri Alperovitch, thank you so much for being here. ALPEROVITCH: Thank you. SMERCONISH: Old Glory, I saw a lot of our beautiful American flag this Independence Day weekend. It represents the best about us, what unites us. But one ""New York Times"" reporter also notes that it's become a divisive symbol of sorts. And she is here to explain, next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TEXT: CUOMO PRIME TIME. (END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TEXT: LET'S GET AFTER IT. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMERCONISH: Question, can we discern a person's political leaning by whether they're displaying an American flag? The Stars and Stripes represent unity, the blood and sacrifice that went into making this great nation. But it's growingly become a symbol of division for some. A ""New York Times"" article documents how some Americans are worried that others are co-opting the flag as a political symbol. The story reads as follows. ""Today, flying the American flag from the back of a pickup truck or over a lawn is increasingly seen as a clue, albeit an imperfect one, to a person's political affiliation in a deeply divided nation."" The journalist behind the story, who wrote it, Staff Reporter for ""The Times,"" Sarah Maslin Nir, joins me now. Sarah, thank you so much for being here. I know that in some quarters, this has taken on a ""How dare you even raise this observation or impugn someone's reputation by noting this?"" For what it's worth, a week ago, on my radio program, I was asking the same question. What accounts for the blowback? SARAH MASLIN NIR, STAFF REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Well, it's fascinating, right? There is a conflation with the journalist, who's really a conduit, for public sentiment, and public experience, to be the person whose",0.3510826401371065,2021-07-05

I don't think that means that quantitative easing, as Central Bank call it, was a mistake. I think it frankly helped avoid the vortex of the 1930s depression. That is no small thing. But wouldn't it have been better everywhere if parliaments, Congress had stepped up and say, well, we're going to do a bit of redistribution, so that people don't - so that we select the losers and the winners rather than the people down in the central banks. AMANPOUR: It's fascinating because I don't think this story is over. I mean, I was told in France, for instance, that even though President Macron won in this economic climate, in this anti-globalization climate, in this climate of the rise of populism that unless he delivers economically, his own people are saying these populists like Marine Le Pen and the others are waiting in ambush. That's their quote. TUCKER: He has to succeed. He has to succeed. And it's the same in the United States. There are many people like kind of disenchanted with President Trump. If he fails, the next round may be even worse on either the right or the left. We don't really know how to operate full franchised democracy successfully in a world with very low growth. And the reason for that is, if you have zero growth, it's a zero-sum game. You are only better off if I am worse off. We, in this room, in the studio are only better off if everybody outside it is worse off. This country is only better off if the rest of the world is worse off. Zero growth is toxic. And the biggest problem we all face is reviving dynamism and productivity growth. And no one has a magic wand for doing that, but least of all my tribe. The tribe of central bankers, they can deliver stability, but they can't deliver prosperity. AMANPOUR: So, Paul Tucker, thank you very much indeed. TUCKER: Thank you. AMANPOUR: And indeed, we can never predict how these global economic trends or geostrategy will play out actually on the ground, but last night's primary election hints that a change may be rippling through Texas. For the very first time, Democrats there chose a Latina, the former Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez to run against the state's deeply conservative and highly popular Republican Governor Greg Abbott. Valdez is also Texas' first openly gay nominee for governor. And while it may seem like political suicide, consider this. Texas, like California, is a majority minority state with a booming Hispanic population. America's largest red state could soon flip blue. That is according to my next guest, Lawrence Wright. He is the award-winning writer and reporter. His 2006 book ""The Looming Tower"" is widely considered the definitive account of events leading up to 9/11.

I walked around the Capitol Complex as I often do, but today in those seven foot fences, the razor wire on top, they're all over the place. You can't get close to it. We learned more, Congressman, today about the timeline of the January 6, the Capitol attack with the head of the D.C. National Guard testifying took more than three hours to deploy the National Guard. How disturbed are you by these details? HIMES: It's very disturbing, Wolf. Very disturbing. Look, there's two huge questions about January 6. One is, how was the Capitol so incredibly unprepared. I mean, I will just never forget the images of officers dressed mostly in their street clothes, you know, no body armor, no helmets, no nothing standing behind those little bicycle stand fences, completely unprepared. So that's question number one. Question number two, of course, is by about 1:30, when it was really clear that the Capitol was going to be overrun, how in the world did it take three hours? Wolf, I think to myself, because I was in the chamber that day, thank God, it was a disorganized mob. And yes, there were people there who were probably armed, there were people who were intent on doing very violent things, but this was not a trained group of assailants. I mean, if this had been 50 terrorists, let's just say that somehow ISIS managed to get, you know, 50 trained, hardened terrorists who understood tactical formations and were heavily armed. Under those circumstances, we would have had hundreds of people dead, and it would take three hours to move significant security into the Capitol. That's obviously just not acceptable. And we need to really understand why that's true and make sure that it never happens again. BLITZER: It's hard to believe this could have happened right here in the nation's capital of the States of America. Representative Himes, thanks so much for joining us.

But what is the buzz in the business world about Steve Jobs leave of absence? CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The buzz right now -- obviously this is health related absence. The stock has done well after initial pullbacks. He had pancreatic cancer a few years ago and a liver transplant. And the company very brief statement yesterday, but we know there are ups and downs after you had a liver transplant and he's apparently on one of those downs. I want to show you the stock. The stock has had basically nothing but ups underneath Steve Jobs' leadership as he has really transformed technology and the way consumers use music and information. That's what the stock was doing when he underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in 2004. The stock price was $14.89. Then by January 14th 2009, he announced a medical leave at that time and stock was up to $85 a share.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Let's get back to our CNN political contributors, Democratic strategist, Paul Begala and Republican strategist, Mary Matalin. Both of whom have worked in the White House. In the scheme of things, if the president wants to get himself re-elected, how important is tonight's ""State of the Union"" address, Paul? BEGALA: It's huge, it's big. You know, it's the biggest thing you know is going to happen. Presidential campaigns always turn on these moments of strength. Sometimes they're unpredictable, you don't know when they're going to happen, but sometimes they are. Tonight, the president has the chance. This is for an old White House aide like me, and I'm sure for Mary, this is like the Super Bowl of the World Series and Willie Nelson concert rolled all in one. I'm thrilled. I was even thrilled to see Republican presidents give the speech. BLITZER: Tens and millions of Americans will be watching tonight, a lot more Americans, Mary, you'll be watching the president deliver this 45-minute or so speech tonight as opposed to watched last night's Republican debate or any of the Republican debates, for that matter. MATALIN: Yes, that's right, but although they are big speeches and they are the political junky's Super Bowl -- go Giants, didn't want to miss that opportunity -- no one will make their decision tonight how they're going to vote in the fall. No matter how great the speech and I don't doubt the president will give yet another wonderful speech, they're looking at their lives, and three quarters of Americans think their future will not be brighter. And that Obama, well, it's not his fault, he has made economic circumstance worst that's his biggest challenge for the year. By definition, ""State of the Unions"" in a campaign year in are a frame- up, and he will do that and do it well. I don't know that it's going to have legs beyond next week the way this campaign has been unfolding. BLITZER: We'll soon find out.

I would be insisting that he set up an independent election commission to review whether the upcoming parliamentary election is going to be fair and is credible. And I would be suggesting he try to work out something with the Supreme Court in terms of reinstating the court and how they would reinstate it. But I think you could probably drag that out a little bit. I think it matters how Musharraf would say and do these things. But I think he can lift martial law in the context of what I just said. And I think Bhutto would probably -- her party would probably go along. CROWLEY: Do you think, at this point, the U.S. ought to be thinking about putting more troops on the border with Pakistan? BIDEN: Absolutely. I've been saying that, Candy, for a long time now. And if you're Musharraf, and you see the last two years our entire attention being diverted to Iraq, us not being in a position where we look like we're really in it to stay in Afghanistan, then you start cutting your own deals. So I would, as president, be using this -- what is referred to now as the Biden Exit Plan -- getting us the hell out of Iraq, leaving something stable behind, but beefing up -- beefing up our capacity along the border. That would, in turn, embolden our NATO allies to be more participatory with us. And that would then put us in the position, if we had actionable intelligence -- the fancy phrase, I know you know it -- actionable intelligence -- that we would, if Musharraf was not cooperating, I would not hesitate to act if I knew I had a target and knew my prospects of success were real. CROWLEY: So you would go into Pakistan? BIDEN: Well, I would under those circumstances. But I think what would happen is if that kind of action took place, you would see Musharraf emboldened then.

In some cases, if you look at the vote to impeach, for example, there were members who told me they were afraid for their own security, afraid in some instances for their lives. (END VIDEO CLIP) ACOSTA: Yeah, I think back to Howard Baker and what happened during Watergate, the legendary Tennessee senator who essentially went down to Richard Nixon or told Richard Nixon, that's it, the jig is up. In this day and age, Howard Baker would be thrown out the way Liz Cheney is being ostracized by her party. Does it have to do with, you know, Nixon and Trump always thinking that they have political enemies and that these enemies have to be afraid of them? DEAN: I think it's more the radicalization of the base of the party and the leaders that are not radical or afraid of the base. Those who are radical are comfortable with them, and want them to continue projecting that radical image, and trying to give it some legitimacy. The people at the hearings that have been pushing these weird perceptions of what happened on January 6th are radicals. So that's the only explanation, that we're down to a very radical Republican parties that has little connection with reality, Jim. The moderates and thinking Republicans, they're not in that group anymore. They're talking about -- I talk to a lot of them. They're trying to figure, do we start a new father?

There are 13 presidential candidates but polls show the race is between the right-wing national party and the left wing liberty and refoundation party. Corruption and poverty the two biggest issues. Right now, more than 50 percent of Hondurans live below the poverty line. There are also concerns of potential unrest, if the victor does now win by a clear margin. Now the vote in Honduras is just the latest test facing Latin America as authoritarian trends spark concerns that democracy is being eroded across the region. CNN's Matt Rivers reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If you are a fan of democracy, November has been a very bad month in Latin America. The latest example, Venezuela, which held local and regional elections on Sunday. President Nicolas Maduro claiming victory for his party, which won 21 of 24 state governorships. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking foreign language). RIVERS (voice-over): He says the result is because of our hard work and our honesty. Critics, though, and the outcome was already determined. The vote can't be trusted, they say, in a country where Maduro controls state institutions. Allegations of course, to voting and violence against opposition members, during yesterday's vote have already surfaced. And then, there is Nicaragua, where, on November 7th, president Daniel Ortega won another term in what can only be described as sham elections. His regime unleashed a campaign of political terror back in June, arresting any prominent would-be opposition candidates and tossing them in jail. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking foreign language). RIVERS (voice-over): Those in jail are sons of (INAUDIBLE) of the imperialist Yankees, he says. They're no longer Nicaraguans. We even tried to get into Nicaragua ourselves to see what was happening there. But authorities deported my team and me after just a few hours. In his victory speech, Ortega spoke about journalists like us. ""These scoundrels want to come cover the elections, we already know they're employees of the American intelligence agencies."" So Ortega wins a fourth consecutive term and Nicaraguan democracy is on life support. RIVERS: But it's not just those three countries that are having problems. This is a map from Freedom House, a pro-democracy research group. And each country is given a score that measures it's liberal democracy. Green, means an improving score and, as you can see, there's not a lot of green on this map.

I mean, John McCain is the one who really gets people excited, particularly outside the Republican Party and some Republicans.

And so, Sara, what's the deal? SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're hearing from a number of states who say they've heard from the federal government that their upcoming vaccine allocations of this Pfizer vaccine are going to be reduced. Now obviously, this is a concern to them. We know that this is in tight supply already. So any time those number go down, it's pretty alarming for the state officials to see. Now Pfizer is saying, look, this is not a production issue on our end. They said in a statement that they have millions more doses sitting in a warehouse but as of now they haven't received shipment instructions for the additional doses. Officials in the government are telling us, look, this is not about reducing the number of doses that states are going to get. This is about trying to spread this out over the course of the week so that there's kind of, you know, a cascade of doses states will be receiving throughout the week. But look, this is really frustrating for state officials. We know that the Pfizer vaccine is really complicated. Has to be kept at these ultra-cold conditions. It has to be thawed. It has to be used pretty quickly after that.

HARRIS: Oh, yes. WILLIS: Well, if you go to secretsanta.org you can have your kids drop off those extra toys that they already have, that they're not using, for somebody else who really needs them and may not be able to afford them. It's secretsanta.org. A great place to hook up with somebody who's going to give your toys to someone who needs them. HARRIS: That's great. And, you know, there are a lot of Web sites out there. First of all, there are a lot of charities and thankfully there are a lot of Web sites that you can go to and visit to find out if those charities are doing the job they're supposed to do. WILLIS: Well, you know what the big problem here is, is that some of these charities, not much of your money, frankly, goes to the people who need it most. HARRIS: Right. WILLIS: That's what you need to check out. Now you can do that at Web sites like guidestar.org, charitynavigator.org or give.org. All of those will help you evaluate the charity that you want to give to. Keep in mind that you want at least 60 percent of your dollar to go right to the people who need it. And don't forget, Tony, this is a tax break for you. Even though you're giving it away as a gift, you get to write it off. HARRIS: Oh, that's right. Love it! Love it!

This man is a convicted sexual offender, seen here with his attorney. He asked not to be identified by name. Days before getting out of prison, a judge ordered him into civil commitment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is double jeopardy. You're not able to live on your own free will. You're locked up 24/7. It's no different than being in jail or in prison. BOLDUAN: One of the few ever released from civil commitment, he says he now lives a quiet life, albeit under constant surveillance. (on camera): Some people when they see this story, they'll say it doesn't matter. A sexual offender is too dangerous and should be locked up forever. Are they wrong? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Many of them are wrong. That is a misconception, that all sex offenders are going to repeat, and all sex offenders should be locked away for the rest of their lives. BOLDUAN (voice over): Twelve years ago, the Supreme Court said state civil commitment laws are constitutional if the goal is treatment, not punishment. Now, the court will decide if this can apply to federal prisoners, raising questions of whether civil commitment should be allowed at all. About 20 states allow civil commitment for sexual offenders. An estimated 4,000 are being held. The reality? There's a human cost on both sides. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I had served my time for what I did. And I didn't feel like that I should be incarcerated again.

In a very bizarre twist, cops say they`ve arrested the missing children`s grandmother in Tennessee on unrelated drug trafficking charges, and they plan to extradite her to Alaska for questioning in the family`s mysterious disappearance. Could this granny, this grandma hold the key to finding this beautiful family before it`s too late? Good evening, I`m Jane Velez-Mitchell, coming to you live. Thanks for joining me. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have no idea what`s going on. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On May 27, 37-year-old Brandon Jividen, 22-year-old Rebecca or Becca Adams and her two daughters, 5-year-old Michelle and 3- year-old Jarraca Hundley went missing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The missing persons investigation has been a top priority. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We want them be found. We want to know they`re OK, that the girls are OK. We want them home. (END VIDEOTAPE) VELEZ-MITCHELL: Cops say the family of four -- Brandon Jividen, his girlfriend Rebecca Adams and her two beautiful daughters, ages 5 and 3 -- just vanished off the face of the earth three weeks ago. Investigators say the couple left both of their cars behind. They didn`t pack any bags at all. They didn`t even take their wallets. And tonight we`re learning that breakfast was even left right out on the table. They lived in a rugged, wooded area in Alaska, and they vanished without taking any camping gear whatsoever. Their cell phones have gone dead. Even the family dog is missing with them. Now in a stunning turn of events, Lisa Hundley, the woman you`re looking at there -- that`s, I believe, her rap sheet. The grandmother of the two missing girls and former mother-in-law of the missing woman, she`s arrested on unrelated contempt of court charges connected with a 2010 drug possession and trafficking conviction. Now U.S. marshals are hauling that granny from Tennessee all the way to Alaska to grill her. They say she`s not a suspect but hope she can give investigators, quote, ""more perspective on the family itself,"" end quote. So why doesn`t she just get on a plane for her own interests? Why is she being extradited? Lisa is the paternal grandmother of the two missing little girls. Her son was in a relationship with their mom, Rebecca Adams, the woman who`s missing, before he died in a motorcycle accident two years ago. Some published reports are speculating and suggesting that perhaps the missing woman and the grandmother were in a feud, fighting over money.

A barrier of extra salty water that kept marine life from passing from the Red Sea to here in the Mediterranean Sea.

WALTER BACKSTROM, MCCAIN WASHINGTON STATE CO-CHAIR: Bobbie, welcome from Washington State. BATTISTA: Well, thanks very much and thanks for joining us. Glad you got here. Let me refer to that sound bite about the Republican -- the Republican flag, sorry. The Confederate flag. (CROSSTALK) I'm just curious. How are the Republican candidates addressing the issues that are facing black America today and why are they perceived as not being more vigorous in that pursuit? BACKSTROM: Bobbie, before I respond, let me tell you that Senator McCain is anxious and willing to debate Ambassador Keyes and Governor Bush at the Apollo Theater, and I hope to accompany him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That makes two out of three. BACKSTROM: Well, yes. If Bush will be there, I'm sure Senator McCain will be there. I think we addressed the issue around the flag on Bob Jones University, I think it's important that I tell you at one time I was Bush -- I was one of Bush's speakers. But when Bush -- when Governor Bush went to South Carolina and to Bob Jones University and spoke there about the new conservatism -- and I am a conservative -- and he spoke at a place where discrimination basically plays its dirty hand, John McCain said he would never have gone to Bob Jones University -- because I am Roman Catholic, I am a black conservative, and I have a grandfather who was Caucasian. So I think when we talk about Republicans and opening up or broadening the tent, I think what George Bush did was wrong and he should never have gone there, and John McCain pledged and said he would never have gone to Bob Jones University. So I think we look at -- we look at -- look at Republican Party politics not just in context of the flag, but in a larger context: what are we going to do for black America, but more importantly, what are we going to go for America. As I listened to the debate between Al Gore and his opponent, Al Gore's campaign manager, Donna Brazile, said the Republican Party brings out black kids for photo ops but only wants to harm black kids.

Putting it back in perspective here, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, local time, there were reports of shots being fired at Granite Hills High School. A local police officer assigned to the school heard the shooting, went and confronted the alleged shooter. There was a bit of a shoot-out there. The officer was able however, to bring the suspect, almost immediately, into custody and had already called for backup assistance so other emergency assistance was readily available and they moved quickly. Then the school was brought down into a lockdown situation.

What makes something that's not just a good dinnertime story? ANN PATCHETT, AUTHOR, ""THESE PRECIOUS DAYS"": I think that it's when you can take the personal and the personal then takes a jump to the universal. So, to me, a good essay is when I'm writing about something very specific that happened in my life that wouldn't have any particular connection, and yet it jumps forward. I think about the essay in this book called ""Flight Plan,"" which is about the fact that my husband has been flying since he was 10 years old. And it's a little nerve-wracking to me, as the wife. That's a circumstance that most people don't find themselves in. But it becomes an essay about marriage, or really any relationship where there may be something that the person that you really love is doing that makes you uncomfortable, but you don't get to pick them apart and decide they're allowed to do this, or they're not allowed to do that. So, in my mind, that's what makes a good essay. AMANPOUR: And this book is full of them. And it really is so, so interesting, and it's got quite a lot of amazing commentary around it now. And there's, as I say, so many different stories. But you did also -- I mean, here we are in the middle of the pandemic.

CNN's David McKenzie joins us from Nairobi, Kenya. David, bring us up to speed on what is going on in Mogadishu. DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Ali, a great deal of violence is going on in Mogadishu. There have been two days of insurgency activity. Al Shabab (ph), an al Qaeda-linked group is trying to overthrow the government there has been attacking African union forces, attacking government troops. And also staging this brazen attack in daylight at a hotel that was popular with government officials. Six MPs killed in what was a combined gun-and-suicide attack. And certainly a very high death toll. Over 30 people killed in that attack in Mogadishu. Ali. VELSHI: Let's just talk about this. Six of those people were members of Parliament who were killed. What kind of functioning government does Somalia actually have right now? MCKENZIE: Ali, it's a very weak functioning government. The transitional federal government came in a few years ago. It's tries to maintain power, but really they only hold on to a couple of installations within the capital of Mogadishu. And those installations only survive, really, because of an African Union peacekeeping force there. And Al Shabab is really controlling a large part of the southern part of the country. Security analysts and foreign government is very worried because Al Shabab basically has become a harbor for international terrorist groups, including people coming as far up field even as from the U.S. (INAUDIBLE). And they have more of a pan- regional terror aim than just trying to take over the country. In July, they attacked people watching the World Cup finals in Kampala. So, certainly, they're showing they can operate outside of Somalia. And it's a group we should definitely watch closely.

Let's go straight to the Pentagon to Chris Lawrence. Chris, what does this mean? The Pentagon is letting go the capability of fighting these two ground wars simultaneously? CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Brooke, you could argue they never really had that capability. I mean, if you look the Army had to add some 90,000 soldiers just to get through the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; and those countries weren't fighting with the navy or air force of any means. But what this in policy means is that the United States will focus on being able to fight one sustained ground combat operation, while still having enough troops left to what they call spoil-that's the new buzz word-spoil the intentions of a second adversary. In other words, if the U.S. was involved in a ground combat, major ground combat in the Korean Peninsula and Iran started acting up, they could deploy enough forces, or make it enough of a deterrent to Iran to hold them at bay, or hold that off, until those ground forces could be redeployed. But overall, what this strategy does, probably pulls some troops out of Europe, rebalances the force and really puts a lot more emphasis into Asia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will be strengthening our presence in the Asia-Pacific and budget reductions will not come at the expense of that critical region. (END VIDEO CLIP) LAWRENCE: Critics say this ignores history, that when you say oh, there won't be the number of ground conflicts, it really ignores how ground conflicts continue to pop up. It also says critics will say it will make allies wonder about our commitment and embolden some of the U.S.'s enemies. BALDWIN: I'm wondering about the 47,000 soldiers and Marines? In terms of those troop reductions, where do they go? LAWRENCE: Yeah, if the Pentagon has its way, if some officials get their way, that will be done very carefully. Stretched out over time, so that some could leave on their own, that were planning to get out of the service any way. Retirements can happen. Things like that. Because what they don't want to do, if it's done too quickly, is you push all these mid-career people out into a horrible civilian economy. It has the effect of basically laying off a lot of these soldiers. So what they want to do is sort of stretch this out. But really, Brooke, the elephant in the room is the rising cost, the personnel costs, of paying for troops and their families. The pay, the housing, the benefits, the retirement. Those costs are spiraling and really long-term, it's pretty unsustainable. So current troops, probably, their commitment, their retirement, probably safe.

So, I think what we're beginning to see now is back in the states on two fronts, both by sitting Democratic governors, Democratic election officials, and candidates who are Democrats in office in some key states, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin, to try to fortify the voting rights laws, protect the voting rights laws or block restrictive legislation in those states. Also a nationwide effort by voting reform advocates and electoral advocates, civil rights leaders, people like Michelle Obama and her group to try to maximize turnout and enthusiasm, because there's basically a recognition that the magic hasn't been in Congress. PHILLIP: At least not at the federal level. You know, also in response to President Biden's speech on voting rights in Atlanta, Republicans came out and they said we don't recognize this guy who gave this speech, claiming he went too far. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Restoring the soul of America has become this. Agree with me or you're a bigot. SEN.

I mean, lord knows everybody I know has tried, but he's become obsessed with this. I just hate to see him go out this way. And I can't understand it. I just scratch my head and think what has become of this person. It's not a bad thing to run, because I think people have a right to run for president as third parties.

Iraqi troops in full retreat after the terrorists used armored bulldozers and suicide bombers to storm the city. Ramadi is just 70 miles west of Baghdad.

The United States says that Iran poses an imminent threat in the Middle East but the real battle may be brewing inside the White House. Sources telling CNN President Trump is irritated with the growing impression that his advisers are pushing him towards war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, are we going to war with Iran? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I hope not. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOWELL: And then just a few minutes later Mr. Trump met with the president of Switzerland which represents U.S. interest in Iran. Sources say that he is trying to get open a diplomatic channel between the Swiss. He said publicly he wants Iranian leaders to call him. The Trump administration has briefed top congressional leaders on what they call evidence of Iranian threats. CNN's Barbara Starr has the details from the Pentagon. BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: U.S. officials say that there are multiple images now showing Iranian freighters with their decks cut out and gaping areas underneath the decks that are being use they believe, to carry Iranian missiles and other ammunitions. And that these freighters have moved in and out of Iranian ports in recent days, leading the U.S. to conclude that this is part of the Iranian potential planning for a possible attack against U.S. forces in the region. But this is very different than Iran's traditional weapon snuggling up and down the gulf. There are also smaller Iranian boats known as dhows that are moving through these waters also with weapons on board. So, what the U.S. worries about is that Iran is essentially weaponizing shipping, commercial shipping in critical Gulf waters that rely on very much free unrestricted travel by commercial shipping which carries billions of dollars of goods in and out of the area every year. The U.S. very clear it says that it is not looking for war with Iran but the U.S. aircraft carrier strike group the B-52 bombers are in the region as a deterrent measure to show Iran that they would be a very heavy U.S. military price to pay if they were to an act any plan to attack U.S. troops, U.S. interest in the region.

Vafa Anderson, a teacher at an international school in that city, joining me on the line. Vafa, there are concerns now by the crews that have suspended their efforts to put out the fire because they don't know what is burning right now. Have you been told anything by officials at this point? Any concern they have expressed to you? VAFA ANDERSON (voice-over), INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL TEACHER IN TIANJIN, CHINA: I haven't really heard much from them other than what's on the news about what happened. There have been reports that, you know, we should wear our masks when we go outside, just to be careful about the air. Other than that, no, not really. VAUSE: How close are you living to the actual blast site? How much damage was done to where you live? ANDERSON: That's a very good question. I'm one to two kilometers away from the blast site. We woke up to the first blast and went to check out what was happening of course out the window and saw huge exPLOsion. We have line of sight from where it happened. Only few buildings in the way and the shock wave just blew through our apartment. It blew out the glass. It blew out the doors. You know, just knocked everything over. Knocked out the power. It has really damaged a lot of buildings in my complex that were facing that side and other complexes that were facing other directions. These complexes are 33 floors tall. The windows in all of the apartments are blown out. So it's quite substantial what's happened. VAUSE: So there was flying glass, essentially in your apartment, like in so many other apartments last night in Tianjin. (CROSSTALK) VAUSE: Were you hurt at all? ANDERSON: Was I hurt? Yes. I was standing near the window and had my hand on the curtains when the glass blew and cut my hand open pretty bad. I have cuts all over my legs. My wife cut her feet pretty badly and her arm. Just glass and shrapnel kind of exploded everywhere. VAUSE: We know there were two explosions, the first not as powerful as the second. What did you think when you first heard that blast and then there was a second incredibly powerful exPLOsion? What was your first thought that may be the cause of all of this? ANDERSON: Yeah, at first, I thought -- first, I thought a bomb went off. Of course, there's nothing like that in China. So I knew something terrible had happened.

DAVID STERRITT, ""CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR"": Hi there. ARENA: Well, let's start with ""Charlie's Angels."" Is it as good as the first? STERRITT: Oh, you know, the first was not exactly a cinematic masterpiece, and neither is the second one. But you know... ARENA: It's fun, fun, summer fun. STERRITT: Exactly. You don't go to any of these movies, or any of these sequels or spin-offs for high art, you go there just to have a good time. And certainly, you know, the women who are top-lining this movie, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, are all -- they just know exactly what they're doing, they're fun to look at, they have a good time with the movie. There's all kinds of kung fu choreography and the outfits and hairdos are all sensational. And you have Demi Moore along for a little bit of extra star power. So it's just kind of fun. You'll forget this movie three seconds after it's over, but while you're watching you'll have a perfectly nice time. ARENA: And another sequel, ""Red, White and Blonde,"" is also due out. You're not as hot on this one, are you? STERRITT: No, that for me is the disappointment of the bunch. The original ""Legally Blonde"" was not exactly a great film either. But it did have Reese Witherspoon, and she is so perky. And she's just fun to look at even when the movie around her isn't so great. This time I'm afraid the movie is really far-fetched. I mean, the first one expected you to believe that a total airhead was going to get into Harvard Law school and do very well there. This one's even more far-fetched. It starts off with her searching out her dog, Bruiser, searching out Bruiser's psychological - excuse me, biological mother. So she can send a wedding invitation. I mean, that's really hard to swallow. I guess if you can get past that, you might enjoy the movie. I found the whole thing just a little bit too trying too hard to be quirky. ARENA: Well, maybe for the younger audience. STERRITT: Oh, teenage girls are going to have the time of their lives. ARENA: You know what, David, we are going to have to leave it there.

Lexus is facing a threat in 2004 because of acceleration problems. What's going on with this company? BOUDETTE: Well, former executives have spoken out and say they kind of lost their way, that they got to this -- the beginning of this decade and the people at the top of the company were really pushing financial performance. They wanted profits to go up and they wanted to become the world's largest automaker. And they achieved that. And I think, along the way, they took their eye off the ball a little bit on the meticulous attention you need to have the kind of quality Toyota became known for. And they cut some corners. It's clear that over the last five, six years, when the U.S. regulators brought up problems with Toyota, Toyota tried to minimize it, keep it -- downplay it and keep the recalls to a minimum. ROBERTS: Jon, so, you got a ""do not buy"" recommendation out on this car. What does Lexus need to do to get back into the ""buy"" category? And will you continue to take a look at this, revisit it? LINKOV: Well, we're going to wait to see what Lexus says, if they come up with a fix. We will likely borrow another vehicle and may actually go out and buy another one to make sure that it's something that's a running fix into the line. And we'll retest the vehicle and put it through the battery test that we do. If it does exhibit, you know, a correction factor, if it does intervene on time and keep the vehicle from sliding out, and, you know, potentially rolling over, then we'll probably give it back to the recommended status. ROBERTS: The last time you issued a ""do not buy"" recommendation was in 2001 in Mitsubishi Montero. Did they fix the problem? LINKOV: That, again, was a problem with -- more mechanical.

More on the severe weather when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CHURCH: CNN is learning more about the weapon capabilities of ISIS, and it comes after our Arwa Damon spent a harrowing day trapped in Mosul. VANIER: On November 4th, CNN correspondent Arwa Damon and cameraman Brice Laine entered Mosul with advanced units. The Iraqi army looking to liberate the city from ISIS. Their convoy was ambushed, and they spent 28 hours under siege. Two months later, they returned in this excerpt from their special report, return to Mosul. Iraqi soldiers unearthed a surprising find. ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We've always wondered how ISIS had so much ammunition in Mosul. And it's obvious when you see the weapons factories they had everywhere. They were making everything from scratch. Mortars, rockets. In one factory, they even had fake Humvees out of wood that they were using as decoys. It almost feels like it should be some sort of crafts workshop. There's a childish feel to everything, but that is also what makes it all the more sinister. ISIS had even begun building its own planes. Planes not designed to land anywhere, but instead to be flying suicide bombs. They found this inside the industrial zone in one of the areas used for manufacturing, along with some manuals. It is fairly crudely put together. But this would take a certain level of expertise, creativity and ingenuity. They've cobbled together all sorts of different parts and even used glue to try to fix some of the wires into place. VANIER: Return to Mosul, a CNN special report with Arwa Damon airs several times this weekend. See it on Saturday at noon in Hong Kong or later at 3 p.m. in London right here on CNN.

And there also are very few areas that are actually densely populated. But there were areas within the possible impact zone where a lot of people lived. So even though the odds worked out this time, what if they hadn't? We'd be having a very different conversation right now. And that is why you have growing calls of condemnation from more advanced Western space agencies, that may have done similar things in terms of uncontrolled re-entry decades ago. Think about NASA's Skylab space station in 1979, that famously littered debris over western Australia. That was an uncontrolled re-entry more than 40 years ago. But since then they try much harder to make sure that these items either stay in orbit, which has contributed to a massive orbiting junkyard of space junk, or they bring them down in areas where they definitely won't pose a danger. And there were no definites in terms of this re-entry. The NASA administrator in the United States, senator Bill Nelson, put out a statement on the NASA website overnight. It reads, ""Space-faring nations must minimize the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations. It is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris."" Certainly did make for quite a social media sensation, though, Robyn. You mentioned how there were those videos, posted from people on the ground in Saudi Arabia; also in Israel and in Jordan. Just a tiny little speck in the sky there. But a lot of people, who were following this rocket's trajectory online, on social media, watching livestreams, even an astronomer in Japan, who took a much more high-quality image of the rocket in its final hours, it showed how interested people were in this. Interested and perhaps a bit unsettled, despite the tiny odds of any real damage. But China, which is planning more launches like this in the future, as they work toward completion of their space station by late 2022, could certainly face more criticism and more calls for responsible action if they don't make adjustments to the design of this Long March 5b rocket, which is basically designed to have this sort of uncontrolled re-entry, which could mean more scenarios like this in the coming months.

How has this been for you to deal with personally? DASCHLE: You know, Judy, it's just politics and life in general has its twists and turns. And you have to be willing to accept them. I have no regrets. I am so grateful for the 26 years that I have had, the opportunity to live out my passions. And I look at this -- this juncture in my life as a newfound opportunity, a new opportunity to do things that I never thought I maybe would do. So I don't -- you know, I've -- life has been good. And life will continue to be good. WOODRUFF: It's been reported that you were called by -- you said you were called by a number of Republican senators to offer their condolences after you lost. But the only one who said you could use his name apparently was Trent Lott. What did the other ones say to you, we're sorry, but don't tell anybody I called? DASCHLE: That's basically it. They called and said that they wanted to express their -- in some cases, even their apologies for the way the campaigns -- or the campaign was run. They indicated they enjoyed working with me and said very, very nice things. But then in virtually every case they said, ""But please don't say to anyone that we've had these conversations because I would rather not be quoted."" So, yes, that was a fairly common comment made by others. WOODRUFF: What did you think about that? DASCHLE: Well, I was very grateful for their kind words and for their friendship and the -- just the nice gesture that it represented. I felt badly that there must be this oppressive feeling on the other side for anyone who showed any kindness towards me. WOODRUFF: What about the partisanship that exists in this town, specifically in the Senate? You made a farewell speech. I gather there were very few if any Republicans even there to hear it. But more broadly, what -- I mean, how partisan is it right now in this... DASCHLE: Well, it's very partisan, clearly. It's unfortunately too partisan in my view. I talked about the need to find the politics of common ground. I still believe that. I feel very strongly that it's -- it's very corrosive, very damaging to the political system to see politics get this vindictive. And I worry about where that will all take us at some point. WOODRUFF: Well, let's be specific. I mean, is this equally shared, Democrats and Republicans? Or are the Republicans mostly -- mostly to blame? DASCHLE: Oh, I'll leave that to others. My feeling is that we often made overtures and expressed a willingness to negotiate and do things in common with our Republican friends. But oftentimes we just couldn't go where",0.5091313046715057,2004-12-20

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) QUEST: Chile's president says he's hoping his country will achieve COVID- 19 herd immunity before the end of June. Sebastian Pinera spoke exclusively to CNN's Julia Chatterley about the fast pace of Chile's vaccine rollout and why it's been so successful. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEBASTIAN PINERA, PRESIDENT, CHILE: Well, the process of our vaccination is -- first of all it's voluntary, and it's absolutely free. We have faced very little opposition. Because we put together a very strong information campaign to convince people that it was necessary, useful, safe and efficient to get vaccinated. But, basically, one of the key aspects that have made our case successful. First of all, that we started to negotiate the position of this vaccine very early; April, May. And at that time we were able to sign contracts or reach agreements that can guarantee us that we will have 36 million doses of the vaccines. And second, because our health, our immunization program, is a very sound and solid one. Chile has always had a very sound health, public health, system. And therefore, we have the vaccines and we have the capacity to distribute vaccines all over the country, to every corner of the country. That's why we're vaccinating -- yesterday, we vaccinated more than 300,000 people in one day. And that's why we are really pushing this process because we want to vaccinate our population as soon as possible. (END VIDEO CLIP) QUEST: The president of Chile.

1140796,1443629,CNN,Talk Asia,"Were you interested in anime or manga? MURAKAMI (through translator): Like many other kids, I liked watching anime. And in the late 1960s and 70s, museums with impressionist works by Renoir and such were gaining popularity. So my parents took me there, and I guess that educated me a bit. I wasn't interested in that art at all, though. It was just through my parents that I was forced to see these exhibitions. I kept on reading and watching them as it was something I was interested in. STOUT: So you were exposed to fine art though your parents as a child. But were you also an Otaku? Were you a little bit geeky? MURAKAMI (through translator): Well, when I was little, I guess I was just an ordinary kid. But then things changed when I was in junior high. You know kids that become geeks become one because of something. Like, they aren't good at sports or girls don't like them. I, too, for some reason, got into things like science fiction and, well, especially science fiction as an escape. STOUT: You went to university at Tokyo National University of Fine Arts. And originally, you wanted to be an animator, but you ultimately studied Nihonga, which is a very traditional style of Japanese painting. Why did that appeal to you? MURAKAMI (through translator): Well, becoming an animator or cartoonist takes a lot of talent, whereas studying Nihonga doesn't require much of it. So I was just thinking in terms of a process of elimination and came down to this occupation. STOUT: You graduated with a Ph.D. in Nihonga, but then afterwards, you abandoned that and took on contemporary art instead. Why? MURAKAMI (through translator): I actually didn't have any particular reason for earning the Ph.D. in Nihonga. What motivated me to become a contemporary artist was the passion I saw in new paintings in the 80s. I also wanted to be an artist that does show performances. So earning my Ph.D. in Nihonga had nothing to do with me becoming a contemporary artist. STOUT: In 1994, you went to New York and you received an artist residency there. What impact did it have on you as an artist and on your work? MURAKAMI (through translator): When I first became a contemporary artist, I knew New York was the capitol of contemporary arts. So I was trying to imagine what New York was like when creating my works. But when I actually arrived in New York, I found myself at the very center of it all. There was a huge gap between what I had imagined and what I actually saw. And I was able to experiment on how I could possibly make those dreams a reality. Although there was a huge difference between working with your mere imagination in Japan, and experimenting with the realities in New York.

We'll also take a few minutes to look back at all that's happened alone the presidential campaign trail this week. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: You see the calendar, next Tuesday's Democratic primary here in the District of Columbia is nonbinding. The result has no effect on delegate votes at the Democratic National Convention. Dennis Kucinich, Carol Moseley Braun and the Reverend Al Sharpton all took part in a radio debate here in Washington this morning. The only other candidate on the D.C. ballot, Howard Dean, skipped the debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REV. AL SHARPTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'd like to ask Governor Dean why you're not here today. I would like to ask him, since you received so many political endorsements in the District, and so much of the political establishment support, don't you think you embarrassed your supporters by not standing up on a day the District needs your help? (END VIDEO CLIP) WOODRUFF: D.C. Congressional delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton was in the audience for this morning's debate and she joins me now. Representative Norton I know that Al Sharpton was talking about Governor Dean. But is it an insult to the District of Columbia that five out of the nine Democrats running for president aren't even competing, aren't even on the ballot here? ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, (D), D.C. DELEGATE: Judy, I haven't endorsed any of them. But I don't think they were trying to insult us. Indeed all of them have been very strong supporters for the District of Columbia. But we're very disappointed that they got off the ballot and did not stay on the ballot, particularly since it was non-binding and since the purpose of our first primary is to get the word out that most Americans don't know. And that is that the Congress keeps us from spending our own money to tell the country that we are taxed without representation. We don't have the same representation everybody else in the world, in Iraq, and everywhere (UNINTELLIGIBLE) just like everybody elses. WOODRUFF: In fact, that appears to be what this primary in the District of Columbia is all about, more so than choosing who the next Democratic nominee for president is. How do you accomplish your mission of getting the message out there about lack of representation? NORTON: We are very excited about the fact that there is increasing attention on our primary because it's the first time that anybody will know how people really feel other than through polls. And as they focus on the district we're making sure that they understand that the purpose of our primary is to get the word out that we do not have full voting rights and yet we pay our taxes like everybody else. So it has a dual purpose. And for us in the District the most important purpose is to take this suppressed message, this message that",0.052084792471277,2004-01-09

CURNOW: Well, it's quite amazing, I suppose, under those circumstances how the human spirit always triumph. And initially this accident was triggered by a pipe falling, which then triggered an electrical cut. So the entire mine went into pitch darkness. Now with 3,200 people all together in the dark, many of them said they felt like they were upside down. They just absolutely lost sense of their bearings. It was such a disorientating experience. But they got themselves together and what has been quite remarkable is that they got themselves organized into groups of 25. So they were manageable. They were small groups. And they've been keeping each other basically supported in these small groups. And these small groups that are systematically being brought up to the surface over the past few hours. ROBERTS: Just an incredible experience for those people, but it looks like all of them are going to be brought up safely. Mine officials say that they could have all 3,200 up by later on today.

Also a rare and poignant moment today, all eight other justices not wearing their robes standing together saying good-bye to their friend and their colleague. CNN justice correspondent, Pamela Brown, is outside the court where thousands of people have been streaming in and out to say farewell. Pamela, obviously a very moving event today, Justice Scalia having obviously touched a lot of lives. Maybe some of our viewers don't know his bestfriend on the court was liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. PAMELA BROWN, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Jake. They were best buddies on the bench. Scalia called them the odd couple because they had such different ideologies, looked at the law so differently, but they rode elephants together, they went parasailing together and they were best of friends. What was interesting here today was that people showed up to pay their respects like the ones behind me in line and not all of them share Scalia's conservative ideology, but they said they wanted to come here and pay their respects because Scalia was such an influential judge. He really changed the way people looked at the law and he dedicated 30 years of his life to service. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BROWN (voice-over): On this somber afternoon at the high court, President Obama and the first lady arrived to pay their respects to Justice Antonin Scalia. The first couple paused at the flag-draped casket as Scalia's former clerks stood guard. They'll be taking turns through the day and night. One of his clerks, Jamison Jones. JAMISON JAMES, FORMER SCALIA CLERK: It was a really touching ceremony this morning. Justice Scalia was a brilliant mentor, but also a warm and kind and generous person. BROWN: This morning, Supreme Court police officers carried the conservative icon on his final journey to the high court. Behind the casket, some of Scalia's favorite law clerks. Dozens more lined the marble steps waiting at the massive bronze doors of the court, Scalia's children, grandchildren and his son, a Catholic priest. Father Paul Scalia led the casket into the great hall where the eight remaining justices said goodbye to their colleague and friend. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My brothers and sisters, Jesus says come to me all you who labor and are burdened and I will give you rest. BROWN: When the private ceremony ended, the public filed in. Two people of particular note, Patty Millette and Sri Srinivasan, considered top contenders to be the president's nominee to replace Scalia. Another striking moment, the actor who portrayed Scalia in the play ""The Originalist"" teared up as he stood at the casket. Outside members of the public braved the cold for their turn.

There, you won the French championship last season with the team. That is amazing. How was that? NADIM: It was great. It was the first time in the club's history that they won the league and that was the reason I signed with PSG. I wanted to win the league with them, probably one of the biggest achievements. ANDERSON: Look, it's been quite the summer for you, winning the French championship with PSG; only weeks later, the Taliban taking over power in Kabul. ANDERSON: What's been running through your mind when you see these images coming out of Afghanistan now? NADIM: At the beginning I wasn't really understanding what was happening. It sounded like a deja vu. And I never really thought that it would come back to this. It feels like history repeating itself. So that way, it was confusing. I couldn't understand it. And it was upsetting to see how they're gaining more power. And now that they're actually running the country, yes, it makes me upset, makes me angry. I don't think they deserve it. I don't think that terrorist groups should have that much power. ANDERSON: They have just announced the formation of a government, which is not at all inclusive. It has no women representation. In fact, the Taliban said women in Afghanistan will be banned from playing any kind of sport. It, quote, ""exposes their bodies."" You must be concerned about the future for Afghanistan's sporting teams, aren't you? NADIM: If you're not allowed to play music or listen to music, how do you think sports is going to be in the conversation? It's just cave men trying to control people by fear. I don't see any sports in the future in Afghanistan. ANDERSON: How does that make you feel? NADIM: Like upset. It upsets me, you know.

So what did Cheney do differently to stay alive while few others in his position have survived? A heart transplant is not an everyday occurrence. GUPTA: Yes. I think there's a couple things. And we talked about this a little bit as well. In some ways, he was the beneficiary of many medical developments at the exact time he needed them. So perfections of a particular technique in heart surgery, certain devices that were made available to him, things like that that just came along right when he needed it. He gave this analogy: When he drives down the road, it's like every light looks red, but as he's pulling up to them, they start to turn green. That's how he saw this intersection between his medical history and medical technology, helping him. But he also did something else, Wolf, I think is very important. He really was very diligent, he says, about getting checked out. 37 years old, he has this tingling in his arms and hands and he goes to the doctor and gets it checked it out. Turns out it was the beginning of a heart attack. A lot of 37-year-olds probably might blow that off or not go to a doctor right away. He said if he was in the middle of a televised vice presidential debate and started to have symptoms, he would have left the lectern and gone to the hospital.

Also happening this hour, Vice President Mike Pence meeting with leaders of the cruise line industry in Florida. The travel industry has been especially hard-hit as the coronavirus spreads. Let's begin right now in New York, which has just been put under a state of emergency due to the coronavirus. I'm joined now by Governor Andrew Cuomo. Governor, good to see you. You had already said before today that this is like a flu on steroids. But what does this now declaration of state of emergency mean for your state? GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Good afternoon, Fred. The state of emergency gives us additional flexibility to do things faster, purchasing, hiring of staff, et cetera. And for us, the challenge is what the challenge is for every state -- test as many people as you can. Once you find a person who has tested positive, run down that chain, test as many as you can as quickly as you can just to get them into a place where they no longer infect other people. And that's what we're doing. At the same time, Fred, it's important that we don't feed this undue hysteria and fear that is out there, right? If you're infected with the coronavirus, 80 percent self-resolve, 20 percent could get ill, and the vulnerable populations are senior citizens, people who have immune systems that are compromised, or underlying illnesses. So we have to keep that basic reality in check. WHITFIELD: Well, this fear, and hysteria among some people is really because they don't feel like they know enough, and maybe they're a little confused about if they need to be tested, if there are enough tests, et cetera. There were 21 new coronavirus cases in your state alone today, bringing the total to 76 statewide. That in and of itself is enough to alarm many. So how do you allay the fears? CUOMO: Yes, I think facts allay the fear here, right? If you understand the facts, you would be calm. If you understand the bottom line, what happens if I get the coronavirus, OK? If I get the coronavirus, 80 percent of the people who get the coronavirus will self-resolve, 20 percent will be ill and maybe hospitalized. The mortality is primarily among senior citizens, immune-compromised, and people with underlying illnesses. That is the bottom line. Well, then why all this running and testing, et cetera? Because we want as few people infected as possible. But I think in some ways the anxiety is outpacing the reality of this situation.

Outside the camp, we get access to a prison. A surreal scene. Former ISIS fighters painting and crafting papier-mache models. This man says ISIS held his family hostage to coerce him to join. ISIS gave me the bombs, he tells us, and then showed me on WhatsApp how to plant them. He's serving 20 years, the maximum sentence. In the crowded cell, some men say they never supported ISIS.

His first mission, to plant explosives at a U.S. base. He describes how they were given the bombs, weapons, and suicide vests. We covered everything with the women's black veil, he says, so the jets in the sky would not target us. The operation failed and he ended up in prison. But even there, ISIS ruled, he says.

(END VIDEO CLIP) MORET: That`s Viviane Acarie, Jorgete Acarie`s sister. Jorgete was shot multiple times with her two-year-old son nearby. Police have arrested her boyfriend, Kristofer Gould, but on unrelated charges. Let`s go out to Holly Hughes, criminal defense attorney, former prosecutor in Atlanta. I can`t stress enough he`s not yet named a suspect, nor is he arrested for this case, but he is in custody. Holly, what do you do if this is your client? HOLLY HUGHES, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, you know, if this is my client -- I wouldn`t have taken him quite frankly, Jim, because of the history, because of the pattern. And I have to jump in here because I feel so bad for this family. The breakdown in the system was not with the police officers. They went and arrested him. She went and took the injunction. She did everything right. The problem, Jim, is we have the laws on the books, but the judges are not sentencing. He was on probation for aggravated stalking -- why wasn`t he doing ten or 20 years in the prison system? That is what would have saved her life is if the judge had sentenced appropriately. You know, the police officers can only do so much. They arrest him, take him to jail. There was a probation warrant that was issued for him saying, yes, he messed up again. We revoke his probation. He was on GPS. How did they not know where he was? So, you know, at this point -- MORET: And Holly, one thing -- (CROSSTALK) HUGHES: -- in time -- MORET: -- one thing that`s so frustrating -- one thing that`s so frustrating, I`m watching this and thinking to myself, wait a minute, if this is my sister, if this is my friend, and I say you do everything you can, she did everything she could. She called 911 55 times. HUGHES: She did. Absolutely did. MORET: She got a restraining order. HUGHES: Right. MORET: What are you supposed to do? HUGHES: Right. That`s the problem. That`s what I`m saying. The breakdown here was at the sentencing level, Jim. Somebody, some judge should have sentenced him to ten or 20 years and then this woman would have been safe because to be perfectly frank, and it`s a frightening thought, but if a stalker wants to get you, they`re going to get you because nobody`s looking over their shoulder. Nobody`s locking them up. They`re letting them out on probation with an ankle monitor. That`s nice, but guess what, he breaks into their house and shoots you it takes five minutes by the time the ankle monitoring company is notified, you`re dead.

We had -- you know interesting sightings from, you know, Beyonce running into a drugstore, to Queen Latifah stopping by Macy's for some last-minute shopping. Everyone is here, though.

I just want to lay out, so people are clear about a few things, and then explain to me again why it's different. Serena Williams' coach admitted that he was coaching. He did admit after the fact that he was coaching. That is a violation. It isn't called, usually, but it does happen. The racket. Breaking the racket. That is a clear violation, which is always given a warning. And then the third thing, calling the ump a thief. Those were the three infractions there. What is different in this case? Again, you told us you've seen men do worse. JENKINS: Correct. BERMAN: But what exactly could or should the ump have done? JENKINS: So the chair umpire has incredible latitude and discretion. Most chair umpires issue a warning. So coaching is almost never called. I think in the entire U.S. Open tournament this year, maybe it was called three times. With -- with -- you know, it's a -- it's a real minor infraction. It's something that her coach did, not the player. It clearly didn't affect the play on the court. And so most chair umpires would issue a warning and say your coach is trying to signal you, that needs to stop. Instead, he assessed her a code violation. In the second instance, she broke her racket. He had to do something, no question about it. It's pretty cut and dry there. The problem is that he had already assessed her the first code violation for really a terribly minor infraction. So now he's got her on the edge of the precipice. A third violation is a mandatory deduction of an entire game. She's standing on the edge of the cliff there. All she says to him is, you stole a point from me, you know, and basically he pushes her off the cliff. It was a terrible abuse of his discretion and his authority in the U.S. Open final. Nobody's ever seen anything like it really. It was unprecedented, at least in my experience. It was unprecedented in Billie Jean King's experience, in Chris Everett's experience, all the most veteran announcers and players who watched this match thought it was absolutely incredible. CAMEROTA: And, Sally, it was so unfortunate. JENKINS: And, by the way -- CAMEROTA: Yes. JENKINS: A number of male players have come to her defense. BERMAN: Djokovic, after he won yesterday, said it should never have gone that far. The winner of the men's U.S. Open too. I mean -- CAMEROTA: Yes. I mean and one of the heartbreaking things about it is that for Naomi Osaka, who end -- she was playing really well. OK, Naomi Osaka was playing really well.

Maybe wrong, but consistent in saying I think this has been a muzzled, one of my favorite words, a muzzled campaign. In other words, I think both candidates have been scared to death that, if they play some rough politics here, they get branded a racist or a sexist. You can`t control the 527s. You know, if someone undertakes a swift- boating-like effort come the fall, John McCain will get blamed for it, even though he`s got nothing to do with it. I think the fall is going to be a whole new set of rules. RIDLEY: I would agree. If I can just jump in. I mean, look, one thing, you`ve seen that people are really tired of this negatives. I think two things. The Democrats have learned from the swift-boats and from the Willie Hortons and from things like that, they`ve got to step up. But you`ve seen Barack Obama be able to weather these kinds of things. You talk about things sounding racist or whatever. What`s good for the goose is good for the gander. The Republicans could come off sounding the same exact way. And the Clinton supporters. She has got to go out there and maintain the supporters. If she doesn`t get the nomination, she`s going to be running for Senate again. She`s going to need Barack Obama to help her get back in New York. SMERCONISH: And let me just piggyback on that, if I may. One thing we`ve learned about Senator Obama, I think, in this primary season: the man can counterpunch. When he has come under attack, it`s been within 24 hours he`s had something to say. You know, John Kerry made -- made, I thought, a terrible mistake in allowing himself to be the subject of all that took place in the swift-boat controversy without responding. It`s not going to happen to Obama. ALLEN: What Senator Obama does so well is to react to these things with a smile, a laugh and a cutting comment. A good example of that was calling Senator Clinton ""Annie Oakley"" the other day after -- after some of the discussions. SMERCONISH: I agree with you. Jonathan, I agree. Good stuff. ALLEN: Bill Clinton did that, too. SMERCONISH: Appreciate you both being here. It`s -- it`s all good stuff. Tuesday we`ll find out. Have a good weekend. ALLEN: Thank you. Thank you.

LIEBERMANN: You'd be forgiven for thinking the candidates were running for office in Israel. GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: By supporting the Israelis. LIEBERMANN: The Republicans trying to one-up each other, arguing about who keep Israel safe and who can repair the strain relations between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Trump has gotten most of the headlines in Israel. TRUMP: My name is Donald Trump and I'm a big fan of Israel. LIEBERMANN: Playing up his stance on Israel and highlighting an ad he made for Netanyahu's re-election in 2013. And yet his comments on registering Muslims in the U.S. and a salute to Trump at an Orlando rally compared by some to an apparent Nazi salute, that all frightens some Israelis. ALON PINKAS, POLITICAL ANALYST: Like the entire world and Israelis are looking astounded and astonished at this phenomenon called Donald Trump. LIEBERMANN: Yet, despite the Republican emphasis on Israel, the latest poll from the Israel based Panels Politics Institution shows Israelis favor Clinton. A carry-over from Israelis' fondness for Bill Clinton. (on camera): We hear Trump and Cruz and before, Rubio, and now, Kasich, arguing about who is the most pro-Israel, and yet Israelis prefer Hillary Clinton. Why is that? PINKAS: I think it's a recognition and familiarity thing. She's a household name in this country. I think everyone remembers her husband, Bill Clinton, when he was president.

But when we reached out to the prosecutors' office, they deny that Mubarak had even been questioned by authorities. We will stay on this one and get you an update as soon as we can. Also, it appears an American man has been arrested in North Korea. We're not heavy on the details, but Swedish diplomats do tell CNN that their embassy in Pyongyang is helping negotiate this man's release. We don't know his name. We don't know where he's from, and we still don't know why he was in North Korea. And a woman in France received a fine for wearing a piece of religious clothing that covers her face. The fine, 150 euros, it's roughly $200, for violating the so-called burqa ban that went into effect just yesterday. The new law in France makes it illegal for anyone to conceal their face in public. But Muslims in France see it as a specific attack on their faith. This is a protest you're looking at here. This is Paris just yesterday. Police took away two veiled women they say for demonstrating illegally, not for covering their faces. French officials say they banned burqas for security reasons and to preserve French values of equality and identity.

Is it, you know, tax reform, you know, reforming ObamaCare? I mean, there are a lot of things that really mean a lot to American people. And you really haven't gotten a sense on either candidate yet. What they're going to bring comes November. BURNETT: So, there's Donald Trump wins, markets tank, fear mongering or something to it? COSTA: Well, if markets tank after Donald Trump wins, I think it is fear mongering, but I don't see that happening. BURNETT: You don't see it happening? COSTA: No. I don't see that happening. I think that either candidate is, they will be some sort of upheaval short term after the election irregardless of who wins. And markets will stabilize and the economy is what matters. Earnings matter. You know, growth prospects, so on and so forth, the same story going that's been on for 150 years will continue in November.

And that would mean that despite the amount of testing with these known false negative rates that you would still choose to protect the most important people in our government by the social distancing behaviors, if necessary. And not just that, but as the leaders of this crisis, as the incident commander of this crisis, I think the president has a unique opportunity from an optic standpoint to model behavior that his constituents should follow. Because as everybody know, this president has a very unique ability to reach his constituents who model his behavior probably more than any other president in their lifetime.

I mean, no doubt, his presence is very important on this task force but what does that mean to you, a modified quarantine? Is there such a thing that's actually safe? PHILLIPS: Well, first and foremost, I hope they are all okay and I hope that they all remain negative. The daily testing they're going through is not a pleasant experience. I was tested yesterday and can attest to that. From his standpoint, first of all, I trust that he's going to make all the right adjustments, more than just about anybody. I think what he means by a modified quarantine is that when we talk about exposures to this virus, he's looking at it in the same way that we do in a healthcare setting, where he can gauge a low, medium or high encounter based on pretty specific criteria. And his spokesperson has called this a low risk encounter, which is probably just glancing. And in that regard, he feels safe taking appropriate precautions, wearing a masks to go to an empty office. I don't have -- I don't take any issues with that as a medical provider. And, again, most of us medical providers are taking cues from Dr. Fauci. He's the best at this.

Senator Kerry as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has a lot of world stature, he has a lot of relationships with world leaders and in the past he's really done a lot for President Obama. If you remember, he -- when John Kerry was running for president in 2004, he gave then Senator Obama his first kind of shot on the world stage at the Democratic convention. He's also been President Obama's partner in terms of prepping for the debate. And he served in as Mitt Romney, and also Senator Kerry has also done a lot of work for the administration in terms of troubleshooting around the world.

Researchers say test-tube babies now account for about 4 percent of all live births, so back to the napping study, can you nap during the day?

It turns out it might not have been such a good thing. LEMON: I don't know if any of you, guys were on, but I remember saying several times months ago, that why doesn't he just say put out his tax returns and say I know better than anybody else because look at what I was able to do with our tax code and it needs reform. And there's a sound bite somewhere, I have said it, but why didn't you guys ever say that, Betsy? MCCAUGHEY: I'm going to give you credit for that. LEMON: But why, I'm saying it was a perfect story for me, which leads people to believe that maybe there's something else or something bigger that is hiding in his tax returns on what -- what was just uncovered. We'll discuss. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEMON: Oh, boy. The commercial breaks are only broadcast, Donald Trump's charitable foundation getting him into trouble with New York State's Attorney General. Back with me now, Betsy McCaughey, John Avlon, and Jennifer Granholm. So, can I ask you about the respond, Betsy, from the Trump surrogates because I said I never thought that I would see Rudy Giuliani or Chris Christie, or Betsy McCaughey like doing cart wheels and back flips trying to explain this. Would you have used the same language genius? MCCAUGHEY: I would definitely not have said genius and brilliant because it is such a widely used provision in the tax code, there's nothing genius or brilliant about it, but I would say it is an essential part of the tax code and we shouldn't eliminate it because it encourages people to take risks, creating job. (CROSSTALK) LEMON: Moving on. Let's talk about Eric Schneiderman, the New York State Attorney General saying that his -- and telling Trump basically giving his charity a cease and desist, what's your reaction? MCCAUGHEY: Yes, I got it right here. LEMON: What's your reaction? MCCAUGHEY: My reaction is this. For the top law enforcement person in the state to sign on to the Hillary Clinton campaign advisory board and then turn around and launch an investigation of her opponent is unethical. And he should have recused himself. Many people should calling for his resignation because of this conflict of interest. And someone else should be looking into this.

And what people don't realize is there are already laws on the books in Michigan alone that can send you to jail for 30 days if you don't send your child to school. So, what I'm proposing is lot less stringent than some of the parental responsibilities that are on the books in most states. For example, the government tells you, you have must have your child inside for curfew laws. The government tells you, you must have your child in a seatbelt or in a car seat. The government tells you that you have to send your child to school, at least in Michigan, from 6 to 16. So, the government, people are saying, already tells you how to deal with your children anyway. So, this is not any more than what's already required by law. VELSHI: What's the reaction been so far to your proposal? WORTHY: Mixed. A lot of people like it. It's either hot and cold, no gray area. A lot of people like it, or the people who don't talk about the government intrusion and that kind of thing. And I point out to them all the time what I said already. There are laws on the books that are much tougher than this already, and we already have parental responsibility laws on the books as well. VELSHI: Was there something specifically that triggered you to think about this as a solution? WORTHY: Yes, it was. There was a case that happened here some months ago, and we have now convicted the 12-year-old boy -- or 12- year-old adolescent -- 12-year-old person for committing blatant murder in the first degree on someone in the middle of the night at 2:30 in the morning. And when the police went to that child's house, the parents had no idea where that child was. And I'm not saying he sneaked out one day. They had no clue where he had been for days. VELSHI: Right. WORTHY: And he hadn't been in school. He already had a school truancy conviction, or offense, on his record. And there goes that direct link. VELSHI: All right. So you're talking a little bit about responsibility and discipline, and making sure we know where our young people are, in school. And public schools serve that purpose, if they're not fully educating everybody, as some critics would say. They are at least accounting for where these kids are and giving them some sense of being in one place. WORTHY: That's right. When you choose to have children, we ought to take care of them. We ought to be responsible. In other words -- let me also just say one more thing. You're exempt if your child is performing above average in all classes. I'm not talking about you.

VELEZ-MITCHELL: Another huge oops. Investigators admit the case file in that first file, lost. Couldn`t find about it. They didn`t know about it until the girl called in the wake of this whole scandal and said, ""Guess what? He raped me."" Then in 1998 Garrido was paroled after serving just 11 years of a 50- year rape sentence. When he violated parole in California after that, officials in Nevada should have been informed so they could have locked him up again. Never inform. They were never told that there was a parole violation. In 2006, somebody called 911, as you just heard Tom Ruskin say, to report children living in tents and sheds behind Phillip Garrido`s home. Police went to the home, but they did not check the back yard. Authorities went to Garrido`s house, in fact, more than two dozen times without discovering Jaycee and her daughters living in sheds in the back yard. Curtis Sliwa, when you hear that litany, it`s enough to make your head explode. SLIWA: Oh, Jane, but think of it. Three times a month he had to report to the parole officer or the parole officer had to do an on-site visit? What was the parole officer coming over for, a cup of coffee and a cannoli? Didn`t he think, ""Let me look from the back yard. Gee, boy, this looks like something special. What`s that tarpolin? How come you have a subdivision back there?"" My God. Scrape the barnacles off of their backside. And remember, this was an agent who only had 40 cases. So he can`t claim that he was overburdened, because he had only the worst of the worst. And you would think if you`re dealing with the worst of the worst, you`re going to check them for belly button lint under an electron microscope.

Here`s psychology so that -- here`s - - look at the past crimes. And you can try to see what he might do in the future""? Any of that? SACHS: Absolutely. Not only does parole have training on how to be able to search a house day or night, with or without a warrant, but they also have the key red flags to look for when you`re looking at a sex offender. And perhaps the greatest tragedy that`s yet to come from this case that no one`s talked about quite yet is the fact that this weakens the perception of the sex registration for every victim out there.

O'BRIEN: A ferocious war of words raging this morning between the speaker of the House and the vice president. The issue is the war on Iraq and whether it is unpatriotic to disagree with the White House. The spat began in Tokyo. Vice President Dick Cheney blasting the plan pushed by House Democrats to restrict Pentagon funding for the war, to make it harder to send more troops. Cheney said the plan would ""validate the al Qaeda strategy,"" which would prompt the U.S. to throw in the towel in Iraq.

HARLOW: Sanjay, the CDC just said that Americans that live in rural parts of the country are dying at three times the rate of those in urban centers right now from COVID. And we know a group, the CDC, they're going to meet next week and basically start deciding how they're going to distribute this vaccine. What do you know about who decides? Who decides who gets it? Who decides which vaccine they get and, ultimately, who decides who is an essential worker, because that's a really broad classification? GUPTA: Yes, these are really interesting discussions, obviously, against the backdrop of the fact that even if you do the math and say, who are all those various groups of people, right, the frontline health care workers, the elderly, the vulnerable by virtue of preexisting condition. If you start adding them all up, it's a lot of people and represents a lot more people than we have vaccines for. So some of these decisions are going to have to be made. I guess that's the point of your question. There is a committee, the advisory committee for immunizations, ACIP, it's called, they basically look at this data, look at what's possibly available in terms of vaccines and then make those decisions. I can tell you the idea, just going back to the health care system, part of the reason, it's obvious I guess why health care workers are going to be at the front of the line is, because right now, you can't afford to have health care workers en masse start to become infected and not be able to work because that will put even a greater strain on the health care system. Again, that's obviously but that's really the priority right now. After ACIP sort of makes their recommendations, they go to the CDC and say, here is the recommendations and the CDC essentially creates vaccination guidelines for the country. So that's the way it should work. It can take a little while, although everything is being accelerated and some of the meetings are happening concurrent, but that's the typical practice. That's, of course, after the FDA authorizes this. HARLOW: Yes.

And, to me, this week is Trump playing into every argument that 2020 candidates will make against him on the Democratic side in the most perfect way. You have got immaturity, you have got volatility and one that is particularly concerning to me and always has been is the possibility of foreign policy via tweet by someone who is impulsive and who doesn't make great decisions and who often times doesn't have a real tuned moral compass when it comes to dictators. Right? So, this is a real problem. And it's a problem that he and Bolton aren't on the same page and that he's talking about that in public and overseas. And, by the way, the Pelosi stuff is stateside political pugilism. And you can say it's out of bounds in certain ways. Overseas, on Memorial Day weekend, it's just wrong, man. HILL: It is. You can't ignore the timing on it, Mary Katharine. And you are absolutely right. You did bring up, though, John Bolton, and we heard from Kaitlan.

I mean, to me, what it -- and, you know, and everyone kind of runs out their string with Trump. There's no one who works for him who doesn't share the last name who has kind of like extended tenure. I mean, the real -- to me, the real point of this week was to underscore the dynamics of the relationship between Trump and the North Korean dictator. The president has gone so far out on a limb in insisting that his personal relationship is what can untie the Gordian Knot that frustrated so many previous presidents from Clinton on, that he's in a position where he has to make this work. And I think what the North Koreans realize is how much leverage that gives him, because of Trump is -- because of his desire to show that he alone can solve this, is going to bend over backwards, as he demonstrated again this week, to forgive almost anything the North Koreans do. I think there's no question who is the pursuer and who is the pursued at this point in this negotiation.

JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via phone): Right. He was well known, I think, as the king of pork and he really didn't shy away from that because he was certainly a supporter of congressional prerogatives, meaning that he believed the Congress was supposed to control the power of the purse and he used that to try to put in roads and infrastructure for the state of West Virginia. Some of those things were actually very badly need, you must say. You talked about my personal story. He was probably the first United States senator I ever interviewed. I had the privilege of sort of in a strange way following his academic path. I went to Marshall University where he went. I went to American University Law School where he went.

He should get sued, from everything I`m hearing about it. You know, in addition to just the things that have been well publicized, there`s also now allegations that he suppressed evidence, didn`t disclose favorable DNA evidence, and that`s shocking. It`s very rare for a prosecutor to actually get in trouble. So I`m glad that in this case the bar has taken action.

Where did -- what was he thinking? Was it only about politics? GREENBERG: It seems like it. Not talking to the accused is OK, because they can remain silent. Not talking to the accuser, how could you not talk to the person who made these allegations and at least form your own opinion of whether or not they`re believable? BECK: OK. I`m not a guy -- I don`t believe in lawsuits and, you know, hey, mistakes happen, et cetera, et cetera. But I look at these Duke lacrosse kids and I think to myself, cha-ching. Can they go after, for instance, the school? The school -- oh, that was big of them -- invited them back to -- to come back to -- you know, to come back and play and go back to school. I think that`s -- I think that`s a slap in the face. You threw me out when I -- when I was accused of something. Now all of a sudden you ask me to come back? Can they sue the school? GREENBERG: I don`t know that they can school the sue if the school followed the policies and the code of conduct that they lay out in the handbook. But why is the school throwing them out? Aren`t we presumed innocent until proven guilty? BECK: I -- I honestly always thought so. What about the accuser? They say that -- somebody is reporting today she had her child today.

1035420,1329226,CNN,The Situation Room,"up for their biggest battle yet. Super Tuesday, only six days away, when 10 states will hold their primaries and their caucuses, 437 delegates at stake. Mitt Romney heads into it with a much needed campaign boost, winning two primaries last night. But he faces some serious challenges in some of the next -- some of next week's contest. Our national political correspondent Jim Acosta is following all of this for us. What's the very latest? JIM ACOSTA, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, Mitt Romney may have some momentum after those twin victories in Michigan and Arizona. But now, the trick for Romney is to make sure that big mo doesn't turn into another uh-oh. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you like to check the lineup? MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, fire it up. ACOSTA (voice-over): Under the Midwestern microscope, once again, Mitt Romney toured a factory in the critical Super State of Ohio. Where better to get hands on with the equipment? ROMNEY: I've got to press a button, which will be my heavy lift in terms of manufacturing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There it goes. ACOSTA: For Romney, the real heavy lift comes in less than a week, when 10 states are up for grabs on Super Tuesday. But polls show the map could get messy with different states favoring different contenders. Romney's pitch -- listen to the voters who put them over the top in Michigan. ROMNEY: Interestingly, the people who said the economy and jobs were their number one issue, they voted for me overwhelmingly. And that's one of the reasons I'm running. RICK SANTORUM (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're out here today heading to Super Tuesday with some wind at our back and it's going to blow. ACOSTA: Rick Santorum insists the wind is still at his back. He's claiming when all of the delegates are allocated out of Michigan, he'll come out of that contest with a tie. SANTORUM: And here's the really important part: delegates -- because that's what this is all about. And we actually won half the congressional districts, so we're going to walk off Michigan with 15 delegates, and he's going to walk out with 15 delegates. We tie. ACOSTA: But according to CNN's exit polls coming out of Michigan, the former Pennsylvania senator still has challenges. As expected, Romney won among suburban and wealthy voters, but Romney also captured the Catholic vote, a blow to Santorum who shares the same faith. Santorum's strengths were self identified very conservative voters. But he also won union members, even Democrats -- a reminder of the controversial robocall he ran in Michigan that appealed to non- Republicans to cross over and make mischief. But it's Newt Gingrich who may have the most on his mind. The former speaker hinted his campaign could be finished if he doesn't win his home state of Georgia on Super Tuesday.

CHUCK BROWN, LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY: Well, again, that's what we're charged with, us, along with the Corps of Engineers, FEMA and the EPA. We are charged with disposing of it in an environmentally sound manner. Right now we've got several methods to handle woody waste, which is trees and drowned limbs, of which there's a tremendous amount, especially in the New Orleans area. We're going to look at clean burning it for -- to use a layman's term. And that just means we are going to use certain apparatuses to keep the particulate matter and the smoke down. Then we will open burn in strategic areas and ultimately we will look at traditional disposal. O'BRIEN: All right, that's for the woody stuff, as you call it. What about the appliances? What about things that actually could have some kind of environmental hazards kind of built into them? What do you do with those? BROWN: Well, again, you know, I'm glad you brought that up because our goal is to not solve one environmental problem, and, of course, create another. The white goods which you are referring to are stoves, refrigerators, washers and driers, we've estimated that there is about a million pieces. Right now, everyone knows that we're charged with recycling every one of them. And that means that we will evacuate the Freon and oil from the refrigerators. And if they can be reused, we will be finding sources throughout the country to actually take them and recycle them. So, again, we don't plan on burying not one appliance. Not one. O'BRIEN: Well, how is it going to work logistically? I mean in the streets of New Orleans right now, the debris is just piled up on the streets. Are waste management trucks going to start rolling through? Do people have to bring their stuff to a landfill in their own vehicles or the vehicles, I guess, that they're renting, if they've lost their vehicles? How does it work? BROWN: Well, at this point, again, we've -- we're identifying staging areas. As a matter of fact, I'm going back down to New Orleans today to look at some other areas where we will actually bring all the debris to, to separate it out. And that includes household hazardous waste, which is, you know, the every day material that you have under your kitchen sink. But we've got areas identified. When the citizens do start to return, we will ask them, through public service announcements, to bring their household hazardous waste to the curbsides. We're going to -- even electronic waste, computers. We want to separate everything out. We want to try to reuse everything. But at this point we have major contractors ready to hit the ground running as soon as we give them the word to say let's go right now.

Coming up, the Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius speaking out about controversial rules preventing a young girl from getting the transplant she needs to stay alive. Plus, home invasion robbers caught on tape. But they weren't counting on a 10-year-old boy whose quick thinking foiled their plan. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: The secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told lawmakers on Capitol Hill today she's asked for a review of the process that could potentially keep a 10-year-old girl in Philadelphia from getting a new pair of lungs she so desperately needs but the child's parents want much more than that, and now they're responding. Our national correspondent Jason Carroll has been working the story for us. He's joining us now with details. What's the latest, Jason? JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Sebelius was really in the hot seat today, Wolf. She was supposed to be attending a hearing focus on the budget but Sebelius faced some very tough questions about whether department guidelines are standing in the way of this little girl getting the medical care that she needs. Sarah Murnaghan's parents say their daughter, if she does not get a lung transplant, she will -- she will die. She is suffering from cystic fibrosis. They say it could be a matter of weeks or months for her. Right now she is on a wait list for children but not on the wait list for adults. Her parents are asking that guidelines be changed so that Sarah -- and for that matter, all children, Wolf, who are in a critical situation, can then be moved to an adult list. Sebelius pressed on the issue earlier this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: First as a mother and a grandmother, I can't imagine anything more agonizing than what the Murnaghans are going through. I talked to Janet Murnaghan, mother of Sarah, about this case. What I've also done is looked very carefully at the history of the rules around lung transplant and organ transplant -- REP.

SEBELIUS: Unfortunately there are about 40 very seriously ill Pennsylvanians over the age of 12 also waiting for a lung transplant and three other children in the Philadelphia hospital at the same acuity rate as Sarah waiting for a lung transplant.

Bill Tucker has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL TUCKER, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The most challenging question isn't on the blackboard. JIM SIMONS, PRESIDENT, MATH FOR AMERICA: I can't find Americans. That is, the majority of the people that I've hired in the last seven or eight years, high-quality research people, are not U.S. people. They're not born in America, and they weren't educated in America. TUCKER: Simons has been called the world's most successful hedge fund manager. He started Math for America last year to encourage math teachers. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The total integrand has to be continued. TUCKER: He calls what's happening with math a crisis. Between 1995, and 2002, the number of American-born college students pursuing graduate degrees in science and engineering fell, while at the same time foreign grad students at U.S. colleges rose by 50 percent. More teachers with the knowledge and a passion for the subject are key to exciting students.

When the pirates got within a couple of hundred yards of the ship and tried to board it with weapons, they were warned away and then finally the security team opened fire on them with their small arms. What may be most interesting is this attack happened about 350 miles off the coast of Somalia. And that's a fair distance for these pirates to travel, obviously, these large cargo ships try to stay as far off the coast as possible. But now monsoon season is over in that part of the world, the seas are calm again and the pirates are back at it -- Heidi. COLLINS: Yes. So basically it seems like since this last happened and at least it got a lot of attention because we know we've been talking for a long time about this body of water and this type of pirating that's been going on for quite some time, seems like nothing has changed by way of patrolling this humongous chunk of water if you will. STARR: Yes. I mean it's still very tough for anybody, any of the military navies out there to really patrol such a wide body of water. But what they have been doing that is working in many cases, and we saw it now with the Maersk Alabama, is encouraging cargo shippers to put security teams on board, to take measures to defend their ships, to try and do whatever they can in terms of physical security or barriers on their ships, to keep pirates from boarding. If this kind of work... COLLINS: You're talking about them being armed. STARR: Well, part of it is being armed but another thing that was used on the Maersk earlier today, they had loud noise making devices on board which apparently we are told they use to try and ward the pirates off. Many of the ships are doing simple things like not letting their ladders drag in the water so there's no means of -- for the pirates to get on board, putting some kind of physical barriers on the sides of the ships so the pirates simply, physically cannot climb up along side. All of these measures are working in some cases. COLLINS: Yes. STARR: Not all the time. There have been additional hijackings of course. COLLINS: Yes. I've been reading it It's the worst that it's been there. So we will continue to follow it of course. CNN's Barbara Starr, our Pentagon correspondent. Thank you, Barbara.

Our government has no greater responsibility than getting this work done. And there really is no excuse for letting this critical legislation expire. I urge congressional leaders to let the will of the House and the American people prevail and vote on the Senate bill before adjourning for their recess. Failure to act would harm our ability to monitor new terrorist activities and could re-open dangerous gaps in our intelligence. Failure to act would also make the private sector less willing to help us protect the country, and this is unacceptable. The House should not leave Washington without passing the Senate bill. Now I am scheduled to leave tomorrow for a long-planned trip to five African nations. Moments ago my staff informed the House leadership that I am prepared to delay my departure and stay in Washington with them, if it will help them complete their work on this critical bill. The lives of countless Americans depend on our ability to monitor terrorist communications. Our intelligence professionals are working day and night to keep us safe, and they're waiting to see whether Congress will give them the tools they need to succeed or they'll tie their hands by failing to act. The American people are watching this debate, as well. They expect Congress to meet its responsibilities before they leave town on a recess. I'll answer a few questions. Ben, have you got a question? I'd be prepared to answer it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Mr. President. It appears, with that deadline approaching, that the House and the White House might be seen as many engaged in the game of chicken here, playing politics with an important intelligence law. BUSH: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If the law expires and something happens, wouldn't you be at least partly to blame? And on your Africa trip, if you have to delay, do you think that you would be shortening your trip at all? BUSH: As to the latter, you know, the delay depends on whether the House acts, of course. And they've got plenty of time to get this done. But if we have to delay, we'll delay. But I will go to the countries that I've said I'd go to. And to the first case, you know, whether or not this is politics, I certainly hope not. I can assure you, al Qaeda in their planning isn't thinking about politics; they're thinking about hurting the American people again. We -- you know, who's to blame? Look, these folks in Congress passed a good bill last -- late last summer.

And therefore, in our strikes, in many of our strikes we find some leader or the other, second stringer, third stringer, has been eliminated or killed. So we haven't gone for a particular name as such. So all that I would like to say is that the concentration is not on one individual, frankly. We are operating against all terrorists. He could be anywhere, and he will be knocked out if he is in one of the areas where we strike. BLITZER: A lot of people believe he is somewhere along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, probably on the Pakistani side. Is that your assessment? I know you don't know for sure. Is that your working assumption? MUSHARRAF: No. No, it is not, because anyone who says probably he is in Pakistan, I would like to ask him what have you based this judgment on? So therefore I wouldn't be able to say that. He could be on Pakistan side, he could be on the Afghan side. But all that I would like to say is, on the Pakistan side our army is inside all this tribal area belt of ours (ph). There are seven agencies, in all of them we are there. And we are operating there. Is that the case on the Afghan side? Is all the border region, is the military operating in all the regions of the border? No, sir, they are not. So I leave it to anybody's judgment, where would he feel safer? BLITZER: So are you suggesting the U.S. on the Afghan side, together with the Afghan military, the other allied forces on the Afghan side are not doing enough to find bin Laden? MUSHARRAF: No, no. They are doing enough. They are doing a lot. There are certain force restrictions, also the terrain is very inhospitable, and it's a large area. Now, are the troops enough to be in every area? No, they are not enough to be in every area, to cover all the mountains of the region on the border. They are not enough for that. So therefore they are operating according to their own strategy, which they are doing very well. BLITZER: You saw that recent videotape that came out about a month or so ago by bin Laden. He was wearing these gold robes, no weapon around him. You heard what he said. Have you studied that video tape carefully to see if there are any clues where he might be? MUSHARRAF: No, frankly, I didn't. Once we had studied in the past, and we thought the area would be more in the northern portions of the tribal belt. But more than that, one couldn't identify really, no. BLITZER: There are some experts who seem to think he could be in Iran. Do you have any evidence to believe that's possible?

Let's go straight now to Baghdad for details and NEWSROOM's Kyra Phillips. Kyra, what are you hearing? KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR: Well, Brianna, that's basically the information that we have, according to Mosul police. And we just got off the phone with them just a few minutes ago. Those gunmen kidnapped Chaldean Catholic archbishop Faraj Rahho just after they shot dead three of his guards in the al-Nour neighborhood. That's in northern Mosul outside of Baghdad. It happened about 5:45 local time. Apparently, Rahho was getting into his car after he left the al- Safina (ph) church in that neighborhood. The gunman then attacked his car, kidnapped him, and killed the three guards. Now, this happened back in 2005 to his predecessor, as well. He was kidnapped, returned within a day. I also want to make clear that this is not the cardinal that we profiled a few months ago. This was not Emmanuel Karim Delly (ph). This is one of his archbishops who has been kidnapped. And you may be wondering what the Chaldean Catholic Church is here in the Middle East. It's actually connected to the Vatican there in Rome. But it's a Middle-Eastern style of the Catholic Church. And it's very common that this happens in these areas, attacks on the church in Mosul, but in particular these kidnappings, because of course, they're going for the ransom money.

I also think the federal government further complicates it. WHITFIELD: What are your constituents telling or asking of you? What clarity are they looking for from you, the governor of New York? CUOMO: Well, they're saying I don't know what to believe. The CDC says this, but this one says this. The bottom-line question is, what happens if I get the coronavirus, or my spouse or my child gets the coronavirus? And that's why the fundamental fact is most important, right? If you look at the number of cases we have in New York, we have 76 cases, we only have a handful who are hospitalized. If you look at Johns Hopkins, that has been tracing all of the coronavirus cases, 100,000 cases, you see that the overwhelming majority stayed at home, they had symptom, they're feeling better. And now actually more are recovering than are getting the new infection. So the ultimate reality we can deal with. It's this current hysteria and confusion. Frankly the CDC, I don't think, has been helpful here, because they have sent mixed messages. They say on one hand, anybody who needs a test, call your doctor and get a test. The vice president then goes on TV and says, oh, by the way, we can't test enough people. That kind of confusion, or the sense that your government is not competent, that is what is not helpful here. WHITFIELD: So a lot of folks are concerned. I can't help but be concerned about my 87-year-old mother who likes to go to the senior center, who likes to socialize with other seniors, who likes the exercise classes, but is pulling back from doing that right now. And then we are also hearing that a number of people in Washington state were at an elderly facility where they had seen a spike and a large number of deaths. In Westchester County there in New York, you've got, what, 57 cases, in that county. Are you finding any common thread, what the source is, why such a concentration in Westchester County? CUOMO: Westchester County is a cluster scenario, where you had people who attended large gatherings together, and it spread from those gatherings, a Bar mitzvah that had 400 people in it. So that is a unique case, and we're dealing with it. But your point is right, Fred. Personally, what have I done? I've spoken to my mother, who is elderly. Don't tell her I said that, she doesn't consider herself elderly. She doesn't act elderly. WHITFIELD: Seasoned. I like the word ""seasoned."" CUOMO: Seasoned.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BOB BEARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Standard Oil predicted its 1911 breakup would spell doom for investors. But one year later, the resulting companies' combined share prices had jumped 47 percent, according to one study, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained only 7.6 percent. Less than six years later, the total stock value had nearly quadrupled. AT&T;'s 1984 breakup catapulted the telecommunications industry into a new era of competition and innovation. TIM MAHONEY, MERRILL LYNCH: Prior to the breakup, it was a regulated monopoly, and AT&T; was restricted in the types of activity they could engage in. After the breakup, AT&T; was able to engage in a wide range of activities. BEARD: Shareholders received a stake in each new activity. If you held onto your pre-breakup AT&T; stock, you ultimately owned AT&T; plus the seven baby Bells, Lucent, NCR, MediaOne, and Vodafone. Estimates vary on what your portfolio would be worth today. But Merrill Lynch's AT&T; First Exchange series, a fund that's held all the pieces since the breakup, has posted an average annual return of more than 19 percent. That compares to about 18 percent for the Standard and Poor's 500 index. But some analysts say you cannot look at AT&T;'s past to gauge Microsoft's future.

1055444,1350674,CNN,News Stream,"KRISTIE LU STOUT, HOST: Live from Hong Kong, I'm Kristie Lu Stout. Breaking news just coming in from the United Kingdom, news of evacuations taking place right now in central London, a very fluid situation. We have our Nic Robertson live to tell us more on what's happening -- Nic. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kristie, I'm at the police line which is cordoning off one of the main shopping thoroughfares in the center of London, Tottenham Court Road. A young police officer here is telling -- describing to members of the public here that there is a major incident under way here. What I can see from where I am are about two city blocks cordoned off by the tape, parked along the streets are three, four large ambulance vehicles. One of them seems to be a sort of central response unit. It has a satellite on the top that is being tuned in as we speak right now. There are several large London red buses parked at the side of the road, as there are before the police cordon here. All the traffic on the street has been brought to a standstill. The buses parked at random across the road. They're now emptied -- the area, the two-city-block-wide area, now emptied of people. I can see several ambulance workers standing there and a number of police vehicles -- one, two three -- at least half a dozen police vehicles from where I'm standing and various other emergency response security personnel in the street further up from where we are. But the public is being kept back at a distance from whatever is at the center of this police operation. But there are very few details about this now. The situation began perhaps in the last 15 or 20 minutes or so, and it's brought the traffic in this part of -- in this part of London to a grinding halt -- Kristie. LU STOUT: You're saying two blocks have been cordoned off in central London, transport there at a standstill. You're seeing ambulances, emergency workers there at the scene. Any more information on what is causing this incident and whether or not a terror threat is involved? ROBERTSON: It's not clear at the moment at all, Kristie. The way the police here at this police cordon across the street are explaining to members of the public, they're saying it's a major incident that's under way. And certainly in terms of the response of medical and security professionals to this area, it does seem to be something that's quite large. This is absolutely not typical for the center of London, to have an area this large cordoned off, but it does remain unclear precisely what has triggered this. It did begin about 20 minutes. This would normally be an absolutely bustling street full of electronics stores. A lot of people come shopping here on Tottenham Court Road.

BALDWIN: So, that's her side of the story, but because of this story that's come out, there's this crazy uptick in reaction today from NASCAR and beyond. What are you hearing? KEILAR: Yes, I think that her office, in particular, is kind of surprised by how much reaction they got. They told me they had several dozen e-mails, phone calls from people not really her constituents, but really NASCAR fans, many of whom were upset about her effort. They say they also got some contacts who are supporting what she did. They even received a threatening fax from someone that they had to send on to Capitol Police, Brooke. But they're getting reaction today from a driver, Ryan Newman, who is sponsored by the army. In fact he tweeted a couple -- a few different tweets. I know you were following them. One of the things that he said was directing people to tell your Congress person that you support the U.S. army's involved in motorsports, and then that link will actually take people who follow him on Twitter, and there are so many of them, to basically just send an e-mail to their member of Congress. He also said to another tweet that the amendment is not cutting the money from the budget. It's just preventing them from using it on NASCAR, which is true. It doesn't actually cut the money. It just says how they can't use it. BALDWIN: So bottom line, another big argument I guess on behalf of the army these are moving billboards, army cars, marine cars, that really helps recruitment? KEILAR: They're billboards that travel at almost 200 hundred miles per hour at times. The NASCAR crowd is typically a very patriotic bunch, and for all of the corporations, nonprofits, even political candidates -- I know we have covered that story -- this is a chance for them for hours at a time to have a captive audience. They'll tell you it's a really good tool. We actually got a written statement from Ryan Newman to CNN a short time ago, which he said being prohibited from advertising in NASCAR, which is the second largest sporting venue in the nation behind only the NFL, would severely limit the army's ability to reach its recruiting goals, maintain public support, and build for the future. But I think the point is the Congresswoman McCallum is trying to make, either way, she feels like this doesn't really pay off and it's not an effective investment. BALDWIN: Well, I will let you hand me a pit passes or the hookup you have, we will go, Ms. Keilar. you can school me on some NASCAR. Thank you so much, Brianna.

So it's not likely that actually would apply, but you would be influencing elections simply by trying to extend the Mueller clock all the way to November if Trump himself is not on the ballot. But it's a combined strategy. I think ultimately, this is a game where Donald Trump knows that the end result here is a political process, and he cannot run the clock out on the court of public opinion because it does not have deadlines. COOPER: Professor Dershowitz, I mean at what point would Mueller's team subpoena the President to appear before a grand jury if the negotiations fail and they chose to do that? DERSHOWITZ: Well, that's going to be a hard decision on his part because if he does subpoena the President, then that means he's going have to delay writing the report. If he instead says look, I tried to get the President to testify. He won't do it. He won't sit down. he's made every excuse, I've given him every opportunity to prove his innocence, now I'm going to write a report that says the President wouldn't sit down with me, even though I offered him A, B, C, D, written questions, no questions about this, no questions about that. And he uses that in his report as one building block toward a conclusion of some kind of guilt. In the end, if you ask me to bet widows and offerings' money on the outcome, I would have to bet that in the end, Donald Trump does not sit down with the special counsel or testify. In the end, I think we will not hear or see him, unless they go to court and he is compelled to do it by court. But I don't think it's going to happen voluntarily in tend. COOPER: Laura, would you make that bet as well? COATES: You know, I would make the bet that he would prolong and delay his ability to speak. But I think it's really against his interests to try to delay for many of the reasons Alan talked about. It's almost a forgone conclusion that the President will ultimately, if they are subpoena, even after a lengthy litigation battle will find the court saying, yes you are the head of the executive branch of government, which oversees the Department of Justice. If everyone can thumb their noses at a subpoena, then we would have really no justice system, including if the head of the executive branch does that. So, I think they will come back and says he has to testify. However, I don't understand why he fails to realize that it's in his interest to avoid being compelled to testify in front of a grand jury because then he can't have his lawyers in front of a grand jury.

Giambi met the press yesterday. And to nobody's surprise, didn't even mention the word. Steve Overmeyer with details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEVE OVERMEYER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New York Yankees first baseman Jason Giambi didn't admit to taking steroids Thursday but he did apologize for the distraction he has caused to his fans and teammates. JASON GIAMBI, NEW YORK YANKEES FIRST BASEMAN: I feel like I let down the fans, I feel like I let down the media. I feel I let down the Yankees. I feel I let down my teammates. So I apologize for that. OVERMEYER: The San Francisco Chronicle reported last year Giambi admitted to a grand jury that he used steroids for at least two years, applying undetectable steroid cream and injecting himself with testosterone and human growth hormone. Giambi would not confirm what he testified about about BALCO, the California laboratory at the heart of the federal investigation. GIAMBI: I'm sorry that I can't get into bigger specifics for you guys. And hopefully some day I will. Because of the legal issues that are going on, you know, it would be, you know, a lot easier. OVERMEYER: The Chronicle said several big-name athletes called to testify, including Giambi, Barry Bonds and Olympic sprinter Marion Jones, were told they would not be charged with a crime if they told the truth. Giambi was the only athlete so far to allegedly admit using the steroids. GIAMBI: But the one thing that I will tell you is that when I went in front of the grand jury I told the truth. OVERMEYER: Baseball has been rocked by the steroid scandal. And a new book next week from former Major Leaguer Jose Canseco promises to ""set the pot boiling again,"" according to his publisher. Giambi denied Canseco's allegation that he took steroids with Canseco and record-setting slugger Mark Mcguire when the trio played together with the Oakland A's. GIAMBI: I think it's sad.

(MUSIC PLAYING) WATT: More new information in the killing of a Saudi journalist points to the Saudi government. Three sources tell CNN the mission that ultimately led to the disappearance and death of Jamal Khashoggi was organized by a high-ranking officer in Saudi Arabia's intelligence service. One source says the officer is close to the inner circle of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said investigators are now looking into toxic materials that have been painted over inside the consulate. The search will expand to the Saudi consul general's home on Wednesday. U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo has met with the Saudi king and crown prince in Riyadh and travels to Turkey on Wednesday. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh joins us now from outside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. What is the latest from Istanbul? JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Nick, as you mentioned there, on Monday, investigators did finally get access to this building behind me, the consulate. We know they spent eight hours. They had forensic experts in there. So we're waiting to hear what the outcome of that search out was. This is something that CNN has learned from a Turkish official that Jamal Khashoggi was not only killed butt his body was cut into pieces, in the words of that official. Now on Tuesday we were expecting, we saw the preparations for police to get access to the residence of the consul general, who left the country on Tuesday and headed back to Riyadh. But that did not happen. Expectations is that this would happen today. We're going to have to wait and see. As we know we've had very little information coming from Turkish authorities to what they have been able -- been able to piece together so far. Much of what we're learning is coming through leaks and sources. But officially, on the record, what Turkish officials have said is that they are looking at a group of 50 Saudis that they described as persons of interest in this investigation. They arrived in the country on the day of Khashoggi's disappearance. They were inside the consulate and they left later on that day and that some of them included Saudi officials.

Human rights group Amnesty International has just put out a new report, blasting Qatar for what it calls ""the appalling treatment of migrant workers."" It's specifically looking at this, the Khalifa International Stadium and you are getting an exclusive look inside it now. This is footage CNN shot when we were in Qatar towards the end of last year. Now let me walk you through -- ANDERSON: -- some of Amnesty's allegations, that workers are being tricked with deceptive recruitment practices, squalid living conditions, confiscation of passports, denial of exit visas, late payment of wages and even cases of outright forced labor. Well, a short while ago, I spoke to the head of Qatar's World Cup organizing committee, Hassan Al Thawadi. And he began by giving me his reaction to those accusations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) THAWADI: Becky, what I'm saying is the report that issued by Amnesty, while we acknowledge that performed their investigation during the period of February to May in 2015 and might have found a number of issues there, they came back to us in January 2016 with their findings. During the period of time from when they actually did the investigation to when they got to us, we addressed many issues that were reflected in the report and actually covered them ourselves and addressed them and fixed them. So what we ended up doing was the companies that were mentioned in the report, four out of currently 40 companies on Khalifa Stadium have been dealt with. One has been banned until they rectify their situation and they're actually working currently on rectifying their situation. Two have not been contracted further and they have been banned from future projects. And the fourth one is actually becoming a model in complying with our standards. During the period of time in 2015, they have rectified many of the issues that were raised in the report and have ended up becoming, as I said, a model of compliance within the standards. So what I'm saying is progress is being made on the ground as you move forward step by step. ANDERSON: You can see, though, that more needs to be done. Correct? THAWADI: Becky, nothing's ever enough.

And I have one more here, smart business, this is from Jody Smith (ph) in Paducah, no, just old fashion greed, she says. As the late Peter Finch said on the Movie Network several years ago, someone needs to stand up and say I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore. COSTELLO: I'll do it. I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore. This is my favorite one, Bonnie, it's from Elizabeth (ph). She's from Michigan. She says, the oil companies, they are robbing Americans every single day and they do it all the time. I picture them rubbing their hands together with glee every single time they have a whisper of an excuse to raise prices. Nothing will be done about it, my fellow Americans, the poor will continue to get poorer and the rich, especially the oil people, will continue to get richer. I like your spirit, Elizabeth. And thank you for your comments this morning. We enjoyed them. SCHNEIDER: That's true. I didn't get anything from the other side. COSTELLO: No, nobody said it was the American way. SCHNEIDER: No. COSTELLO: And we love, love those oil companies. SCHNEIDER: No. COSTELLO: No. Is it relief at last for south Florida? Deliveries of water and ice are now picking up, stores are reopening, but millions are still without electricity. We'll go live to Miami's famous Orange Bowl. It's been turned into a makeshift relief supply center. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COSTELLO: You know after you take a look at the beautiful New York skyline this morning, I have to point something out to you. Something strange is happening in the city. There's this weird smell of maple syrup hanging over the city. I'm not kidding. People are calling in to the police department, the fire department, the Coast Guard saying what is that smell? I stepped out of the car this morning and I smelled it myself. It smells like, you know, syrup you put on your pancakes in the morning. As far as we know, it's not harmful, but nobody knows where it's coming from. One police officer said, well, it doesn't really smell like maple syrup, it smells more like, you know, hazelnut coffee. It's just the weirdest thing. So we are going to continue to explore that. Nothing serious, but the city of New York smells pretty darn good this morning. Let's talk about Harriet Miers now.

173729,310214,CNN,Live From The Headlines,"PAULA ZAHN, CNN ANCHOR: Attorneys for D.C. area sniper suspect Lee Boyd Malvo are pointing the finger at his co-defendant, John Allan Muhammad. Malvo's attorneys are suggesting Muhammad brainwashed the teen into taking part in last fall's shootings. They want a judge to order the release of any evidence showing their client was under Muhammad's spell. Our own legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin joins us now from Washington. No, indeed. That's what they wrote (UNINTELLIGIBLE), but of course, he's right here in New York City. JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Boy, am I tired. ZAHN: And I can prove that. We're here on the plaza, he's in New York City tonight, folks. All right. So what kind of -- is this nonsense? TOOBIN: It's not nonsense. But it's not a defense either. There's no such thing as under the spell. Insanity is the defense, not having the intent to commit the crime is a defense. But under the spell is something that comes out of the movies. What I think they're trying to do, which is not crazy at all, is trying to prepare the public, prepare a jury pool to find him not getting the death penalty. This is all about the death penalty. It's not about guilt or innocence. ZAHN: Is it going to work? TOOBIN: I don't know. I don't know. It's certainly not going to work in front of a jury to say someone's under the spell, because the judge will just instruct the jury, under the spell is not a defense. ZAHN: Now, we've seen this used before in court before, though, in the Patricia Hearst case. TOOBIN: We have indeed. The Patricia Hearst case... ZAHN: And remind us of what happened. TOOBIN: Well, just talk about a good case for that, for the defense. There's a woman who was kidnapped, no one said Malvo was kidnapped, she was kidnapped, dragged out of her apartment, and then apparently literally brainwashed, and got involved in bank robberies. She was prosecuted for the bank robberies and convicted. So the jury didn't buy the brainwashing defense. They certainly, especially in something like this, where you've got 10, 12 shootings, where someone could change their mind after each one, had the opportunity to leave, they're not going to buy it here. But I don't want to ridicule this too much, because there is a legitimate point here, which is that when dealing with the death penalty, a jury doesn't have to operate by the rules. They can use any rationale they want to find someone not worthy of the death penalty. ZAHN: So take us to that next step, then. So if there's any sympathy at all for this position, that Mr. Muhammad passed this kid off as his own, that this young man was terribly impressionable, is that really going to lighten the burden? TOOBIN: Well, it might. It might, it might when it comes to the death penalty, because he is 17. Muhammad is in his 40s. I",0.2614805890418445,2003-06-25

And in real life, there is drama. There are disagreements. There`s -- you know, this is young couple that`s in love. They are going to disagree. Probably, if there wasn`t so much attention on it and there wasn`t so much at stake, they probably would be working it out a little bit more and they wouldn`t be filing in 72 days. They probably, you know, would be working on this. But there`s so much at stake here. There`s a brand. There are things. And I`m not saying it is right and I`m not saying it`s wrong. I`m just saying it is what it is. HAMMER: And I hear you saying that and I don`t disagree, Lisa, except I don`t think for a moment that they were having these fights because the cameras were rolling. FLICKER: Exactly. GASTINEAU: Yes, they are. HAMMER: And these were not some petty issues here. GASTINEAU: Yes, they do. They do. (CROSS TALK) HAMMER: Oh, so you think they really didn`t have a disagreement about their last name? GASTINEAU: No. HAMMER: You think they made it all up? GASTINEAU: No, I don`t think -- I think those are normal things. Listen, when a famous woman marries a man, there`s always an issue. Catherine Zeta Jones is married to Michael Douglas but she still goes by Catherine Zeta Jones. These are normal things when a famous woman marries another person. So I think that, you know, for the cameras, these things were played up so that they can create more issues, because truthfully, this couple really, really was really in love. HAMMER: I hear you. I hear you, but I also know that Kim would be the first to say no when those cameras are rolling. You are just seeing our life as it truly plays out. We know that reality TV heightens the drama. We do realize that, Lisa. But I think, you know, watching this play back now -- I think it is very poignant. I do want to move right now though to SHOWBIZ TONIGHT`s Kardashian split clue number three. Kim goes solo to an event last Saturday night here in New York City.

1147573,1451143,CNN,Erin Burnett Outfront,"Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65 years old. And we've done some digging into his history and we found that he has a criminal history that dates back more than 30 years across three states, starting in 1980 in Texas with a DUI. In the '90s, he was charged with improper exhibition of a weapon. That was dropped. Then in 2000, he was charged with possession of marijuana. That's a first- degree misdemeanor, served six months probation. And then in December, charged with menacing a neighbor. Jimmy Davis Jr. says that he shot at his family after apparently he damaged the road that leads to the property line that they share. So this is a man that, again, in this community, not well-thought of and has a history that dates back to the '80s. BURNETT: And, Victor, what about the bus driver who Jimmy Lee Dykes shot point-blank and killed. He died trying to defend the children on that bus. What have you learned about his story? BLACKWELL: Yes, 66 years old, named Charles Poland. His friends call him Chuck. And I had to go a few miles away to the small town of Newton, where he's lived for decades. It's a population, 1,500, and it's a community where everyone knows virtually everyone else. And I spoke a woman who has known Chuck, as she calls him, for 20 years. And I asked her if she believes her friend deserves the title of hero. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CINDY MESSICK, SUPERVISOR, CHRISTIAN MISSION: I think it takes someone with a specialness to stand up to a man that's got a gun pointed at him and say, ""No, you're not having these children."" And to just go ahead and defy him and do what he did. It takes someone that is a hero. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLACKWELL: Chuck, as she calls him, has been married for 43 years. We've learned that his funeral will be Sunday morning in his hometown of Newton -- Erin. BURNETT: Victor, thank you. And now we go to Washington state, where officials are searching high and low for someone to help them grow pot. Colorado and Washington are the first states to legalize recreational marijuana use, but before they start producing and selling it in mass quantities, they say they need an expert in the proverbial field. You've heard about pot brownies. What if you could be paid to be the pot czar? Paul Vercammen is out front on the story.

CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. This is EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans. LAURA JARRETT, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Laura Jarrett. It's Friday, May 29th. It's 5:00 a.m. here in New York. And we begin with the breaking news. Violence and palpable outrage across the United States over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Angry crowds have gathered in several cities. They are demanding justice and accountability. In Minneapolis, protesters took to the streets for the third straight day. Some broke into the precinct near the scene of Floyd's death and set it on fire. Over 500 National Guard troops have been called in now. Let's go straight to CNN's Omar Jimenez live for us in Minneapolis. Omar, for those who might be waking up at this hour, walk us through accident happened overnight and what is happening right now? OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, for starters, Laura, what is happening right now is this portion of Minneapolis is on fire. I mean, you look at this building. This building is less than a block away from the Minneapolis police third precinct, the one that was broken into and set on fire yesterday by protesters. And now, this one here. Hours later, that fire is well-extinguished, but this one is burning out of control. There is a midsection of this building that just a few moments ago collapsed down, and you can see all the spectators that are here. There's one other person walked by saying it's unbelievable as they stand here and watch. No one seems to be demonstrating at this hour. They just seem to be standing back in awe. Now, I'll catch you up on what we have seen throughout the night. This is not an unfamiliar sight over the course or throughout this city. And it's something that Mayor Jacob Frey has actually pushed against, saying that he is in support of the protesting but not in support of the damage and some of the violence that we are seeing. We know the National Guard has been called in, 500 troops called into the area here. And as we -- just take a look at something here. But 500 National Guards members called into the area. We saw looting start to spread to the St. Paul side of the Twin Cities, as opposed to just here in Minneapolis as well. Again, of course the images of the police precinct, they have put up fences to try and keep protesters out over the course of the afternoon. Well, protesters got past the fences and the fires began shortly after. Fireworks were fired into the precinct. And there's one thing you may notice. The entire time we have been standing here with a fire of this magnitude, you don't see any firefighters. No fire trucks, no police officers, nothing.

GRAMMER: All right. MORGAN: I don't really mind what order you do it in, but -- but you already I think explained in a very, I think, profound way, why you think you drifted into -- I guess what turned out to be inappropriate relationships. But at the time maybe didn't seem so inappropriate. Did you struggle for a long time to have any meaningful relationship because of all the drugs, the partying, and everything else? Was it all inconsequential at the time? How did it feel to you? GRAMMER: It's interesting. I spent, oh, maybe about eight years not really settling down with anybody, kind of having, you know, peripheral relationship with people. I was mostly focused on acting, trying to get a job, doing some work. And then, when I came to New York, I met a girl. I was 28 years old, and I thought, you know, I'm tired of this. I actually want to settle down and I want to have a child. I thought, I'd like to start a family. So, I met my first wife. MORGAN: Doreen. GRAMMER: Doreen. And it went -- it went pretty poorly. MORGAN: Yes. And this lasted -- well, it last a while. GRAMMER: About a year. MORGAN: Yes. GRAMMER: But it -- well, this -- it took a long time to get divorced, which is interesting. I was in a five-year divorce, I think. MORGAN: You had a great daughter, Spencer. GRAMMER: We had a fantastic child, Spencer. MORGAN: So, that was a -- GRAMMER: It was wonderful, yes. MORGAN: Now, it's your second marriage that really starts -- this starts to really deteriorate. GRAMMER: Right. MORGAN: So, you married the stripper -- GRAMMER: Leigh-Anne. MORGAN: Leigh-Anne Csuhany. GRAMMER: Csuhany. MORGAN: Csuhany. GRAMMER: Csuhany, yes. MORGAN: In 1992. And that lasted a year. GRAMMER: That was a year. MORGAN: Lots of allegations of abuse, she fired a gun at you, there was talk of divorce, she attempted suicide. This was ""The National Enquirer"" for real. GRAMMER: Oh, it was horrible, yes. It was horrible. MORGAN: Did she fire a gun at you? GRAMMER: That was another night. That was before I married her. (LAUGHTER) MORGAN: You married her after she shot at you?

And we will be following that closely. Earlier today, I talked with our ""Legal Guys"" about the Jeffs case, asked if they were surprised that the jury in this case deliberated for just three hours. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AVERY FRIEDMAN, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: It would have been much longer, except he didn't put a defense on. The -- it really, I don't think, was a surprise to anyone. And what we learned in the trial was that Warren Jeffs and his Yearning for Zion wasn't yearning for Zion, he was yearning for children. And the evidence was overwhelming. There was no question but that we were looking at both a sexual assault and then an aggravated sexual assault. That's what the jury is thinking about right now in penalty, Joe, because they are now hearing evidence from many of the people that went through this experience, personal sexual experiences, as children. And that evidence will continue to be presented all the way through Monday, probably up to Tuesday, when they'll finally make a decision on how long he's going to spend in jail. You're looking at life, I think. JOHNS: Right. Do you agree, Richard? This is a case where you've got, you know, all this evidence. We're probably going to reach some type of decision on the sentencing phase around Tuesday. Do you think this is life in prison? RICHARD HERMAN, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Joe, if they could give him more than life, they would do that. This guy made a big mistake. He messed with Texas. And I -- you know, you don't want to do that. So now this ex-prophet, current child rapist, who is going to get sentenced, is going to get hammered by this jury. The tape recordings that were played for this jury were devastating. It was not a complex case, Joe. It was a streamlined prosecution. Other prosecution should learn from this -- Orlando. Anyway, it was a streamlined prosecution, Joe, and the jury just ate it up. It was a horrific case. And Avery's right. He put on no defense. He sat there like a lunatic. He fired all of his attorneys. Now during the sentencing phase, he stands up in court and tells the judge, Remove me from the court. I can't see my religion persecuted like this. So the judge said, Fine, you're out. (CROSSTALK) JOHNS: But I got to ask you both... HERMAN: ... put in one of his old attorneys to represent him. Yes, I mean, it's brutal.

But, with respect to your specific, broader question, the transnational criminal organizations, the coyotes and those who traffic in people and illicit goods, do it as a business. So, yes, they exploit any reason in which somebody might have the opportunity to either receive a benefit that they do not qualify for, or to be able to stay in this country in an illegal status. They have that information. They provide it to those, and encourage them to take that dangerous journey, in exchange for a false promise that they will not be captured and deported by the United States. GRASSLEY: Have you seen a decrease in the unaccompanied alien children asylum cases, since decision to an -- end the Central American Minor program? NELSEN: Sir, we have seen some decreases overall, but I would like to point out, unfortunately, we have a 30 percent increase in UACs from October through December. And we also have a 68 percent increase in family units during that same time period. GRASSLEY: As you know, Congress is currently considering a number of young men and women to provide legal status to in any potential deal on DACA. Some people, like this senator, believe that we should limit any status to the 690,000 individuals currently enrolled in DACA. These young men and women came out of the shadows and built their life around DACA. They were brought to this country through no fault of their own, and didn't make a conscious choice to break our nation's laws. I believe there is an equity issue that necessitates addressing their status. However, that equity issue isn't present for their parents. Those men and women did choose to violate our nation laws and did make a conscious choice to immigrate here without papers. We shouldn't reward that behavior. Reports suggest several of my colleagues are now considering providing legal work authorization to these individuals. To the best of your knowledge -- my first question -- how many million of people would benefit from an amnesty that provides work authorization to the parents of Dreamers? NIELSEN: Sir, what I would say is I can tell you the number of DACA registers -- registered, which, as you said, is 690,000 -- 690,000 is the number that the Department of Homeland Security begins with in any discussion. There are a variety of bills that you know that then -- takes that population and expands it by either increasing the time period in which they could have first entered, increasing the age for which one is considered to be a so-called ""Dreamer"" and/or capturing family members and providing and some sort of status, as well. I would just say, though, that it is our position to find a permanent solution. We are not interested in addressing this through piecemeal, through year-after-year renewals, through anything less than a permanent solution.

Schlafly is traveling with Forbes on his bus throughout Iowa touting his anti-abortion views. PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY, EAGLE FORUM PRESIDENT: If I were in Iowa next Monday, I would be voting for Steve Forbes in the caucus next year. DAVIS: Forbes has spent more days touring Iowa than any other candidate, most of it on board his campaign bus. On Monday, it's Sheldon, a town so small the grain elevator dwarfs Main Street. On Tuesday, Forbes is on the move again, this time in Carol, Iowa. The towns may be small, but Forbes' audiences are sizable: 200 in Sheldon, 300 in Carol. They like his anti-tax, anti-politician rhetoric. STEVE FORBES (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This coat is going into the dumpster of history, and if you lobbyists don't like it, then you are going to have to find another line of work. We're in charge again.

But he is virtually assured of appointing as many judges to the Supreme Court as each of his three predecessors did and could reshape Americans' lives even more significantly. It is the craziest dissonance. The cruelest, too. How do you think Donald Trump is going to reshape this country? FRANK BRUNI, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean, he is going to do it when he appoints his second Supreme Court justice but he has done with a tax overhaul, he is doing it with, you know, max mentioned tariffs before. I mean, issue after issue. What is so interesting about it when you step back and that is why I wrote that column, is he's doing all of this when he has such a tenuous claim to a mandate. You know, if you look at the way he was elected, if he was a normal person, he would govern with some humility and he would go for some bipartisanship because he would look at those numbers. He only won the electoral college as we remember by 77,000 votes in three particular states. And that was in the climate I mentioned in the column. I mean, you know, he did not have a very flawed opponent. He may have had help that worked from Russia. We know he had help from Russia. We don't know whether it was consequential in terms of the outcome. We know from most analyses that what Comey did toward the end probably helped him. He does not have a legitimate plan, some majority support in this country. Nothing about the way he's governed reflects that. And I think that's what makes his opponents so incredibly crazy and I think it's what makes all of this feel so surreal to so many Americans. LEMON: Someone just said something in response to this. Very interesting. He said in the coming decades or in a generation or two, we may be -- this country may be run by a minority of people, right, meaning demographically, people who are in power holding on just because of what Donald Trump is doing with the judiciary. The majority of the country won't have control over its fate. The minority of the country will be controlling that. MAX BOOT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, that's a real concern. I mean, as Frank was pointing out, I mean, Donald Trump is basically a minority president and yet he is ruling in a very heavy-handed fashion. And I really blame the Republicans and especially the Republicans on the Hill for letting him get away with it. I mean, it's crazy how Donald Trump has developed 90 percent Republican support. Republicans are afraid to press back against him on anything, even though he is doing great damage and violence to what they have stood for decades.

So let me read a little chunk of Maraniss says in his new book. He says, ""It's important to say it falls into the realm of literature and memoir, not history and autobiography and should not be read as a rigorously factual account. The character creations and rearrangements of the book are not merely a matter of style, devices of compression, but are also substantive. What exactly are the discrepancies between what everybody has read in President Obama's book back in 1995, ""Dreams of my Father"" and this new book? BEN SMITH, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, ""BUZZFEED"": Well, eventually two different sets of fact checks and Maraniss', you know, great book, which is not just a fact checking document for sure. The stories of Obama were told by his family, but turned out not to be true. Some of them kind of legends and things of his grandparents had done, which didn't turn out to have happened, from meeting Herbert Hoover to fighting colonial struggles, which are apparently typical. Things his mother told him about his father to protect him. Again, then there's a set of things where Obama had retold his own story. ""Dreams For My Father"" is very much about race, the subtitle is a story of race. And he had rearranged things in his life and turned white characters black and emphasized race and created new characters. There's one woman who, a college acquaintance of his who kind of was very central to his politics who was Swedish and made her black to kind of tell a very specific story. And I think it's a narrative device, but it's really unusual situation, which a politician has completely controlled with his own memoir so the revision is interesting. HOOVER: You talk about this conspiracy between the president and his highest critics because he's ended up inadvertently fueling the things that conservatives fear most about him. SMITH: Right, what's so interesting is that, I think in a lot of cases, somebody's political enemies, their instinct would be to debunk thinks, but he makes himself look like a wilder kid than he was. Like he did more drugs and suggesting, if he says he used cocaine and nobody has proved that and that may actually be made up. The people who would go after him or are trying to kind of prove that he was even crazier than in his memoir and he thinks his life was tamer. O'BRIEN: To what end? Why would you do that? I mean, why would you say -- especially this book was written when he was on the cusp of a political career and sort of thinking -- the conversations about race, even just the overall conversations about him. I sort of get why you start framing, who I am, where do I come from, why would you make up how much pot you smoked and if you",0.9887987144378858,2012-06-18

We're going to be on the road again real soon, but here we go with what is making the LIST on this day, a lot of stories that we could put on first. There's sports, sexual harassment, how pro athletes should treat women assigned to report on them. This is a story, by the way, that has been generating a lot of buzz all over the country, on Twitter, certainly on the Internet and on radio and television as well. And here's why we're talking about this. Let me break this down for you, in case you -- in case you haven't heard. The NFL is now investigating whether the coach for the New York Jets, Rex Ryan, a member of his staff, other coaches on the team, and many, many of the players behaved extremely inappropriately toward a female reporter who was working for Mexico's TV Azteca while they were at the Jets training facility. All right, there's the reporter, OK? Her name is Ines Sainz. She was at the Jets practice camp this weekend. She was there to do an interview with one of the few Latino quarterbacks in all of the NFL. That would be, of course, Mark Sanchez. But according to reports, members of the Jets coaching staff and the team started deliberately overthrowing passes, so they could be near her. OK. That continued for quite some time. But then it continued some more. And then they continued doing it, to the point of being obnoxious. Also, according to the team, according to reports there, the team started then -- when they went into the locker room, they saw her there and starting hooting and hollering and, well, according to some that were there, just embarrassing themselves and the female reporter. This all happening just as Sainz, this female reporter, was walking into the locker room. Now, a lot has been made of what Sainz said on her Twitter page about what happened Saturday. Today, she's saying that, look, she wasn't offended. We have got a picture, by the way, of what her Twitter page looks like. There she is, attractive young lady that she is, obviously. But did that call for the players behaving this way? And even if the players did, shouldn't the coaches, shouldn't some of the NFL officials, shouldn't somebody have pulled them back and said, OK, guys, enough? Well, there are some things going on with this story that I want to bring you up to date with. And to do that, I'm going to -- I'm going to that enlist the help of ""USA Today"" sports columnist Christine Brennan, who is good enough to join us here once again. I want to take you through a couple of things. We have got a couple of statements here, Christine, which kind of let viewers know why this thing has gotten where it is.

(END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES (on camera): I mean, just wow! I mean, when we talk about the future of the party, is this it? That they actually support someone who said all these things? Is this not racing at top speed towards an extremist fringe of the party? And if so, what are the risks to party, and for that matter, country? HEYE: Well, I think it goes back to decisions that and have been made not just four years ago with Donald Trump, but even before that. You and I have talked about this. To me, Donald Trump wasn't just the problem, he was also a symptom of what the problem was. He just exacerbated it and really put it on work speed. And that's put us to where we are today. Donald Trump can't tweet. He can't go on Facebook to say the incendiary things that he has in the past right now. But he has -- he's inspired people to do that, which ultimately, you know, goes back to January 6th. Meanwhile, the Republican Party has real problems on how it can move forward and real problems of division amongst itself. It's not a recipe for success. They could still take back the House in 2022. The problem with that, Michael, is Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to be the face of the Republican Party, whether she wants it or not, or other Republicans wanted or not. And every competitive congressional seat or Senate seat, she is going to be an issue that Republicans are going to have to be talking about, not talking about what they want to do for their state or their district, that's a problem. HOLMES: yes. They're going to have their own it. I mean, 200 Republicans voted to keep her on those committees. I mean, as you noted, too, I was reading today, I mean, the fact that House chair, Liz Cheney, won a vote on her position 145 to 61, what that shows as you point out, is that when the ballots are secret you see perhaps a different private caucus than the public one. What are Republicans so afraid of? HEYE: Well, it's very simple, their voters. I dealt with this all the time when I work on House leadership. We would call them the vote no, hope yes caucus. These are members of Congress who would say to you on the House floor, yes, I know this is a good bill, it's a smart idea, but I can't vote for it. And that would be their excuse on everything.

I'm meeting with constituents. If they have a better approach, I'm anxious to hear it. But I haven't heard it yet. BLITZER: In our new poll, we also asked this question, Congressman. How is President Obama handling the U.S. relationship with Iran? Thirty-eight percent approve of the job he's doing, but 60 percent disapprove. What does he need to do to convince the American public that he's on the right track here? SMITH: I mean, that's -- I'm not sure what he needs to do to convince the American public. But I think what he needs to do to convince Congress is keep talking about the details of this agreement. Look, I mean, it's -- again, we have a whole lot of issues with Iran that have nothing to do with their nuclear program. But if you're solely focused on the nuclear program, that's what this agreement was trying to do. I think what he would have to convince them is he's aware that it's not just about the nuclear program, that there is much more that we need to do. We need to work with Israel, as I said. We need to work with our Arab allies to try to contain a lot of the things that Iran is doing. I think that's the point is to make sure that we know that this is not the only problem with Iran, but it is one very big one. We do not want an Iran with a nuclear weapon. How do we stop that? This agreement does as effective a job of it as anything that has thus far been presented to me. BLITZER: All right, Congressman, stand by. We have more to discuss, including our top story, the new escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Don't forget, North Korea does have a nuclear bomb, maybe a dozen, maybe on their way to 100. Much more with Congressman Adam Smith when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: We're back with the top Democrat in the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Adam Smith of Washington State. Congressman, the United States, as you know, right now closely monitoring -- the tensions seemingly escalating on the Korean Peninsula along the DMZ, where the U.S. still has about 30,000 troops. These are the first clashes we have seen now in about five years between North and South Korea. At this time, though, as you well know, North Korea does have a nuclear bomb, maybe a dozen, maybe even more. How concerned are you right now that what has happened over the past 20 years in North Korea, they went ahead and developed a nuclear bomb, even though in the '90s, during the Bill Clinton administration, they worked out a deal to kill their nuclear program? How worried are you that Iran might do the same thing? SMITH: Iran is",0.1435782556750298,2015-08-20

Some more than 90 percent of the heroin used throughout the entire world, talking about in Europe, through the United States, is grown right here in Afghanistan. And it is generating billions and billions of dollars. Some of that money going to the hands of the Taliban who tax farmers to allow the opium to go through their territory, who receive protection money from the farmers. So CNN's Randi Kaye now takes a look at how drug use in America, how heroin use in some parts of America, most notably Chicago and St. Louis, how some of that money ends up back in the hands of the Taliban. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This undercover narcotic team from St. Louis County is chasing a suspected heroin dealer. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a black male in the vehicle. And a white and red shirt on and blue jeans. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The guy didn't have any on him, but he's going to take him to a location where he can get what we wanted. KAYE: We tail the officer and the suspect. They're riding in the undercover officer's car. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any time you put somebody in your car, it's not good. KAYE: Officers hope the suspected dealer will lead them to what they call china white. Heroin so pure, so potent, so powerful it killed 55 people in St. Louis in just the first six months of this year. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From Sacramento. KAYE: The suspect makes a buy on the street and gets back in the car. When he and the undercover cop move on, the other officers pounce on the guy who sold him the drugs. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cuff him. Cuff him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't swallow anything. You understand? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir. KAYE: Turns out, this time it wasn't heroin. This guy was charged with selling crack cocaine. And the suspect in the car got away at the next stop while pretending to make another buy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Release that. KAYE: But officers say they do catch someone selling heroin virtually every night of the week. One recent bust netted $20 million worth of china white. (on camera) Who's selling it here in St. Louis? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're seeing it sold by street corner dealers, in some of the worst neighborhoods. And by well off teenage girls in some of the more expensive neighborhoods. KAYE (voice-over): Sellers likely have no idea the Taliban in Afghanistan is supplying the heroin they deal in the U.S. The DEA says the Taliban is to blame for Afghanistan's explosion in opium poppy, the raw ingredient used to make heroin. (on camera) How does the heroin get from Afghanistan to St. Louis? Captain Jackson says it first goes to Nigeria, then to street gangs in Chicago. From there, it makes its way here.

BLITZER: We'll see when he releases all those documents, if in fact he does release those documents. We'll see what happens. You know, one of the most important photo opportunities I saw this past week was Mitt Romney getting an endorsement from Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey. It was a very significant development. I suspect very helpful for Mitt Romney. BORGER: I think it is helpful for Mitt Romney, first of all, because Chris Christie is a great advocate. He is known as the real deal. He is an authentic guy. And Mitt Romney's problem is that people worry that he's not an authentic guy. So to have Chris Christie's endorsement really helps on that front. It doesn't help him so much with the Republican base which is still going to remain just as skeptical about Mitt Romney. Chris Christie was not a favorite with the conservative base of the party either. I think in the long term he's a great advocate. He's a great ally and he can help Mitt Romney raise a lot of money. BLITZER: Despite all of Chris Christie's protestations that he is not interested in being a number two, is that potentially the ticket out there? Mitt Romney, Chris Christie? BORGER: I think probably not. Because I think you don't want two Northeastern conservative Republicans because conservatives from the South or the West might question how conservative they are. And I think when I look at Mitt Romney, I say OK, well, he's going to want to win a couple of states if he becomes a nominee. So maybe Mark Rubio, for example, or Ohio, Rob Portman from Ohio, would be a very, very interesting running mate. BLITZER: As Ohio goes, almost always goes the nation. BORGER: You got it. BLITZER: Florida, critically important, Marco Rubio, he's a huge rising star. And Portman is a rising star as well. BORGER: And Portman is on the super committee which will be interesting to see how he behaves on that, and what he supports. BLITZER: All right. A little early speculation is always fun. BORGER: Yes, why not? BLITZER: Thanks, Gloria. Once again, a reminder, please be sure to join CNN for the Western Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas.

At the same time, exports in the United States -- to the United States -- have grown exponentially. It's obvious that inspecting one out of every 100 shipments is not good enough. And this commission has to wake up to reality. Either they should do the job or get out of town. ROMANS: So what can Congress do about it? I mean my question is, so many of these toys have already been designed, manufactured, ordered and are on ships coming here for the holiday shopping season. You know, what can Congress do to make sure that our agencies are doing their jobs, our retailers and importers are doing their jobs and that, you know, we're just not relying on a fly-by-night supplier of a supplier of a supplier somewhere in China that could make a mistake? DURBIN: Well, I'm the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for this commission. They're going to have more resources, more availability for inspectors and testing laboratories and the kind of computers they need to follow these shipments. But they have to take a much more aggressive attitude when it comes to dealing with these products. And I don't like the responses that I've heard out of this commission over the last several weeks. It is the kind of weak approach which really doesn't give confidence to consumers across America, who count on their government to make sure that products are safe. ROMANS: Senator, this whole thing started with imported food safety, with the pet foot scandal. And you've looked at this, as well. You've continued to work on improving the standards for food imports. Last month, you introduced the Imported Foods Security Act of 2007. You want to have import user fees. DURBIN: You bet. ROMANS: you want to require food safety research and food import certification. Quickly, tell me about what this would do to make our imported food more safe. DURBIN: A modest fee of $20 or $50 will gather enough resources to put more inspectors on the job, so we look at more shipments of food and products coming into this country to make them safe. It's not going to increase the overall cost of individual units, but it's really going to give consumers more confidence. Look at this pet food scandal. Innocent dogs and cats across America dying because the Chinese sent us some chemically tainted shipment. That's unacceptable. Toothpaste with anti-freeze in it from China; lead toys that are dangerous; magnets that kids swallow and die; now lead paint on vehicle -- on these little cars that these kids use. All of that's unacceptable. We've got to have the resources to have the cops on the beat so that American consumers are protected. ROMANS: All right.

1888229,2204450,CNN,Don Lemon Tonight,"Corporate America has been pretty happy with Trump. And I think that, you know, you see especially this sort of coastal elite billionaires like Bloomberg registering these kinds of objections. You're not hearing so much from, you know, proprietaries of say petroleum product company based in Wichita. In general, they kept their mouth shut. They kept funding conservative causes if they were before. They're very happy with the tax legislation and they are not so bothered by some of the cultural stuff or they may even be wholeheartedly on board with it. So, you know, I don't think -- there have been defections from the Republican donor class. There have -- we have seen a trickle of big name Republican donors actually come out and say, you know, for example, that they want to see the Republicans support immigration, for example. But it's a trickle. And I think for the most part, you do have a corporate class that's pretty much on board. A steady hand, sure, they would like a steady hand. The next best thing to that is an administration that is more devoted to, you know, corporate tax cuts and deregulation than any we've seen. COHAN: Can I interject something real quick? I'm a big fan of Molly Ball, but she is wrong about the Koch brothers who live in Wichita, have come out against Trump on his tariffs, and so there's some big Republican donors who are objecting, and they live in Wichita. LEMON: I think she's speaking in general. COHAN: No, I know. LEMON: They're happy with tax policies that help -- COHAN: She's right. LEMON: But what does this -- companies that rely on consumers, it's a bit different. Because if you look at -- look at what happened to businesses stepping forward today. American, United, Frontier, Southwest Airlines releasing statements asking government not to fly immigrant children separated from their families on airplanes and so on. You think it's different when it comes to companies that rely on consumers? BURNS: Look, I think it's important to distinguish where individual CEOs and independently sort of activist companies get involved versus where companies with big consumer bases like Delta and American Airlines decide they need to stand up to the administration on something. It's not because they're pushing an ideological agenda. It's ultimately less about the corporation deciding to be political than it is about fearing their consumer base. It's why a lot of the companies that have clashed with the administration, that haven't tried to sort of, you know, find accommodations or see themselves out of the fight have been companies with these sort of upscale relatively educated consumer bases that don't like the president or offended by his policies on things like immigration, on issues like transgender rights.

They really love this slippery slope that they're trying to push a few people over. Well, I'll have a few thoughts for them to chew on. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DOBBS: The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission spends about $83 million a year in its attempt to keep unsafe products out of the hands of consumers. But as Kitty Pilgrim now reports, the federal government could learn a thing or two about enforcing product safety from a Chicago grandmother. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KITTY PILGRIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This Chicago baby has one very smart grandmother. Marilyn Furer grew concerned as she watched her young grandson Jensen gum his vinyl bib. The bib was bought at Wal-Mart and made in China. Marilyn knew about the risks of lead in soft plastic. She had already looked at the safety of her grandchildren's lunch boxes. So she bought another lead test kit from the hardware store. MARILYN FURER, CONSUMER ACTIVIST: You can't be too safe with kids, right? So I tested it, and to my utter disillusionment and disbelief, I found lead. PILGRIM: The lead content proved 16 times as high as the government permits for paint. She sent it to a consumer group, Center for Environmental Health, who also tested and found lead. The State of Illinois stepped in and demanded a recall. Wal-Mart agreed to a voluntary recall in Illinois and removed the bibs from store shelves nationwide. The bibs have been sold in many stores since 2004 and the federal government was nowhere to be seen. MICHAEL GREEN, CTR. FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH: There is no federal lead standard for children's products. There is a federal lead standard for paint but not for children's products. We think that needs to change. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm embarrassed for our government that they don't have strong testing procedures in place. PILGRIM: Even now the Consumer Products Safety Commission does not ban the sale of the bibs. It simply warns to be aware of cracking. But the agency stopped short of a full recall because they say that without deterioration, the risk of actual lead exposure is low. Marilyn Furer is outraged. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's like putting a lead pencil in their mouth and saying, here, baby, suck on this. PILGRIM: So for now it's every grandmother for herself. (END VIDEOTAPE) PILGRIM: Now Senator Barack Obama along with senators Durbin and Clinton have proposed legislation to require the Consumer Products Safety Commission to ban any children's toy which contains lead. Now this bill would also put the burden on U.S. importers and retailers to make sure they are not selling any Chinese products containing lead -- Lou. DOBBS: Well, and you notice that Kitty Pilgrim reported to you which senators are pushing this legislation.

707274,968461,CNN,Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees,"Roy Frankhauser of the Klan of Berks County started showing up just outside my office, every day, for hours at a time, taking my picture, basically telling me he is watching me. COOPER: Did authorities do anything about this? JOUHARI: Nothing. COOPER: Why not? JOUHARI: Well, you know, I think part of it, Anderson, is ignorance. I think that is still part of the problem. The view there, even though Mr. Frankhauser was arrested more than 140 times and had been accused of horrendous crimes in his time, they viewed him as an old dried up Klansman who really wasn't going to hurt anything. You don't need to worry about the people online. They are just talking. They are really not going to hurt you. COOPER: You won this federal civil suit against him, against the KKK and against another group. I think that is the first time someone has actually won a suit against Internet based harassment, is that correct? JOUHARI: It is. It is the only one like it in the world as far as I know. COOPER: Did you collect any money. I think you won -- you were awarded like a million dollars? JOUHARI: We were awarded way over a million dollars but it's up to the United States Attorney's office to collect the money and that has never been done. COOPER: You would think the story ends there but it doesn't. You basically moved multiple times because you say you are still being harassed. JOUHARI: Yes. COOPER: How does that happen? JOUHARI: Well, you know, I think with the age of the Internet, Anderson, it is hard to hide. You only need to go out and get a blockbuster card or a check cashing card or anything that goes on the Internet, you pay 20 bucks and you can find anybody. Now that the White Supremacists and the Klan have gone behind computer screens at office street corners, this information is communicated worldwide in seconds. We moved because we got no protection of our identity I had no choice. My daughter, who was then 16 and is biracial, once they found that out I mean they started harassing her. They put her on the Web. We had to keep moving because I had to find a way to protect her and continue to hope that the authorities would step in and help. But it didn't happen. COOPER: What went through your mind when you heard about the shooting at the Holocaust Memorial? JOUHARI: Anderson, I was horrified. In the past couple of months I have been thinking about what I should do. I obviously got out of the civil rights work at least actively because of my daughter and her family. And then I got involved with President Obama's campaign as a delegate and, you know, tried to decide do I want to take a chance and come out here again.

CORNYN: I remember, a few years back, in Hidalgo, Texas -- Hidalgo County, Texas, using that same local stakeholder input approach, we were able to come up with a win-win proposition. You're familiar with the levee wall. NIELSEN: Yes, sir. CORNYN: There was obviously a need to improve the levee system down there and protect property values and to make flood insurance affordable. But, in consultation -- I remember J.D. Salinas, who was the -- who was the county judge in Hidalgo, Texas -- they put a bond election on the -- on the ballot, and came up with a dual-use system, which actually provided that levee improvement, but also provided a wall in critical areas that the Border Patrol -- that they said they needed in order to slow down the flow of illegal immigration and drug trafficking and the like. So that's just one example of what I consider a win-win proposition and where one size does not fit all. So I appreciate your willingness to work with all of us to come up with those kind of win-win situations, where possible. Chief Padilla told me that the majority of people who are coming across the border and who are detained in the Rio Grande Valley sector are from Central America. I can't remember the exact percentage, but it's a high percentage, as you know. And what these traffickers are doing is exploiting, as you point out, a vulnerability in our system. We passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act years ago, in order to protect children from human trafficking. It's a highly worthy cause. NIELSEN: Agree. CORNYN: But the traffickers have now figured out that -- since children who come from Central America are treated differently than other people who enter the country illegally, they have found a way to exploit it. And I believe you mentioned that 90 percent of them who were notified of a future court hearing on their claim for asylum, for example, never show up. And that's a real glitch. But I know there's been some attention paid -- not enough attention paid, in my view -- to the threat of criminal gangs that exploit this vulnerability, as well. I was told by Chief Padilla, again, that they're -- they have MS-13 gang members as young as 12 years old, and of course, from 12 to 17, you'd still qualify as a minor. And let me ask, if border patrol identifies, by the tattoos or other signs on a -- on a -- somebody under 18, that they are likely a member of a criminal gang, are they permitted to detain them? Or are they required to treat them same way they would every other minor child, and place them with a sponsor, ultimately, and -- only to have them never show back up for their court hearing in the future?

But the two parties have very different views on whether the war in Iraq or the broader war against terrorism should be the main focus of their campaigns. Bill Schneider reports on their conundrum. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST (voice-over): For Democrats and Republicans, the midterm election is framed around different issues. At the top of the Democrats' list, Iraq. Terrorism ranks lower, not because Democrats are unconcerned about terrorism, but because they believe the war in Iraq is a dangerous distraction. LANNY DAVIS, FORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: We want the focus to be on terrorism, not on being involved in a civil war in Iraq. SCHNEIDER: For Republicans, terrorism is at the top of the list, Iraq at the bottom, not because Republicans downplay the importance of Iraq, but because they see it as part of the war on terror, we are fighting an enemy that threatens us.

But then as I continued to hear it, her face started to get a little concerned, a little confused. Then I got up just to check things out. And before I even made it to the door, I heard a very distinct bullet go right by the door and hit something. And that's when I ran back to my desk and grabbed a bunch of keys and fumbled at the door, trying to find one to lock. (END VIDEO CLIP) ALLEN: Joining me now is Steve Moore, he's a former supervisory special agent for the FBI, he is live via Skype from Los Angeles. Steve, as we listen to -- ALLEN: -- these people in other buildings that heard these gunshots and we talk about the people who were shot, so many of them. The man killed an officer and two citizens. He shot many others, five other officers. From what you are hearing about this, what do you think was the situation that so many police officers were shot? I can remember; we have too many mass shootings in this country but I can't remember that many police officers being shot. STEVE MOORE, FORMER SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT, FBI: Well, I think what you had is a call go out, that shots were fired and I know police officers. My brother-in-law and my cousin are both police officers; these people are the ones who go towards the gunfire, not away from the gunfire. And the shooter had, I'm guessing, an AK-47 because these bullets were going through several buildings at a time. He could reach out and hit them through their squad car doors when they were hundreds of yards away. So their response -- they had no idea how close they could get before they were a target. And their first warning was bullets coming through the car. That's what being a policeman is like. ALLEN: Yes. You never know the power of the shooters and many times they're have more power than the police officers, sad to say. MOORE: Most of the time. ALLEN: Yes. Three people died, 12 altogether shot. I know you don't want to second-guess how the police worked this out because they did get him to surrender. But why do you think they didn't move in on him sooner? MOORE: You know, I was looking at that and I'd been listening to the reports as they come in and continually come in. From what I am guessing, I believe that you will find that the shooter got in, the casualties occurred right at the initial part of his attack and then he found himself locked out of everywhere.

First off, great stick-to-it-iveness on your part. What are some of the biggest obstacles that young African-Americans are facing right now in the job market? MIA JACKSON, APPLYING FOR MBA PROGRAMS: I think some of the biggest obstacles is trying to be creative and trying to stay within our jobs and be able to perform and be as competitive with our counterparts. But I think the main thing is, try to reinvent ourselves and have all the tools in our tool kits to be successful, so... COLLINS: Every young person is trying to do that. What is different about being African-American and having these same challenges in this same economy? JACKSON: I think it's more, it has to do with confidence, too. I think it's some things we have, some perceptions. I think some people have perceptions of us, and we have perceptions of ourselves that when we walk into a room, you know, we have to have the confidence that we belong there. And it may be subtle, but I think it's very important when you're working in a workplace, a diverse workplace. COLLINS: Sonia, I know that you cover career development and diversity, transfer ""Black Enterprise"" magazine. What in your mind are some of these obstacles that are African-American, specifically -- what makes the difference in the job market and workplace for African- Americans? SONIA ALLEYNE, BLACK ENTERPRISE MAGAZINE: Mia outlined many of them. That's why it's important for African-Americans and minorities in general to make sure they have mentor support and a very strong network. COLLINS: Is that out there? Is that easy to come by? ALLEYNE: You know, it is. It is if you search for it and seek it out. What is great about a lot of the companies today, particularly those who are heavily recruiting for an entry-level position, is that they do have these set ups. They have formal programs set up internally. So, even if a new entrance is a little leery about, you know, approaching someone herself, there are programs that are set up in major institutions to help them go through the process. But mentoring is a single most important thing that you can actually do to alleviate some of the stress and frustration and gain that confidence that Mia's talking about. COLLINS: Yes, absolutely.

And we need to decide what to do with their schooling this year. The two options are in person five days a week with masks and social distancing, or virtual online learning five days a week, we think they would do fine with virtual learning but probably a little less strong on the education front and would also be losing the socialization, but at the same time, it would be less risky. Just wondering what you would choose in the situation. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: It's a tough one Dr. Fauci, I mean for so many parents. FAUCI: You know it is, but let me just take a very brief general principle that in general, we should try as best as we possibly can to get the children back to school, because we know the deleterious consequences on the children when they kept out of school, as well as the downstream, deleterious unintended consequences on families of parents who have to get off work to take care of the kids. Having said that, there's a however there, and that, however, is that we live in a big country, and the level of virus in one part of the country versus another can be very different. So, if you have a level of virus that really is very, very low, then you could likely proceed with impunity, depending on the local situation with getting the child back to school with no restrictions. If you're in an area where there is some virus involved. The local authorities may do things like try to modify the school situation, namely, alternate days, morning, afternoon, some outdoor, classes wearing masks. And then when you're in a situation where there's a lot of virus, where you really have an explosion of virus, then you might want to think twice. The bottom line, Sanjay, you've got to be flexible. You've got to be flexible according to the situation on the ground. And it's a local decision. So I would ask this caller, take a look at what the situation is in the location where you're at and abide by what the local authorities are saying.

In the United States through the end of September, there were 7 million symptomatic cases reported. However, the CDC scientists said there could have been as many as 42 million symptomatic cases in reality.

Elizabeth Cohen, thank you so much for that. That last report may not be well received by Republican Senator Marco Rubio. Rubio is taken to Twitter to complain that coverage of the pandemic is politically biased. Writing quote, on COVID, media emphasized bad news even when we had positive developments, part of a broader pattern of characterizing everything as bad news Republicans are to be blamed for. I'm not exactly sure how else we could find a way to frame or dig up optimism other than recent positive news about a vaccine regarding a global pandemic that's killed more than 262,000 Americans so far and crippled our economy.

SUSAN GLASSER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, thank you, Boris, and happy Thanksgiving to you too as well. Look, let's be terrible on the holiday and say that, you know, maybe he just misspoke by somehow casting a deadly pandemic as a media story and the idea that we're supposed to have cheery upbeat news about it. You know, it's interesting that you said perhaps he's imitating President Trump. I have noticed a much more strident tone coming from Senator Rubio in recent days. I missed the part where he congratulated Vice President, former Vice President Joe Biden, President-elect Joe Biden. And instead he went right the other day to criticizing Biden's new foreign policy team and suggesting he wouldn't be looking favorably on confirming them. Same thing, when I read that tweet about the media. I think that, you know, he's conflating Congress's lack of action, the White House's lack of action on the coronavirus with somehow a messaging issue. It's not a messaging story when there's 260,000 Americans dead, unfortunately. And the point about the vaccine is an important one. These are major breakthroughs.",0.21965938541281,2020-11-26

MCEDWARDS: Saudi officials say 172 militants have been seized, along with a huge array of weapons, millions of dollars in cash, as well. CLANCY: Now, the Saudis are telling us the militants were planning to attack oil facilities, military installations, even some senior government officials. MCEDWARDS: Now, the Interior Ministry tells us that some suspects had trained abroad to fly aircraft, raising fears that may have been planning a September 11th-style attack. Now, a Saudi intelligence official telling CNN the militants are part of an al Qaeda linked cell, or cells, plural, that play have been on the government's radar, not just for months, but for years. Our own Nic Robertson joins us now to fill us in on that and other details of the operation. What stands out in your mind, Nic, when you look at this one? ROBERTS: Well, I think -- and this has just been echoed by U.S. intelligence officials who have looked at this, and this says that there is still a serious terror threat, an al Qaeda threat, in Saudi Arabia. That's their view of these arrests. What it does show is that the -- that they are getting more complex and sophisticated in their attacks. It's taken nine months for the Saudis to track down all these potential attackers. Not only were they planning to attack inside Saudi Arabia, they were also planning to finance al Qaeda fighters going into Iraq. They were planning to send some of that money, the $5 million-plus that was captured in Saudi Arabia, planning to send some of that with fighters into Iraq. The big picture is al Qaeda is a threat in Saudi Arabia. They are planning to attack",0.1312550687070344,2007-04-27

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) KEILAR: The third hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in six weeks could be headed straight for the Gulf Coast and that also includes New Orleans as part of this area we are talking about. So, all eyes is what is up with tropical storm Nate. It's already caused deadly flooding across parts of Central America. At least 21 people were killed in Honduras, Costa Rica, as well as Nicaragua. So, I want to get now to CNN Weather Center meteorologist, Allison Chinchar. You have an update on the warnings. What are you looking at? ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Right now, we're taking a look at where tropical Nate is. We do have warnings out for areas of the Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba. But we've also started to get a lot in areas of the U.S. Because that's where we expect the storm to continue to move. Right now, the biggest area where we expect the intensification to occur is going to be out over the open Gulf. It will re-enter into much warmer water and in doing so that will allow the storm to intensify. The question is, how quickly can it intensify? Because it doesn't have much time from where it's located until it would actually make landfall into the U.S. Right now, the National Hurricane Center believes it will end up making landfall as a category 1 storm. But we do have some other models that are suggesting it could get slightly higher than that. So, time will tell in terms of this. Right now, landfall looks to be late Saturday night local time for a lot of these areas. Then from there it continues up to impact at least about a dozen other states, including cities like Atlantic, Washington D.C., New York, even Boston. So, we've got the tropical storm watches and warnings, that's the yellow and blue color, as hurricane watches and warnings, that's the yellow and the blue color. As well as hurricane watches and warnings. The red and pink color along the Gulf Coast from areas of Louisiana through Florida. Cities Like New Orleans, Biloxi, Mobile could expect storm surge up to four or seven feet. Whereas areas of Pensacola and Panama City, Florida likely to see storm surge about two to four feet. This is going to be a big concern for a lot of these areas. Because of that we do have storm surge warnings out for a lot of these areas along the Gulf Coast. And that will go starting tomorrow lasting all day through the evening. As well as, Brianna, the threat for strong winds. Areas at landfall could experience gusts up to 60 to up to100- mile-per-hour.

In the crossfire, National Economic Adviser Gene Sperling, and Assistant Senate Majority Leader Don Nickles, a Republican from Oklahoma. NOVAK: Good evening. Welcome to CROSSFIRE. They're dancing the election-year tax-cut minuet on Capitol Hill. The Republican Congress passes a tax cut, the Democratic president vetoes it. Tom what avail? It's presidential politics, stupid! Last week, the Senate voted to repeal gradually the 84-year-old law that heavily taxes estates, and therefore, limits what can be left to heirs there. There will be a certain veto. And as we sit here, the Senate is readying itself to pass a bill to reduce taxes on working married couples. It, too, faces a sure veto unless the Republicans buy a deal offered by the president.

Bush, who is playing catch-up to John McCain in New Hampshire, has picked up a couple of key endorsements, just ahead of next Tuesday's state primary. CNN's Carol Lin is in Manchester with all the latest political news for us. Good morning to you, Carol. CAROL LIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Miles. Before we get to that endorsement, we just want to let you know, and a reminder here, just three days left before the New Hampshire voters go to the polls. And we want to share the latest polling figures with you. The numbers are starting to change. The latest CNN tracking poll shows a virtual dead heat for the front-runners in the Republican race. George W. Bush is now the choice of 37 percent of likely voters, with John McCain at 36 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent. For the Democrats, Vice President Al Gore continues to lead Bill Bradley, 56 percent to 40 percent. Bill Bradley's campaign bank account is up to $20 million, almost double that of Al Gore's. Campaign finances were a topic of discussion at a Democratic Party fund raiser that both Gore and Bradley attended. And CNN's John King was there as well. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN KING, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was an overwhelmingly Al Gore crowd at Friday night's New Hampshire Democratic Party dinner. But rival Bill Bradley nonetheless warned the vice president's role in 1996 fund-raising controversies would make him an easy general election target. BILL BRADLEY (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we don't clean our house, the Republicans will clean it for us in the fall. KING: It was another example of Bradley's more aggressive posture in the final weekend before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, his call for campaign finance reform mixed in with condemnation of Gore's role in 1996 fund-raising abuses. BRADLEY: They were disgraceful for both Republicans and Democrats. But they were most embarrassing for Democrats, because we're the party of the little guy. KING: Gore spoke first, and he compared the economic distress of New Hampshire seven years ago with the boom times now. ALBERT A. GORE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today's prosperity, which I've talked about here this evening, did not happen by accident. It happened because you were willing to fight for a set of policies that were extremely controversial when they were enacted. KING: The vice president said Bradley's plan for universal health care coverage would spend too much of the federal budget surplus on one program, and Gore suggested he would be the more vigorous Democratic candidate in the fall campaign. GORE: Make no mistake about the passion that will be needed for the fight that lies ahead. Make no underestimate of the forces of resistance that are out there, hungry to take back the White House.

He said that he wanted to deliver that news to Leader Pelosi and when he delivered the news to me and to Leader Pelosi he did talk about the fact that it is important now to go back to the issues and the challenges that this country faces. KING: He initially rejected calls from Leader Pelosi from yourself and from other Democrats and a pretty good nudge from the president of the United States that was not directly a call for his resignation. What changed his mind? ISRAEL: I can't tell you what changed his mind. I can't tell you that he was very concerned in all the conversations that I had with him with the fact that this had become a huge distraction. And repeatedly we talked about the fact that the Republicans introduced a bill to privatize Social Security and we weren't able to talk about that bill to privatize Social Security because there was so much attention given to Congressman Weiner. Now we can pay attention to the privatization of Social Security and fight to stop it. KING: And let me ask you, you used the word ""huge distraction"". Certainly a huge distraction to the Democrats in trying to advance their agenda here in Washington, D.C. Your job is to try to win enough seats next year to get that speaker's gavel away from John Boehner and to give it back to Leader Pelosi, if that is the Democratic Conference's choice. When you're out recruiting candidates, when you're out talking, trying to raise money over the past couple of weeks, how many times has the Weiner sexting scandal come up as an obstacle to you doing that work? ISRAEL: You know on the fundamentals of recruiting candidates, and the other things that we do, it wasn't really that much of a distraction but on the retail level, the fact of the matter is that Congressman Weiner himself realized that his story had become a distraction from the fact that the Republicans tried to privatize Social Security. And when Republicans introduce a bill to privatize Social Security and people aren't paying attention that becomes an untenable situation. Not politically but untenable for the country. And that is what I think helped bring him to the decision that he should resign so we can get back to those fundamentally important issues and challenges. KING: I'm getting an example here of why you're the chairman of the Congressional Campaign Committee. I could ask you the color of the sky and you get back to the Republican plan on Social Security and I completely -- I understand that's your job. Help me understand the evolution of this.

You know, you can have all of the activity around registering voters, celebrities, organizing them online, but if you don't have a candidate whose message connects with this generation, then it's not going to as impactful. And so, Barack actually targeting young people and setting up an unprecedented field operation, that's what did it for them. And I think, as we saw, Senator Clinton, get off the plane in New Hampshire and say that young voters are her campaign now and she's going to correct those mistakes.

Matt, let me ask you, do you think the momentum, what we saw in Iowa, will continue over right there into New Hampshire? APPENFELLER: Absolutely. Nationwide we are one of the most engaged and active demographics and we will come out in New Hampshire the same way. PHILLIPS: And why is that? Why is it such an engaged demographic right now? APPENFELLER: You know what, I think we realize that we have a stake in the future. I think that what's coming up in the next election is really going to have a big impact on how our lives are going to be in the next couple of years. And we have a little bit of ownership in our society and the way that we practice that, the way we exercise that is by coming out to vote.

They took her over the border into Spain. Now, here`s another little connection that they`ve discovered. A woman -- there were reports of a woman who looked like Victoria Beckham in Barcelona, Spain.

40128,43789,CNN,Special Event,"this convention by acclamation. (END VIDEO CLIP) GREENFIELD (voice-over): President Truman clearly paved the way for Adlai Stevenson in 1952. His public endorsement in the middle of the first ballot was the key to Stevenson's nomination. But that year, nothing was going to stop General Eisenhower from winning. Eight years later, Eisenhower, endorsed Richard Nixon as his successor. But when Ike was asked if he could name an important Nixon achievement as vice president, he answered, probably sarcastically, ""If you give me a week, I might think of one."" For his part, Nixon delayed until the very end bringing Ike out to campaign for him, a delay that might have cost him the election. In 1968, President Johnson never even showed up at the tumultuous Chicago convention that nominated his successor, Hubert Humphrey. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 1968) HUBERT HUMPHREY (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I proudly accept nomination of our party. (END VIDEO CLIP) GREENFIELD: The divisions over the war in Vietnam, the violence in the streets, the assassinations, and his own refusal to run again had made him a huge liability. Indeed, it wasn't until Humphrey broke with Johnson over the war that he began to close the gap and almost caught Nixon at the wire. Indeed, the only successful post-war transfer of power within a party was when Ronald Reagan passed the torch to George Bush in 1988. What did he say? First, he gently ridiculed the Democratic criticism of his record. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 1988) RONALD REAGAN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When our friends last month talked of unemployment, despair, hopelessness, economic weakness, I wondered why on earth they were talking about 1978 instead of 1988. (END VIDEO CLIP) GREENFIELD: Next, he laid his blessing on Bush. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 1988) REAGAN: With George Bush, I'll know, as we approach the new millennium, our children will have a future secure with a nation at peace and protected against aggression. (END VIDEO CLIP) GREENFIELD: And finally, he claimed the mantle of the future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 1988) REAGAN: Now we hear talk that it's time for a change. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are the change. (END VIDEO CLIP) GREENFIELD: And he did it with a certain sense of humor.

(INAUDIBLE) this new thing with John Avlon where he crunches the numbers, the ""Power Rankings"" tonight. And then a Baptist church in Pikeville, Kentucky votes to ban interracial marriage. Stella Harville (ph), a woman denied permission to marry comes OUTFRONT with her story for the first time. And the ""Bottom Line"" on the president, unemployment the lowest it's been in about three years, but there's -- there's a real big but -- does he need Bill Clinton to win? Let's go OUTFRONT. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight unemployment drops to 8.6 percent. That is the lowest level for unemployment in about three years. Now it's a big psychological headline, but a closer look, 120,000 jobs added last month really isn't great. Frankly that is barely enough to keep up with population growth, never mind put a dent in the nearly nine million jobs lost in the great recession. Still, the president hopes that America will focus on the unemployment rate. And he's also hoping he can get some of what this guy has. Oh, that Bill. He has the love. He has the love of so many voters. Recently some Republicans have said Bill Clinton isn't sold on Barack Obama term two. But the two men appeared together at a Green Building (ph) event in Washington today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am thrilled that President Clinton has been willing to take this on. As he pointed out, partly thanks to me he's home alone too often. And this has been a passion for him for quite some time, so I am very grateful for his involvement. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT: President Obama needs all the Bill he can get. Bill Clinton's book ""Back to Work"", example number one of the former president's popularity; it's the number one political book on Amazon. Number 10 on ""The New York Times"" bestseller list and Clinton's latest approval rating is at a sky high 63 percent. Can you just imagine if that were the margin in an election of the vote. Now that's a mandate. All right, compare that to Obama's nearly 20 points lower at 44 percent. OK. Bill, he needs you. But are you going to be there for him? James Carville is former adviser to Bill Clinton. David Gergen is another former adviser to Clinton and our senior political analyst and John Avlon is with us as well. All right, James Carville, what is going on here? You see Bill Clinton with Barack Obama. But you know this is at a Green Building (ph). It's a cause of the former president's.

And, Anderson Cooper, as we get ready for what will be a very personal, personal statement from Michelle Obama, we have seen some excerpts already. And she gets very personal speaking about her life. And we hear about her husband's life. She will be introduced by her brother, Craig Robinson. That will be an emotional moment, as well, by all accounts. I want to get back to this notion that James Carville and David Gergen were -- were saying, that the Democrats, except for the beautiful tribute to Ted Kennedy, have, effectively, they say, wasted this first night of this Democratic Convention. COOPER: We should also point out we're going to be going without commercial interruption all the way through Michelle Obama's speech, which is going to take place any moment now.

There would be no need to protest. It is not our end goal, nor is it our desire to be protesting for the rest of our lives, as our ends. CABRERA: Do you appreciate these police officers who are not the bad apples, those are the few, right, and the large majority of police officers in America have good intentions? MARIE: So it's not about the individual police officers. It is about the systemic oppression, the systemic in justice of policing in this country. So we need to really change that narrative. Because we continue to be asked about the good police officers, and when we see almost 1,100 people killed last year by police officers, then we have to asked, few bad apples, when we're in July of the year, midway through the year, and we see over 550 people have been shot and killed this year by police officers. And those are the numbers that are reported, that are killed, not just the shootings, then we have to ask, does that sound look a few? That doesn't sound like one, two, three or four to me. It sounds like a larger problem. We know that there is a larger systemic problem. I say you know, when we don't want this to be the end to what we're out here doing in the streets.

How Donald Trump's time in office actually changed what the U.S. was getting to when it comes to these climate goals? That's a big one as well. But I do think that what you're seeing is a very different policy here with the Biden Administration, of course, but the question of world leaders have is how long that last does? KING: Kaitlan Collins at the White House. And let's take that question and carry it over to our scientists with us here on Earth Day, Rob Jackson.

How much of a difference does that make that if we were having this conversation six months ago? ROB JACKSON, EARTH SCIENTIST, STANFORD UNIVERSITY: Well, it makes a huge difference. We're seeing climate become a priority. And I think there are good reasons to promote climate action beyond climate itself we are not creating jobs in the future. We've already created millions of jobs in clean tech and clean energy, far more than we've lost in industries such as coal. So there are benefits right now for jobs and health and national security. So I'm excited. Happy Earth Day, by the way. KING: Happy Earth Day. You say you're excited; I want to walk through some of this. First, I just want to show on the screen, why American leadership is so important. American leadership is important not all issues but if you look at the global greenhouse gas emitter so the United States has a fair share of it in the teens there.

You are the head of the Francophone and French department at UCLA and you are here in Berlin. You are an expert, a specialist on E.U. affairs. What impact is this going to have on Merkel? We are already seeing the CSU head, the sister party in Bavaria, saying we have to look again at this refugee policy. DOMINIC THOMAS, CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF FRENCH & FRANCOPHONE STUDIES, UCLA: For the past few months, Chancellor Merkel has been under pressure to acknowledge that her initial response to the refugee crisis, migrant crisis back in 2015 came out of a level of unpreparedness. She has had to backtrack on some of those initial policies by explaining to members of the party and to German society that she would like to do this a little bit differently, to have stricter regulations in place. Now the debate has shifted completely. Because 2017 is the general elections. We all know the far-right political parties, particularly the Alternative for Germany that has been demonstrating the last few days. (CROSSTALK) BURNS: Last night, right outside of her chancellery. THOMAS: Right. And right outside the Brandenburg Gate where the German flag was beamed onto it, much of the way the French flag was beamed on the this building after the Nice attack last summer. These questions are important. And within her party she is facing increasing pressure and within the coalition to speak out on these kinds of questions. BURNS: We saw yesterday that Merkel's cabinet approved two measures, one requiring -- that would require the veil, or the face -- I'm sorry. That would ban the face covering -- THOMAS: Right. BURNS: -- among public employees, and also allowing video surveillance in places like these in the square. THOMAS: Right. BURNS: How much of that do you think will help to address the issue? THOMAS: I think, on one hand, the German society is divided about these responses. Many people have spoken out saying they don't want a state of surveillance, as imposed in France, this state of emergency that is perpetually renewed in the face of the 2015 attacks. BURNS: The Pirate Party is strong, here, too. And they are against intrusion of privacy. THOMAS: Right. That sort of aspect is defining it. But the bigger question of talking about and linking terrorism to refugees and asylum seekers is proving incredibly helpful to far-right parties that are working on this fear and anxiety around these questions.

This latest announcement from Iran has provoked the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to say -- to repeat that threat. And the threat has no particular power behind it, in terms of they haven't revealed what they would do if they were to get to the stage when they decided that Iran was nuclear capable. But it is the absolute horror story for the Jewish state and it's a strategic nightmare for the region. It is perhaps for that reason that Saudi Arabia and Qatar have begun to put aside their very acrimonious differences and the Qataris will, for the first time in several years, be attending the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting in Saudi Arabia today after the Saudis ended or agreed to open their borders, both in air, on land and at sea to the Qataris. Of course those two nations both looking across the Arabian Gulf, the Persian Gulf, toward Iran and very, very anxious about these regional tensions that periodically ratchet up and down as a consequence largely of the United States' withdrawal, as you mentioned there, John, from the JCPOA, the nuclear deal, that was supposed to get the Iranians to set aside their nuclear program in return for lifting of sanctions. Since the Trump administration left that and went for a campaign of maximum pressure, we have seen an increase in tensions. And, as you rightly point out, this is pretty close to the anniversary of the killing of Soleimani, General Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, who was responsible for what the Americans, Israelis and others would describe as Iran's destabilizing operations in the region, in particular, Syria and Iraq but also, of course, in Yemen. So none of those tensions have gone down through the Trump administration. There is a sense here that everybody is just holding their breath until the Biden administration can get back into power and perhaps de-escalate and return to real diplomacy.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is giving mixed messages as he tries to explain his claim that President Obama founded ISIS. Despite repeatedly using the attack line against the president over the last two days, he later tweeted that it was clearly sarcasm. Then he went to say today that it was -- quote -- ""not that sarcastic."" Tonight, Trump's poll numbers are falling with new surveys showing him trailing Hillary Clinton in the critical battleground states of Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, and Colorado. Fearing fallout from a Trump loss, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is now saying that the chances of Republicans keeping control of the Senate are ""very dicey."" Clinton also upping the pressure on Trump to release his tax returns, making her most recent filing public today. In response, the Trump campaign has just a released statement of accusing Clinton of hiding and deleting the only records that he says what people want to see. We're covering all of that and many more things with our guests, including Trump supporter and Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge. Our correspondents and expert analyst are also standing by. But let's begin with the Trump campaign. CNN's Jim Acosta is in Erie, Pennsylvania, where Trump held a rally earlier today. Jim, it looks like all these controversies taking a toll in those polls. JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Jim. It's getting hard to tell whether or not Donald Trump is joking when he says President Obama is the founder of IS. But what's not a laughing matter is the state of the Trump campaign if you look at the latest poll numbers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ACOSTA (voice-over): Have you heard one about the presidential candidate who called President Obama the founder of ISIS? DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So, I said the founder of ISIS. Obviously, I'm being sarcastic. Then -- then -- but not that sarcastic, to be honest with you.

And that was the late Senator John McCain. I know you were very close to Senator McCain both professionally and personally. You were even in his wedding. This type of criticism is not unheard of from this president. COHEN: It's one of the reasons why I felt I could never vote for President Trump or Trump as president because of what he said about John McCain, he's not a hero because he was shot down, he was captured? What message does that say to all of the young brave men and women who go and their families who go into the service for our country and willing to shed blood, leave their bodies on the battlefield and say if you get caught, you're really not much of a hero. If you get shot, well, you know you're pretty incompetent. John McCain suffered for five and a half years. He was tortured almost daily. And when the time came they tried to make a deal with him because they were getting bombarded by the fleet that was commanded by his father. McCain said I don't make those kinds of deal. So, I don't make a deal just to say I have a deal and walk out of here ahead of my time. And so, he stayed longer, took more punishment, took more beatings so he could walk out with his head held high that he didn't compromise his fellow POWs. And by the way, with John McCain's leadership, he helped keep some of those POWs alive. His fellow colleagues who were locked in there, they stayed alive because of his spirit and the way he lifted their morale and said we're going to get through this. So, yes, I look at that and say that's not a commander in chief that I respect. He's not a commander in chief who believes in truthfulness, who believes in openness, who believes in shedding light on a particular subject but simply what he does is he pardons his friends and he punishes his enemies. And I want a president who again stands for honesty and honor for truthfulness and for the integrity this country really represents to the world. And when I travel around the world, I find many people, many leaders looking to me saying what has happened to your country? How did you ever descend from where you've been to where you are now in terms of having a leader who represents all of the characteristics that we like to see in the president of the most powerful nation in the world? And so, they are astonished. They are no longer in awe of us. They no longer admire us to the same degree. And they are hoping that there will be a change in the future, as am I. ACOSTA: All right.

Underway right now, the White House holding a press briefing that you're not allowed to see. Yes, for some reason, they have banned live, on camera coverage of Press Secretary Sean Spicer answering questions from journalists, day two in a row here. We will take the audio just moments from now. So stand by for that. First, let's begin with this incredible reporting out of ""The Washington Post"" this morning that brings a whole new level of intrigue to these images you are seeing. ""The Washington Post"" just chronicle the at times super secretive and strained play by play that led to former President Obama confronting Vladimir Putin in 2016 about Russia hacking the presidential election. Here is what President Obama said about this. This was in December, his final month in the Oval Office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (December 29, 2016): In early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be some serious consequences if he didn't. And in fact - (END VIDEO CLIP) BALDWIN: ""The Washington Post"" learned one of the possible consequences is the U.S. releasing these digital bombs that could be actually inserted into Russian networks. And ""The Post"" followed what happened in the month after these two leaders met, specifically how the Obama White House decided to strike back against Russia's meddling with sanctions and expulsions, an effort that elicited this quote from a senior Obama official who told ""The Washington Post,"" quote, ""it is the hardest thing about my entire time in government to defend. I feel like we sort of choked."" Let's talk about all of this with someone who was in the Obama White House at the time and a former top intelligence official. CNN military and diplomatic retired Rear Admiral John Kirby used to serve as spokesman not only at the State Department but the Pentagon as well during that administration. So, as always, admiral, nice to have you on. James Woolsey's with us. He was CIA director under the Clinton administration and was a senior adviser on the Trump campaign. So, gentlemen, welcome. And, Admiral Kirby, I mean to that - to that Obama administration official quote on how he or she felt like they choked, do you agree that the Obama administration choked? REAR ADMIRAL JOHN KIRBY (RET.), CNN MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC ANALYST: Well, look, to be honest right out of the gate there, Brooke, I wasn't party to these conversations at the time, so I wasn't in the room when these decisions were getting made.

A very disappointing game with no feeling from the players. VERJEE: On this edition of Q&A;, top class teams making it and breaking it at the World Cup. (END VIDEO CLIP) VERJEE: Welcome to Q&A.; In any tournament, there are winners and there are losers. At the football World Cup, underway in South Korea and Japan, it's no different. What has been surprising, though, is who have been the victors and who have been the vanquished so far. Earlier, I spoke with CNN's Tim Lister in Seoul, and I started by asking him which teams playing on Monday made it through to the quarter- finals. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TIM LISTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Two more teams joined the list of quarter finalists today. Brazil beat Belgium in short order, by two goals to 0, the goals coming from Reynaldo and Evaldo. And in the other game, the United States, also 2-0 victors over Mexico. More of a surprise, that one, because the Mexicans have been playing particularly well, their goals coming from McBride and in the second-half, 20-year-old Landon Donovan. So the United States goes forward to meet Germany in the next round. Now, earlier on in this cup of upsets, I spoke to FIFA's director of media, Keith Cooper. I asked him why so many surprises in this World Cup. KEITH COOPER, FIFA: The game has become so cosmopolitan for so many South Americans -- Africans in particular, and now increasingly Asians -- playing in European leagues. They know each other that much better, and it's that much more difficult to get one up over your rivals. And the world of television, where everybody knows what's going on in other countries as well -- there are no secrets any more. And teams that prepare well for competition like this are always going to stand a chance. LISTER: How do you expect the rest of the tournament to go now? Or is it impossible to gauge? COOPER: This is the most (UNINTELLIGIBLE) stage of any football tournament as I've ever come across. Nothing is going to form -- or very little is going to form. And I think right from the word go, right from that opening match, all the others teams said, Hey, wait a minute. We're playing here on neutral territory. None of us have been here before.

One of those options killed in a separate attack near the Capitol in the days after the insurrection. The House is now adjourned. CNN is told that as the Speaker spoke, the only Republicans in the Chamber were Liz Cheney, who was a member of the Select Committee investigating the insurrection and her father, the Former Vice President of the United States, Dick Cheney, who was a member of the House Republican leadership back in the day. BASH: Yes. And as you were speaking, you couldn't see because you're looking at the camera. The House Speaker came off the dais as and came down into the well to greet Liz Cheney and her father, Dick Cheney; you could see how kind of empty it was. But the fact that she came down onto the floor and made a point of greeting him, and more importantly, the fact that he made it a point of being there as a symbol to stand with his daughter, but also stand with the rule of law and the Republican Party that he thinks. I mean, he was certainly not - he was certainly a controversial guy, but he believes in the basics of the Constitution and obviously wanted to stand by his daughter. KING: Again, the fraud of the America first Trump, part of this is that that is putting America first you don't have to agree with Dick Cheney, or you don't have to agree with Nancy Pelosi, maybe you're somewhere in the middle to think that this is a day.

All the recordings he has done going into ""The Apprentice,"" other things, there could be a tape somewhere. So, perhaps that's what she was thinking when she said, I can't guarantee it. But she certainly was not definitive at all. And in many other times, she has been. So, it was curious, at least, in that regard. COOPER: Jeff, the White House still saying the president's description of Manigault Newman as a dog is much ado about nothing? ZELENY: They are indeed. You heard Sarah Sanders say it there. He is happy to insult anyone. He is happy to insult anyone of any race who he doesn't agree with. She said the president believes that she lacks integrity. Keep in mind, of course, he hired her. He brought her on here in the first place. He's been a long-time friend of hers. But reality is the White House repeatedly said it's not racist. You know, only the president knows what's in his heart when he said that. He has called numerous people dogs repeatedly. There is a long list of former rivals, dogs, other things. But never as a sitting president has he called a former staffer, certainly a former African-American high ranking staffer here a dog. That's what he called Omarosa, of course, this morning. COOPER: And I understand that Manigault Newman is claiming that she was interviewed special counsel Robert Mueller. Do we know if that's even true? ZELENY: We have her word on that, and that's the only word because the special counsel, of course, is the only person in this town who has not commented on this case. But we do know at least talking to White House officials here that while she was at least at the White House, she was not interviewed, she was not asked to sit down with him. But, of course, she was fired last December. So, she writes in her book that she was contacted by the FBI in February of 2018. So, after that, if she sat down with him, that, of course, is something that she would have a record of and have an understanding of. It's hard to understand she would lie about that specifically when it's so verifiable. But, of course, the special counsel's office never comments on who they interview. So, it is her word at this point. But, Anderson, so much of this simply is her word. Of course, a lot of unverified claims in there. COOPER: Yes. ZELENY: But a lot of claims on tape as well, Anderson. COOPER: Jeff Zeleny, thanks very much. I want to talk about one of the tapes.

45376,49440,CNN,Talkback Live,"ask you if what happened here really reflects the pressure that is put on the candidates to get their message out and what happens when things, perhaps under that pressure, things fall between the cracks? PAUL BEGALA, CO-HOST, MSNBC ""EQUAL TIME"": Well, not only the pressure to get the message out. Bush has plenty of money; he's got enough time to do that. But the pressure, frankly, to win. Don't forget this is a campaign, the Bush campaign, which comes to this with a history. In the beginning of this year, in the New York primary, the Bush campaign ran an ad attacking John McCain that falsely accused McCain of opposing breast cancer research. So when Bush falls behind, he gets very desperate, he feels the pressure to win. And his past history has been that sometimes he'll go across the line and do really sleazy things, much worse than this ad, frankly. What he did to John McCain was truly vicious and very ruthless, and there's still a lot of hard feelings, I suspect, in the McCain camp. This is a much smaller, frankly, slur. But it's puzzling to me, though. Why would you go and call people RATS in a political campaign? I'm sure they think we're RATS, but it's not exactly the kind of discourse from the man who lectures us piously about how he's going to change the tone of politics. COSSACK: Paul, we have had experts in editing and people who make commercials come on and say that, you know, in their opinion, this was something that, while probably intentional, certainly was not intended to be a big thing. Do you see this as that kind of activity, that was it intentional and it was intended to get across a really negative message by putting the word RATS in there? BEGALA: Oh, sure. They didn't mean it as a big wet kiss for the Democrats, you know. I'm a little conflicted in that I know these guys... COSSACK: But what does a word -- but Paul, what does the word ""RATS"" mean? I mean... BEGALA: I think it's -- it means vermin. It's a destructive rodent, it's a disgusting creature. And I, frankly, look, Roger, this is how they think about Democrats. They don't say...

Why not just say they have their ideas on Social Security, we have ours, let's have a fair fight about issues? The truth is they go to this politics of personal destruction. They did it against Clinton in '92 and '96. They did it against Democrats in '98. It always fails but they always do it. COSSACK: All right. All right, Paul, let me get Vin back in here.

Perhaps nothing fires up conservatives more than a Supreme Court vacancy. Justice Kennedy delivered the bombshell news himself, carrying his retirement letter with him as he visited the White House, only hours after the court finished its business for the term.

Democrats tried retaliating by mounting a filibuster of Trump's first nominee to the court, Justice Neil Gorsuch, but it backfired and prompted McConnell to change the rules of the Senate, which means the next nominee needs only 51 votes to be confirmed. Trump often says putting Gorsuch on the court is his biggest achievement since taking office. TRUMP: I have always felt that, after the defense of our nation, the most important decision a president of the United States can make is the appointment of a Supreme Court justice. Depending on their age, a justice can be active for 50 years, and his or her decisions can last a century or more and can often be permanent. (END VIDEOTAPE) ZELENY: And that is one of the central reason, the permanent nature of the Supreme Court post and the possibility of appointing a young nominee like Neil Gorsuch is why Senate Democrats are urging a delay on this, Wolf. Senator Chuck Schumer calls this a once-in-a-generation, at least, decision. He is calling for this to be a vote to be held after the mid-term elections.

Meantime, CNN's Miguel Marquez is covering the transition already in the state capital of Sacramento. And Miguel, after just listening to the state controller, Steve Westly, it sounds like they've got their work cut out for them. MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Oh, a lot of work, I'd say. As we know, campaigns are all about promises. And governing is all about reality. The two sides seem to be talking nice for the most part right now. But it seems they're both due for a big reality check. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARQUEZ (voice-over): One side called it a fix for a state and a governor gone bad. SCHWARZENEGGER: Davis always knows how to run a dirty campaign. But he doesn't know how to run the state. MARQUEZ: The other side called it a circus and a right-wing conspiracy. DAVIS: We will send a message from California to Crawford, Texas, to the White House, we are not going to stand for a Republican power grab. MARQUEZ: But in the end, both sides called for unity, even if their foot soldiers didn't believe it. SCHWARZENEGGER: Gracious phone call from Governor Davis, OK? I really appreciated that call because he promised me that he would work hard to make this transition smooth. DAVIS: We've had a lot of good nights over the last 20 years. But tonight the people did decide it is time for someone else to serve. And I accept their judgment. I have placed a call to Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger just.... (BOOING) DAVIS: ... placed a call to Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger just a few minutes ago to congratulate him on being elected governor. MARQUEZ: Among the also-rans, Tom McClintock, the conservative state senator. He conceded by calling his campaign the conscience of the election, but is now ready to cooperate with his new political boss. MCCLINTOCK: I have just spoken to Governor-Elect Arnold Schwarzenegger, and pledged to him my whole hearted support in undertaking the great responsibilities which the people have entrusted him with. This is a great day for California. MARQUEZ: But Cruz Bustamante, who will remain lieutenant governor, and had little to do under Davis, isn't warming up to his new boss too quickly. BUSTAMANTE: Go where you like, feel free to stay as long as you like, I'll be here keeping an eye on things. MARQUEZ: So will those talking about unity walk in unison? They may have little choice for now because of a lightning-fast transition. Candidates usually have about 60 days, but this time Schwarzenegger may only have a little more than a month.

CAROL LIN, CNN ANCHOR: Well, all this week we've been looking at different sources of power. We've looked at water power and wind power and today, we're going to look at nuclear power. COLLEEN MCEDWARDS, CNN ANCHOR: That's right. It's controversial, of course. You remember the Three Mile Island accident, Chernobyl, but energy officials are now giving it another look. CNN's Elaine Quijano is at a nuclear power plant in Maryland for us this morning -- Elaine. ELAINE QUIJANO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Colleen and Carol, I'm at the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, about an hour and a half southeast of Washington. This is one of about a hundred nuclear power plants across the country and together, these types of plants help generate about one-fifth of the nation's electricity. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) QUIJANO (voice-over): Inside these twin towers sit the source of power for half a million Maryland residents. Two nuclear reactors, each housed in containment units with four-foot thick concrete walls, together, these reactors at the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant supply 20 percent of Maryland's electricity. STEVE UNGLESBEE, CONSTELLATION ENERGY GROUP: We use uranium fuel which is heated in a reactor vessel -- a thick steel vessel. It turns water to steam, steam in turn turns a turbine, which in turn turns a generator to produce electricity. QUIJANO: The cooling system for the reactors includes 12 pumps that draw in 200,000 gallons of water every minute from the Chesapeake Bay. Plant officials say this water never flows through the reactor itself and is, therefore, not radioactive. The water is then returned to the bay creating a continuous intake and outflow. At Calvert Cliffs, officials say the water that comes out is only one or two degrees warmer than its original temperature. At the turbine building, two sets of generators crank out power, then power lines carry the electricity to local customers. Officials say it's a system that's worked well at the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Plant for the last three decades. UNGLESBEE: We used those decades to improve our safety levels to world class levels, to improve our performance, to improve our good economics. QUIJANO: Still, critics of nuclear power say there are better alternative sources of energy. (END VIDEOTAPE) QUIJANO: And those alternatives include solar and wind power. But officials here argue that nuclear energy is the most efficient in their opinion. They say that one nuclear fuel pellet, about this size, generates as much energy as an entire ton of coal.

CLARK: Well, you know, again, I'm not going to second-guess them, but I have to tell you, if you start getting a search warrant for a property, which means that you have probable cause, then you've got to be very close to saying that this person is a suspect. If we're still in the elimination process, if Scott is not at all being suspected in this, then why do you need a search warrant? I'm sure consent would be appropriate there, but that's not what we're seeing, so you've got to be talking very close to being a suspect. HARRIS: Finally here, do you think they may be moving toward an arrest anytime soon, do you think an arrest is imminent? What do your instincts here as an officer tells you? CLARK: I wouldn't say that arrest is imminent, because it takes a large degree of probable cause to go ahead and make this arrest, and oftentimes, law enforcement officials are looking for that link in that search to make that leap from just being a suspect to being an arrest, so I could not at all say it's imminent. Based on the way they seem to be handling him at this point, it doesn't appear that something has been found to say, we can make that jump to an arrest situation.

But today it's a day where the politicians take the lead. Prime Minister Najib Miqati meeting with outgoing prime minister, Saad Hariri, trying to negotiate a political deal. Hariri's bloc still saying that they won't work with this new prime minister. And it's in the vacuum while he's trying to do that. It could take days, months, perhaps even longer for him to form that government and the scenes of violence that were witnessed here on Tuesday, that they could return. And that's why the army is just off to the side here, waiting to see what happens. (END VIDEO TAPE) ANDERSON: Afghan President Hamid Karzai swore in his nation's new government today, ending a week long stand-off sparked by last year's controversial elections. Mr. Karzai wanted to delay opening parliament so that a special court that he had established could investigate claims of election fraud. Well, critics deemed the court unconstitutional and wanted it scrapped. Eventually, both sides reached a deal allowing prosecution of election-based criminal cases based on existing laws with no references to the special court.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOB COSTAS, NBC SPORTS BROADCASTER: The first time I met and spoke with him when he was 18 years-old, I was struck by how broad his view of things was, but sports is one of the very few avenues in life where people peak in terms of their ability long before most of us reach any sort of emotional maturity. You were a veteran when you're 27, 28 years old. Whatever happened is relatively meaningless between Kobe and Shaq, some kind of a spat with athletic ego's involve and all the rest that they've long since have reconciled. They're young guys.

So, what's been achieved so far as this climate summit enters its second and final week and what are your expectations once it ends on November 12th? MASLIN: So, the first thing is we've had three big announcements in the first week, which has been really encouraging. The first one is the one to end deforestation completely by 2030, which was signed by most of the major nations of the world. We've had two big coal announcements. One, on stopping funding of new coal and also countries pledging to actually phase out coal, which is really good. And then also the big one, which was the 30% reduction in methane emissions, which is a very powerful greenhouse gas, by 2030. And the interesting thing is if you put all of those together and the countries actually deliver all the things they've promised, we could already keep the temperature to 1.8 or 1.9 degrees above preindustrial times.

Powell was named military assistant to the Secretary of Defense, and was exposed to decision making at the highest levels. POWELL: At some point in my career, I realized I was doing well enough to become a general. KOPPEL: So Colin Powell left Washington for an assignment at Fort Carson, Colorado, one that would put him within reach of that once unthinkable goal, but the newly minted general would not stay away from the capitol for long. CARUCCI: He didn't want to come back, but we had Ronald Reagan call him and he agreed to come back. KOPPEL: It was an offer he couldn't refuse, Deputy National Security Adviser. He was later promoted to National Security Adviser, a first for an African-American. When George Bush became President, he kept Powell close by, naming him to the highest military rank in the country, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Powell exploded onto the scene in August 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Powell was initially reluctant to commit U.S. troops, but eventually he became one of the administrations most trusted spokesmen, when the assault on Saddam Hussein's army finally came. POWELL: Our strategy to go after this army is very, very simple. First, we're going to cut it off and then we're going to kill it. KOPPEL: When the war was over, Powell had become a national hero. Powell's term extended into the Clinton Administration where he again argued against military action. This time in Bosnia. Even though ethnic cleansing reached gruesome proportions, the mission did not fit the parameters of the Powell Doctrine. POWELL: I have been characterized as the reluctant warrior. Guilty. But I follow in a long tradition of American generals who have always been reluctant warriors. KOPPEL: In 1993, Powell retired to write his memoirs with a reported $6 million advance. Published in late '95, the promotional tour was mobbed. POWELL: I'll take a question. SAM DONALDSON, CORRESPONDENT: General, is this really the start of a book tour, or the start of a presidential campaign? POWELL: Today is the beginning of a book tour, Mr. Donaldson, and...

I have never once heard any member of our court say something slighting or denigrating of another justice, not even as a joke. In that room, we are professional. We state our views. We listen to the others. And the key to that conference is, people are saying what they really think. They're not trying to create an impression. And everybody writes down what everybody else says, and there's some discussion. And it works, because we all respect each other as individuals, even -- and we like each other as individuals, no matter how much we disagree, and we do disagree on many very important issues. PHILLIPS: There were no arguments, expletives, even when deciding the election? BREYER: No. Personal, no. It's professional. And it's polite. Because what good would it do? I mean, you know, being practical, suppose I got angry and I said, You know, this is really important. KING: Well, you're wrong. BREYER: Yes, you would say, Well, I think it's important too, you know. And I think my position is right. That gets us nowhere. What gets people somewhere is listening to what the other person says, seeing where he or she is coming from, trying to reply in terms that the person who said whatever he said or she said will appreciate the response in terms of where they're -- where they are, not where I am.

But I can tell you that, if you get out of the helicopter and jump near the crater, if you happen to be hiking -- and you can -- that's what is amazing. You can hike on these craters when the volcano is not erupting. And if you happen to be up there when it would be erupting, then it would obviously be an inferno. But, from where we were, we did not feel the heat. COOPER: And when you were on the ground, how far could you see actually through this cloud? TUCHMAN: Well, that is what was amazing. I mean, we were literally -- it was a beautiful day by Iceland standards, very cold, but very sunny. And you saw like a gray curtain in front of us. We started driving. We drove into the gray curtain, and then you couldn't see anything. You know what it reminded me of, Anderson. It reminded me of a solar eclipse. I haven't been in a solar eclipse, but it reminded me of the pictures. It just was completely dark. But the ash just kept falling like a heavy rain, and got in our hair, and got in your eyes. And, of course, you had to wear those masks. We obviously don't know the health effects of this, this continuous ash that falls on the ground. So, you had to wear the mask. But it was just like being in the fun house. That's the best way to describe it to you. COOPER: Gary Tuchman on the ground -- Gary, thanks very much. Stay safe. Keep wearing that mask. Let's take a closer look at the new developments with Chad Myers. Chad, how big is this thing? Where is it headed? CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: This is a 15,000 high ash cloud. Now, the first one, the first eruption or explosion was 40,000 feet high. So, that ash actually got into the jet stream and blew around in different directions. This lower level, even though it's three miles, we will still call this lower-level ash, will be picked up by lower-level winds and also the surface winds. And those winds are blowing right toward the U.K. So, even though other countries are opening airspace, so to speak, the airspace that they're opening is above 35,000 feet, because that ash that was very high has either blown away or settled out. So, the air above 30,000 feet is clean, clean enough for planes to go through. The problem is getting to that 30,000-foot level, because you have to start from the ground, and you can't fly through the dirty layer at 10,000 to 15,000 feet.

But we will be able to defeat them if we drive home the point that that betrayal of this nation's moral heart wasn't the result of Bill Clinton's foibles. It's the result of the fact that the Democrats... WOODRUFF: Time. KEYES: ... have betrayed the basic moral principles of this nation's life. WOODRUFF: Mr. Keyes, if a president matters, and I assume that you believe he does, why did all of these indices go down during a Democratic administration, albeit not enough, while they went up during previous Republican administrations? KEYES: Well, you make a wrong assumption. I don't think the president does matter that much. I am running for the office of president not because I think his power matters, but because I think the abuses of power that have undermined the position of Americans: control of money, control of schools, control of their lives. It is the American people that have produced this booming economy. It is people who have come to their senses and started in their churches, and neighborhoods, and schools pushing abstinence programs and marriage counseling. They're the ones who have achieved this turnaround, not politicians. I know the politicians like to hog the credit. WOODRUFF: Time. KEYES: But it's the people who have made the change. WOODRUFF: All right. The next question for Senator McCain. Senator, up until the South Carolina primary, there's no record that I can find of your criticizing either Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell or the religious right. In fact, you appeared on the 700 Club back in 1995. In the last session of Congress, you had a hundred percent rating from the Christian Coalition. You have been consistently supportive of most of their agenda against abortion, against funding for the arts, against including sexual orientation in hate crimes, for school prayer, for the constitutional amendment to outlaw flag burning. My question is, isn't your denunciation three days ago more politically motivated? And does it speak in a more political connotation than the support that you have given these groups for so many years? MCCAIN: Well first of all, I share their values and their goals of the rank and file of the so-called Christian right. As I have said, I am a proud conservative with a strong conservative record in the tradition of Ronald Reagan and Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. And I am proud of that record. I am proud that I have been one who has supported many of the issues that have to do with family values. Where I have differed in the past and continue to differ with Mr. Falwell and Mr. Robertson is on issues such as the issue of President Clinton. I voted to impeach President Clinton. I don't believe he's a murderer. Mr. Falwell believes that he's a murderer. Mr. Robertson has espoused some cockamamie theories about the Freemasons.

I may be throwing you a curve here, but I want to ask you about something that John Kerry said this last few days. He talks about linking the cost of the war in Iraq with the need to spend more money on domestic priorities, like healthcare and education and so forth. He's going after the Bush administration for spending so much money in Iraq. But it was just a little over a year ago that Kerry said in an interview on ""Meet the Press"" -- he was asked about whether spending for Iraq should be increased. And he said, yes ""by whatever number of billions of dollars it takes to win."" Isn't he contradicting himself now? ALTMAN: I don't think so, Judy. The point on Iraq -- and it's a not my area, actually. But the point on Iraq is competence or incompetence. You know, Senator Kerry voted to authorize the war an Iraq, and said again recently he would do it again knowing what he knows now. But he didn't vote for incompetence, and that's what we've received. And the $200 billion that has been spent so far has been spent poorly. We know the conditions on the ground now in Iraq. We just all read the news. We know that the death and wounded rates on American soldiers have been going up and not down. This is many months after Mr. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier with that flight suit and said, ""Mission accomplished."" Authorizing the use of force was right. Voting for incompetence is not what Senator Kerry did, but that's what we got. Now, the point really here is they've made the wrong choices. If you measure what we spent in Iraq compared to what we could have done, President Bush has allowed healthcare costs to rise 56 percent since he took office, tuition costs have risen 35 percent since he took office. Energy costs are up over $1,000 a family since he took office. That's why it's harder for the average American family to make ends meet since he took office. And the two overarching duties of a president are to protect the country and to pursue policies which will allow standards of living to rise. The generational promise of this country is to leave the next generation in better shape than the current one founded. And that's not what's happening under President Bush -- on President Bush's watch because he made the wrong choices. WOODRUFF: We're going to have to leave it there. Roger Altman is an adviser to the John Kerry campaign, formerly deputy secretary of the Treasury. Thanks very much. And again our apologies for the audio problems we were having.

But in fact, in parts of the country, including the parts where I live, the stay-at-home order has gone a great distance toward, if not combating, taking this virus out of the danger that it poses, in places where people were not compliant with stay-at-home. Stay-at-home doesn't mean you can't go out. It does mean, however, that it is in the best interest of everyone in the population to stay at home, and that is what is happening across the United States, but unfortunately at various levels. That is why the pandemic is still here in this country. ANDERSON: Yes, okay. I just want to move on from a discussion about COVID- 19, but thank you very much indeed for your insight and your analysis as to what is going on in the states. The Boeing MAX 787 report came out yesterday. This is a report, of course, on what went wrong and let to the crash of two jets and the loss of nearly 400 lives? There is a lot of blame going around, and to go around. Help us understand what this report tells us and just how damning the verdict is? NORTON: The report to not be more damning, it was put out by my committee. And what it shows, indisputably is, what I can only call a fatal combination. NORTON: What we had here was a recklessly negligent corporation, Boeing, whose only concern was getting those planes out and, in the air,, and a totally compliant regulator. The result was that you had a double failure and the loss of hundreds of lives needlessly. Some of them at least could have been saved after the second crash. Every country in the world except the United States, took down this plane. That's why at our hearing, I cross-examined the FAA on why the United States was the last to take down the plane and his mumbo jumbo about data was infuriating because of the data of two crashes was all the data, if you will, that we needed. ANDERSON: Sure. That was needed. Congresswoman a very simple question that is an investigation that went on for 18 months. We know what came out of it. What is the solution going forward, to ensure that people watching this show feel safe in the air? NORTON: It may be easier to fix the planes than it is to fix the regulator. My major concern is that the FAA cannot be depended upon. I think that it is in the best interest and certainly if they want to make a profit and get these planes in the air, for Boeing to do what is necessary. But it will take congress and the press and the executive to fix the regulator, which needs a total overhaul in order to make it an effective regulator in the first place.

26873,29420,CNN,CNN International World News,"GLENN VAN ZUTPHEN, WORLD NEWS: China is hailing a renewed friendship with its old Communist ally North Korea one day after Pyongyang's reclusive leader Kim Jong Il ended a secret trip to Beijing. South Korea says it applauds the visit. It comes two weeks before a historic summit between North and South Korea. CNN's Beijing bureau chief Rebecca MacKinnon reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REBECCA MACKINNON, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF (voice-over): It was his first venture outside of North Korea in 17 years. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il warmly embraced by China's leaders on a three-day visit to Beijing so secret neither government would confirm it even happened or release pictures until the day after Kim returned to Pyongyang by special train. The timing of the visit is important. Two weeks from now, North and South Korean leaders will meet face to face for the first time ever. ZHANG QIYUE, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY (through translator): The Chinese side expressed its support of the upcoming summit and hopes to see positive progress made during the summit, which the Chinese side views as beneficial to relations between North and South Korea and conducive to regional peace and stability. MACKINNON: North Korea continues to suffer from a severe food shortage, now in its fifth year. This week, China pledged to give more food and material aid, although the exact amount was not disclosed. Over the past 20 years, Pyongyang has stuck to its own brand of isolated socialism as China reformed and opened up. China's leaders were eager to show off China's dramatic economic changes since Kim last came here in 1983, and he was proudly shown around one of China's most successful computer companies. Kim reportedly praised China's achievements but did not say whether North Korea would follow suit. ZHANG (through translator): Kim Jong Il told China that North Korea is building socialism according to its own situation, and the Chinese side is building socialism with Chinese characteristics. MACKINNON (on camera): Chinese diplomats insist Beijing's influence over Pyongyang is limited, but Western and South Korean diplomats say they are hopeful Kim's visit to China this week is a sign that his reclusive regime is not only serious about the upcoming Korean summit, but also about becoming more engaged with the rest of the world.

CUOMO: And that investigation will be part of a show, and that is the latest piece, brother. LEMON: Yes, you got the breaking news there. Things can always change, but you got it. That's it. This story, I mean, we talked about it a little bit today, Chris, and I taped our podcast today. We talked about it a little l bit today. But, this, it is, for me, you're the attorney. It seems unusual that someone who was possibly the last person to see Gabby definitely before she disappeared and possibly or probably before she perished is somehow allowed to go scot-free, roam scot-free and get away with it. Not -- look, not a suspect, I get that. But just not even talk to police through an attorney. Nobody watches to see his whereabouts and all of a sudden, he's gone and no one knows where he is. That just seems odd to me and it seems like, and this isn't -- look. It's not about race. But it's about something that people not of privilege, it doesn't seem like they have the opportunity to do that. I mean, you know, I figured if most people would be hauled in and say you got to talk and you got to do whatever. You say it's about whoever has an attorney. If you have an attorney, fine. If you don't, then, you know -- CUOMO: Well, look, an attorney is an officer of the court and everybody hates attorneys until they need one. And the system and law makes it very clear, you can't be made to talk to the police and they may tell you that but that's what Miranda warnings are about, right, and that's under arrest. Look, here are the realities and some of them are frustrating. Right? LEMON: Yes. But hold on. Before you go into that. CUOMO: Yes. LEMON: But most people don't know that, Chris. You get hauled in and police come they think that you got to talk. You think that -- you think that you have to talk to the police. And so, it just seems -- I think for me it's a learning experience because I thought they would have said look, you got to come in here and sit down and talk with your attorney present and maybe then -- (CROSSTALK) CUOMO: They would never say that.

That is really difficult to do. BLITZER: All right. Phil, hold on for one second. I'm going to show our viewers. This is a live picture. We believe the suspect is in that vehicle right there, that police vehicle, being transported right now from a local hospital. We don't know where that suspect is going, but, Tom Fuentes, I suspect they're taking him to a local detention center, a police facility, right now, assuming he got out of the hospital without injury. FUENTES: Right. And if he doesn't need medical treatment, he would go probably to a Broward County Sheriff's Office if they have a substation, or if their actual headquarter is nearby, they'd be going there. Again, the local police at this point are going to probably end up running this case much like Las Vegas. When there's no direct evidence of terrorism, organized crime, narcotics trafficking, it's going to be a local crime. No matter how many people might be injured or killed, it's still going to be under local jurisdiction and the FBI -- BLITZER: The Broward County Sheriff would be in charge? FUENTES: Yes. And all the other agencies that are there, federal, state and local, will assist them in every way possible with the interviews, with the crime scene, with the Twitter and Facebook and internet searches, all of that information, but the Sheriff is probably going to be in charge of this at the end of this. BLITZER: Once again, we believe, in that middle vehicle over there that you see moving, that police vehicle, the suspect is being transported right now. Josh, we're going to see where he's being transported to, but clearly, he was briefly taken to a local hospital. Apparently, he's not injured so they're going to take him someplace. CAMPBELL: Oh, you're right, Wolf. And you know, as you watch these pictures, I mean, this shows what is expected in the diverse, you know, role of law enforcement in this country. As Tom knows as well, being an FBI agent and a police officer, that when you come upon a threat, your first goal is to mitigate that threat. But then once it's mitigated, you immediately render aid, if necessary, to the subject. It shows the professionalism of law enforcement here. I suspect what they did was, you know, give him the once over to see if he had any injuries, if there was -- there were any issues medically. And once that's completed, now it's off to find out -- you know, the interview, found out the motive and the investigation.

Fredricka. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARL ROMINGER, SANDUSKY ATTORNEY: We also felt, quite frankly, that the Matt Sandusky issue was a problem. And once the government chose not to call Matt in their case in chief, we then felt they might be able to call him in rebuttal if Jerry took the stand. So all those things combined did it. Had the government called Matt in their case in chief, as they would have been entitled to -- and if they thought he was credible, I think they would have -- then Jerry might have taken the stand. (END VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: So, Susan, what were the three other counts that the jury did not convict him on? CANDIOTTI: Well, one of the three counts involved the testimony of witness, eyewitness Mike McQueary. You'll remember that he saw in 2001 he testified Jerry Sandusky sexually assaulting or what appeared to be sexually assaulting a young man. He described hearing slapping sounds in the shower. Well, the jury acquitted him of the rape charge in and of itself. However, acquitted him, but did convict him of another indecent assault charge. So they kind of took away one but gave one back, so he was still convicted of a felony in that one instance. And then the other two were misdemeanor charges that they acquitted him from involving a couple of other victims. WHITFIELD: All right. Susan Candiotti, thanks so much for that update. So this story is far from over. We're going to look ahead to Sandusky's planned appeal and the civil suits that might be filed. Our legal guys are standing by. We'll be talking to them a bit later. Overseas now to Kenya. Americans are being urged to leave the port city of Mombasa. Officials have warned of an imminent threat to that city, which is Kenya's second largest and a major tourist attraction. No warnings were issued with the warning. Kenya has recently been hit by grenade attacks blamed on a Somalian terror group. And in Cairo, Egypt, thousands have gathered in Tahrir Square to await the results of a presidential runoff election. But it will be tomorrow before there is official word from Egypt's election commission. Right now, both candidates are claiming victory. The gathering is a stark reminder of the demonstrations last year that brought down the regime of Hosni Mubarak, leading the way to this election.

That is at the end of the day, when we`re talking about longevity and what people are talking about, I think she`s probably going to be OK at the end of the day with saying, ""Hey, I`m watching HLN, SHOWBIZ TONIGHT. And instead of talking about who was nominated, they`re talking about the fact that I wasn`t nominated."" So here we are still talking about Miley Cyrus. HAMMER: Yes. BOYER: I think at tend end of the day she kind of wins. HAMMER: Well, yes, but at the same time, I think all artists who at least want integrity know that having a Grammy still, to this day, it goes hand in hand with artist integrity. You know, there is still some cache to it still. BOYER: There is. HAMMER: And Miley mentions Madonna and Britney making history on the Video Music Awards like she did. But here`s the thing. If you look at them, Madonna, despite what you might imagine, never really has gotten a whole lot of love from the Grammys. It wasn`t until 1999 when she finally won a Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album. That was for ""Ray of Light."" That was actually her first big Grammy win. Before that, she did win a Grammy for Best Long Form Music Video for her Blond Ambition world tour. That was all the way back in 1992, but that wasn`t a big category. Britney nominated in 2000 for Best New Artist. Didn`t get that. Nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album in 2001 and `03, didn`t win. Ten years later, Britney finally gets a Grammy for Best Dance Recording. That was for ""Toxic."" Jawn, do think that Miley is reconsidering her strategy now? MURRAY: I think she should. I think Cyndi Lauper is a great example of someone who used stunts at the beginning of her career, but then she went towards legitimacy. And now she`s considered a song stylist who`s recorded multiple genres of music and is known more for her voice than her psychedelic hair colors. And so you have to make the decision what do you really want? Because a lot of artists have disappeared who took the Miley approach at the beginning. HAMMER: I have a feeling Kanye West wasn`t frustrated at all when he got shut out, because he didn`t get -- he didn`t get completely shut out. He did get a couple of nominations but not in the biggest categories that everybody really wants to be a part of. He`s been making a lot of noise this year, as well. Of course, he and Kim had their baby together. He pulled off that big engagement production, taking up an entire baseball stadium to propose, and then there`s that music video from ""Bound 2.""

BLITZER: What does it say to you that he has not received the order to go ahead and prevent the Russians from using cyber warfare or whatever way to interfere in the upcoming midterm elections or the 2020 presidential elections? SHAWN TURNER, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Yes, I think the most obvious message is that the president still does not take what the Russians did serious with regard to interfering in our election. I think to Phil's point, it's important that we make sure people understand exactly how this process will work and Phil explained it well, but it is absolutely the president's responsibility to receive the intelligence, the finished intelligence, and to make a decision as to whether or not he wants to move forward with some action and then he tells his national security team to go back and to develop some courses of action, develop some options, some proposals in terms of what he should do. One of the questions I wish the admiral has been asked today is whether or not the White House had asked for any courses of action and then made a decision based on other things that we may not be privy to, made a decision that now is not the right time. But it looks like the president, the White House has not asked for courses of action and that's something we should be concerned about. DAVID SWERDLICK, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Wolf, can I just pivot from the nat sec guys to a political point and just simply, that exchange you just played if I'm a Democratic campaign ad maker, you can just cut that and print that and put the word bingo there. You know, Admiral Rogers says, you know, President Putin doesn't think he's -- isn't going to pay a price and then Senator Warren says bingo -- I mean, that is something Democrats are going to seize on. BLITZER: You saw the tweet there, Rebecca, that he posted today, just two words -- witch hunt. There it is right there, with an exclamation point, all caps. He thinks this whole investigation is a witch hunt. REBECCA BERG, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: Right. And so, it's not necessarily surprising, Wolf, given the context president wouldn't have ordered some sort of action, some sort of preventative action to try to keep Russia from doing this again. He hasn't really directed any sort of preventive action. And it's because he doesn't think it's real. BLITZER: Yes, I mean, I guess the question emerging after the White House briefing today is whether he needs Admiral Rogers, head of the Cyber Command, whether he needs a direct order from the president, because the White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said today we haven't told them not to do something, so it's up to him, basically. But can he act on his own on a sensitive issue like that? MUDD: He cannot.",0.058891834878365,2018-02-27
1280759,1593536,CNN,New Day,"of lies and misinformation spread about this bill. And what this bill -- this bill is not about denying people services. What this bill is advocating for is basic freedom, ensuring that everyone is respected and that the government is not allowed to force or to coerce or compel anyone to violate their beliefs or to go against their conscience. This is basically to keep the government from discriminating against people of faith. CUOMO: Right. But fundamentally, what it allows, the mechanism is to allow an individual business owner to refuse to do business with somebody on the basis of it offending their religious beliefs if they do conduct that business. So for example, if I come to you and I say you sell flowers. I want you to sell flowers for me for my marriage to another man. You can say no, correct? FIEDOREK: There's a difference. Again, there's a basic difference between denying someone a cup of coffee or a piece of pizza or selling someone a pencil versus forcing someone to use their creative ability to create a message to support an event, to support an idea that goes against their beliefs. There's a big distinction in America that government should not force us to ever use our business, use our talents to go against what we fundamentally believe. There's a big difference like I said between selling a pencil and forcing someone to draw a mural that portray this is. I mean, think about, for example, we would not force a Muslim to participate in a Koran-burning ceremony. We wouldn't ask a black photographer and force them to go take a picture of KKK event. This is America and America we should be able to live freely and not be forced to endorse ideas. CUOMO: Counselor, tell me that you're not analogizing burning a Koran or the KKK with gay marriage. Do you really see those things as the same thing? FIEDOREK: What I'm saying is that no one should be forced -- as an example, in this bill. It will not deny anyone any service. No one will be kicked out of a restaurant or denied a cup of coffee or piece of pizza. What this simple ensures is that everyone in the state of Arizona, these are common, fundamental freedoms that inherent in our country's history. And this bill simply protects those freedoms and allows people to live according to their faith without the government coming in and saying what you can and cannot believe. CUOMO: It allows people to not do business with gays is what it allows. Your organization has a history of trying to hedge the ability to deal with gay marriage and gay rights in the country. All somebody has to do is Google your organization. So let's just be open and honest about it. Why is dealing with gays or gay marriage out to a substantial burden of someone's religion? Whose religion does that burden? FIEDOREK: Chris, you're misunderstanding",0.0732890046491781,2014-02-24

COOPER: Well, this is an attack on two members of the Jewish community in the perimeter of a synagogue. So it is an attack. But 10 years ago was the Buford Furrow attack, in which he shot up a Jewish day camp and murdered a Filipino-American postal worker. But we were his original target. So, unfortunately, in America, hate crimes are part of the scene. Violence is a part of the scene. And we have to make sure that while we have a constitutional right to exercise freedom of religion in the greatest country in the world, the realities are, we have to expend the resources and be concerned that people just doing their daily, wonderful freedoms here have to be concerned about the violence.

Do what what happened in Panama, play rock music? Just wait until they give up? JAMES CARAFANO, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Let's get back to the previous point first. There is also another value that would have been very useful, and that is from a propaganda standpoint. To have those men, to show the humiliation of them being led away -- led away in chains, to have them go through a public trial and to have an opportunity, basically, to put the regime on trial would have had enormous -- would have been enormous value. Now, it's a little difficult to say against the Military -- I mean, one problem here is, you know, we don't know everything that happened in the incident. We have very sketchy details. So, it is kind of hard to critique it. A couple of things I take away is one, they said a six-hour battle. So, that leads me to believe that they did try to make some effort (UNINTELLIGIBLE) to try to route these guys out. And two, if you look at the destruction, it seems to me what happened is, just looking at what I have seen on television, they got into a firefight, they couldn't get them out, and then they basically had to go in and blast their way in, and they were killed in that... HOLMES: The last -- the last media reports I've seen say that they had a couple of AK-47s. There were reports also they had RPGs, but they were certainly no match for the 101st Airborne and 200 well-trained troops. What would be the problem in putting up a perimeter that you could see? I mean, it's typical, as they say, with 20/20 hindsight -- and I know you don't have a crystal ball -- but why would that not have been a tactic? Why would the orders, as Ray said, have not come down from top to keep these men alive? CARAFANO: Well, I'm sure -- I'm sure they would have done that if they could have. You know, one is you have to -- look, how much intelligence, how much warning did they have? Did they rush to the scene? If they rushed to the scene, you have to ask is do they have an escape tunnels? Do they have escape networks? And so even if you cordon the area, you are not sure if you are going to grab anybody or not. So, you are faced with this tension. Go in quick and make sure you get them. Or, you know, take care and risk losing them.

We don't know if our first-generation vaccines will be what we call something that gives us sterilizing immunity, meaning, prevents you from getting infected. Or will it be something that prevent you from having complications, being hospitalized? Any of those would be a win. 90 percent is a high bar and that's what we see in our best vaccines like the measles vaccine, but we shouldn't release -- we shouldn't let perfect be the enemy of the good, and we should really look for a vaccine that just decreases the complications. That would really change the whole game. BLACKWELL: The public health, in this case, will require public confidence, we know. And we heard from Dr. Fauci yesterday about the confidence that Americans should have in the vaccine that's coming, although we know that some people will be reluctant. Here is what Dr. Fauci said.

Of course, there's what we're seeing with the CDC and the softening of guidance for schools and rushing states to be open, and governors saying that you know, maybe they opened too soon. Has or can politics impact one's willingness to take this vaccine? ADALJA: Definitely that can be the case. We've seen that with the rise of the anti-vaccine movement being enabled by celebrities and politicians like RFK Jr., for example. So, we have to be important -- we -- it's very important that we are very clear about what the risk and benefit of this vaccine is, and what the data is, what this -- what the side effect profile is, and what age groups different side effects occur. We want to be very open and transparent about this because we know that there are going to be voices from politics, from the culture that are going to tell people not to get this vaccine. And we saw that during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccination campaign. It had the lowest uptake of a flu vaccines. So, we really have to be careful. We're in a different era now where people do have this distrust of expertise that's really coming from the top down. And we want to make sure that we have a safe and effective vaccine.

VAUSE: The first lady and Joe Biden will also attend the funeral. At least one other victim is being laid to rest this week. And President Obama spoke casually about race relations in a podcast interview. Here's part of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (voice-over): And it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say ""nigger"" in public. That's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It's not just a matter of overt discrimination. We have -- societies don't overnight completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior. (END VIDEO CLIP) ASHER: That interview got a lot of people talking. We'll have more on the reaction to the president's choice of words later on in the show. VAUSE: Now the admitted killer in that shooting, Dylann Roof, says he shot the black worshipers because he wanted to spark a race war. CNN's Ed Lavandera has more on the investigation into a manifesto which was posted on a website registered to the 21 year old. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Investigators tonight are looking into the motives for the murders and focusing on a 2,000- word racist rant posted on a website registered to Dylann Roof just hours before his deadly rampage. The pictures accompanying the manifesto are alarming. He is seen burning an American flag, waving a Confederate Flag and posing with a .45 caliber Glock pistol, the same caliber gun, investigators say, that was used in the church shooting. In the words he writes a pattern of anger and bigotry. (SHOUTING) LAVANDERA: Roof states the Trayvon Martin case triggered his decision to kill, writing, ""It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right, but more importantly, this prompted me to type in the words ""black on white crimes"" into Google and I have never been the same since."" His hatred expands beyond African-Americans, to Hispanics and the Jewish community, stating, ""Most Jews are always thinking about",0.4669731258840169,2015-06-22

The new rule dramatically limits the ability of Central Americans to claim asylum if they have not sought protection from another country on their way to the U.S. The move essentially bars people traveling through Mexico from claiming asylum. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader-Ginsburg dissented. The ACLU says it will continue to challenge the rule. BRIGGS: President Trump is said to be considering Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for a second full time job, replacing John Bolton as National Security adviser. It's not clear just how serious the president is about Pompeo serving dual roles. Sources say the country's top diplomat has given the president a list of other potential replacements for Bolton. The move is not without precedent. Henry Kissinger was already President Nixon's National Security adviser when he was appointed secretary of State back in 1973. ROMANS: The House Judiciary Committee votes today to define the parameters of its impeachment investigation into President Trump. The resolution is expected to lay out the ground rules for potential impeachment hearings.

Let's go to Mark McKay is covering it for us in Vancouver. First of all, Mark, let's talk about this, the fallout from the death of the Georgian luger. You reported on this first here on CNN on Friday afternoon. We had reported there was an accident and subsequently found out it was a tragic death. What's happened since then? MARK MCKAY, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Well, what's happened since then is a number of changes have been made, Ali, to that luge track. We've also heard from the father of the 21-year-old who was killed Friday, just six hours before the start of the opening ceremony here in Vancouver. The father of Nodar Kumaritashvili talking to the ""Wall Street Journal."" He said he spoke to his son, Ali, in the days leading up to his fatal crash on the whistler sliding centre. His son told him he was terrified of the track and quote, ""scared of one of the turns."" His father said that he -- his childhood dream of becoming an Olympian since childhood and he felt he could have competed in at least two Olympics. A tragic set of circumstances to open the Olympics here in Vancouver. And really, Ali, a real roller coaster of emotions throughout the weekend leading into this Monday morning. VELSHI: Interesting. They've changed a lot of things, including making it a shorter track for both men and women. Everybody gets a little bit of a shorter track. There's mixed responses to that. There are some lugers who, I understand, were feeling this track was a little dangerous and others who were saying they shouldn't be changing it. MCKAY: Yes, and all the talk going in, Ali, was of the fact that this is the fastest track in the world. A lot of these races were coming down, the competitive nature in you will probably say let's do this, let's deal with the fastest track and not necessarily think so much about safety. Although truth be said, before Friday's tragedy, there were some lugers that came down and did say that they were worried about the safety of this. But yes, after Friday, the official investigation found that there were no deficiencies in the track, although they did put up a wall in that turn where the 21-year-old lost his life.

We're seeing in Kenya the beginning of, for the very first time, of political accountability with regard to these matters, and I think that's positive, number one. Number two, we have seen the persistence of a sense of public outrage. In other words, the public isn't exhausted with this issue. They're not of the feeling that this is not going to stop and therefore there's nothing they can do about it, since outrage has been sustained. So a lot of positive developments. Number two, despite this outrage - number three, besides, despite this outrage, we haven't seen any kind of violent demonstrations. I think Kenyans have responded with maturity. And I think that all that is positive. So I think the attitude of Kenyans very much is that they are determined to hold their government to account, and that's not going to change, and in fact, they are - the intensity with which they want to do this seems to be rising.

DR. JEROME KIM, DIRECTOR GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL VACCINE INSTITUTE: If you can't control the pandemic, and you don't have access to vaccine, you're not going to be -- you're going to be in a situation we were in in the spring of 2020, with hospitals being full, with people being denied admission and people dying at home.

So that was the starting platform. This year, we will sell 11 million pairs of shoes made out of ocean plastic. But we're going beyond that. So with football jerseys, so when a Real Madrid or Manchester United launched their jersey, sometimes, it is made out of ocean plastic. We have, you know, outdoor. We have shorts, and so we have expanded more and more to the entire portfolio. And that business will be close to half a billion for us now. And what we just announced about a month ago was a fully recyclable shoe. In 2021, we will come out with a product that in all of its component, it will be fully recyclable.

MALVEAUX: Obama is hoping this state, including nearly half of its voter who are African-American, will deliver a good chunk of the 66 delegates up for grabs on Saturday's primary. Senator Clinton stumped in Arlington, Virginia, where she's confident she will capture some of the 83 delegates at stake there on Tuesday. CLINTON: Hello, Arlington. MALVEAUX: Both camps are competing for big cash to keep their campaigns going in the months ahead. After Clinton revealed she had to loan $5 million of her own money to her presidential campaign, aides announced after Super Tuesday, a fund-raising blitz over the Internet brought in at least $6.4 million. Her loan has already been paid off. Obama's campaign says they have netted $7 million over the same period. (END VIDEOTAPE) MALVEAUX: And Clinton's camp is putting more pressure on Obama for more debates -- the Clinton campaign manager sending a letter to her Obama counterpart challenging Obama to five more debates -- that's one each week -- leading up to the March 4th contest. Now, Obama said that he would go ahead and accept two of those because he says he needs to spend more time getting to know the voters -- Wolf. BLITZER: And one of those debates would be in Ohio before those March -- the March 4th primary there, a very, very significant primary, March 4th in Ohio, and in Texas. So, we can anticipate that one of those debates will take place in Ohio. We're going to be hosting one of those debates in Ohio at the end of February. MALVEAUX: And, Wolf, Ohio is very important, Ohio and Texas as well, because the Clinton campaign, they believe they have an advantage here. Look at the voters, they tend to be older. There are a lot of blue-collar voters. You look at Texas, its Latino community, they believe that she is going to perform well in that area for that contest. So, that debate is going to be very important in terms of who's watching. BLITZER: Thanks very much, Suzanne Malveaux in Chicago watching the Democratic race which is clearly heating up, very, very close. Let's get back to the Republican contest right now. Mitt Romney says he still disagrees with John McCain on a number of issues, but he won't keep fighting the Republican front-runner. Romney made the surprise announcement today he's suspending his presidential campaign. He did it in front of a conference of conservatives right here in Washington, a group he had hoped would help him win the nomination. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This isn't an easy decision. I hate to lose. My family, my friends, you, my supporters across the country, you have given a great deal to get me where I have a shot at becoming president. If this were only about me, I would go on.

2386297,2707363,CNN,Don Lemon Tonight,"Kagan said, her warning? LAURA COATES, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Justice Kagan is absolutely right. I mean, this would be the definitive slippery slope. We often hear about this could be a slippery slope, it might have a domino effect. If you allow states to be able to an end run around judicial review, you essentially give them cart blanch to do whatever they want as long as they figure out a way not to have a state actor enforce the law. Remember, fundamentally, what's wrong with this case is that normally, if you want to try to prevent a law from going into effect, you have to be able to sue the state actor who is charged under the statute to actually enforce the law. In Texas, they decided, huh, we will avoid that by allowing anyone in the country, not a state actor in Texas, to be able to sue anyone who aids in an abortion, thereby allowing them to just avoid judicial review. Now, if that's allowed, she is right. It's not just hot-button issues like abortion or gun rights or anything else. COATES: It could be everything that could be fair game, and that's not a blueprint that can actually sustain itself. LEMON: So, the judges who already voiced opposition to the Texas law are obviously in favor of letting it be challenged. Conservative Justice Kavanaugh, Coney Barrett, they are showing that they are open to letting abortion clinics challenge the law in court. For them, is this about whether the law is constitutional? COATES: Not yet. And that's the thing about right now. You know, we've heard already thinking about there is a Mississippi case a few weeks from now deciding whether a 16-week ban is going to be constitutional. With this challenge in Texas, it's not quite at the, is it constitutional stage, which has surprised people. Right now, it's at the, who could sue, wo could actually avoid having to be vulnerable to this evasion of judicial review and bring a case in the courts. There were two different parties involved. Of course, the Department of Justice, the federal government wanting to intervene on behalf of being able to enforce federal laws. Then you had the clinicians, the abortion clinics and providers who said we'd like to be able to sue and be in court because we are the ones when are not hypothetically going to be challenged. We are the ones with the most to lose in terms of financial penalties. And they can be retroactive, Don. They can also not have a ceiling. You might lose one case of $10,000, but that is nothing to prevent more and more people from suing you. And it could be, as Justice Kavanaugh spoke about this, up to a million dollars. And the idea that these clinicians would always be vulnerable for any person across the country seemed to be the most persuasive to this court right now. But we have time.

271517,456021,CNN,International Correspondents,"MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Hello. I'm Michael Holmes. Welcome to CNN'S INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTS, where we examine how the media are covering the big stories. The Asia tsunami has dominated news coverage for more than two weeks. Now, however, some media organizations are starting to pull their teams out of the region. What responsibility do we as journalists have in keeping the story on the news agenda? To discuss this further, I'm joined from London by ITV correspondent Dan Rivers, who has just returned from Indonesia's Aceh region. Also, Howard Kurtz, media columnist for the ""Washington Post"" and host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" Dan Rivers, if I can start with you, in London, you spent a lot of time there. Tell me, do you think media organizations took too long to actually respond to this disaster? DAN RIVERS, ITV CORRESPONDENT: No, I don't think they did. I think we, along with several other media companies, were very quick to respond to the disaster. We were there within 49 hours, which was as quick as we could physically get there. How long it stays on the agenda, though, is a different issue. The news agenda is difficult to predict and difficult to control. I'm not sure really it's our job as correspondents to dictate what should be the news agenda. I think we have lots of other responsibilities in how we report this disaster, in the humanity that we report it with, in the way that we report it, in the objectiveness with which we report on it, but I don't think it's our job to decide that this should be the news for the next two months and no other story should feature at all. I think there is a big danger that the viewers will certainly get concern fatigue, that they will give up caring and switch over if they're just confronted by day after day of images of death and destruction, and that's one of the big challenges in news, is to try and hold people's interests on big stories like this, and I think we've managed to do that for a couple of weeks. But it's inevitable the news agenda will move on. I think our responsibilities are more wide-ranging perhaps on reporting on how, for example, NGOs and governments respond to this crisis, making sure that they do respond to this crisis, make sure the money gets to the people who need it and make sure the aid is getting through. We can report on those, but there is only so long that we can hold people's attention before the agenda inevitably moves on to something else. HOLMES: Important point. I'd like to raise that with you, Howard Kurtz. Like it or not, media is a business and once the public loses interest, so too does the media, because inevitably if they don't then the ratings are going to fall, despite the story's obvious journalistic and moral importance. Is that just a fact of life? HOWARD KURTZ,",0.0154637775605517,2005-01-15

Al Baker does not mention any names, but points to the efforts by some to make a big splash at a big show. AL BAKER: Especially with Airbus and Boeing. They all want to have big announcements. DEFTERIOS: To roll out at the air show? AL BAKER: Exactly. DEFTERIOS: Using a shortcut through the exhibition hall, the chief executive makes his way to a press conference announcing a move into the corporate jet market. Qatar Airways continues to spread its wings. Not to keep pace with its neighbors, says Al Baker, but with the gulf state's own economy, one of the fastest growing in the world. DEFTERIOS: So you must have some concerns that all this capacity is being added in the neighborhood, that it throws off your business plan? AL BAKER: We are going to make sure that all this capacity that is added around us would not deviate us from the plans we have. Without expanding in a way that we will not be able to sustain and that hubs like Dubai and Abu Dhabi will start undermining our airline. This will not happen. DEFTERIOS: Doha will open a new airport in two years to handle 24 million passengers. As it expands, Al Baker says Qatar can double capacity when needed. DEFTERIOS: China, Japan, Africa, Latin America. These are the real hubs of growth, have been for the last five years. Is that the strategy going forward then? AL BAKER: And you will notice that this is exactly what Qatar Airways is doing. So as you know that that his happening, and this is what exactly we are doing, which means that what we are doing in our strategy going forward is correct. DEFTERIOS: Despite real concerns Al Baker has about another slowdown in Europe, he is adding another seven European routes by early next year. He calls those routes bright spots amidst some darkness.

JOHN HARWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Poppy, I think the key phrase in Joe Manchin's quote a moment ago was, if the judge rules it pertinent. Republicans, of course, can call Hunter Biden at any point. The question is, will Roberts say this is pertinent to the case? Now he could be overruled if he says no, but I think everybody recognizes at this point, people like Joe Manchin are trying to appear judicious and so are Republicans, a select group of Republicans on the other side who are keeping an open mind. But I really think this is about private persuasion on those vulnerable senators. You can see from the president's behavior this morning that he is concerned and working hard to try to round up that unanimous or near unanimous Republican support. He had a two-pronged tweet storm. One saying Democrats will never be satisfied. That's an appeal to partisan solidarity on behalf of the Republicans. And the second is that laser attack on John Bolton, in essence saying this is someone who is nasty, untrustworthy, a warmonger.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID TRAN, FOUNDER, HUY FONG FOODS, INC.: Not so strong, and if strong, my walker cannot walk. ADAM HOLLIDAY, HUY FONG FOODS, INC: There is no smell at all and my head is directly over the unit. (END VIDEO CLIP) BALDWIN: OK, CNN's legal analyst, Danny Cevallos joins me now. Danny, help me understand, first, what exactly is a nuisance law? DANNY CEVALLOS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: So, nuisance can take one of two forms. Public or private, but the general idea is this. We have a concept called tress pass. That's when someone comes on your property and interferes with your right to possess that property, but nuisance is a little different. Nuisance is about interfering with your right to enjoy your property. Whereas no one has put anything physical on the property, although in the case of odors, since all odors are particulate, you could make the argument it is also a trespass, but that's basically the gist of a case like this. The government has said you have created a public nuisance with this odor that emanates from your factory and it interrupts or disrupts everyone else's enjoyment of their property. BALDWIN: OK, that has to be tricky because we're talking about something intangible about an odor. According to our affiliate there, the city is now recommending that the company bring in this new filtration system. It's not cheap, like $600,000. And the company on the other hand, they don't want to install something they say they don't need. How do you think this plays out? CEVALLOS: Well, it's difficult to say because in addition, this is not just a typical odor. Sometimes you get odors that are just bad smelling, sometimes they're good smelling but -- BALDWIN: Hershey, Pennsylvania, anyone? CEVALLOS: Pardon? BALDWIN: I said, Hershey, Pennsylvania, anyone? CEVALLOS: Sure, wouldn't mind that as a nuisance. The reality is this is some weapons-grade hotness. I should know. I am a Sriracha addict. The problem is once it vaporizes, there may be an issue with not just a smell but a burning sensation. After all, that's what it's",0.6789425688202106,2013-10-30

What did he -- what did you ask him and what did he say? NIMA EBAGIR, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What was extraordinary, Wolf, is that I asked him whether he quite believed that this has happened. And his answer was, no. He is almost as shocked as the rest of the nation and the rest of the world. The issue that's becoming very quickly apparent, though, is that the (INAUDIBLE) that was leveled at both sides of this campaign, the leave and the remain (ph), which is they were big on slogans but really very sparse on details. That is now starting to hit home here. Because even this morning, he had a lot of very big, bold answers, but he didn't really have any of the fine detail of how any of this was going to happen. He said that the relationship with the U.S. was going to continue to be closer than ever, in spite (ph) of Barack Obama's warnings, that they would be able to continue to play a key role in terror and cooperation, the global war on terror. And, yet, really nothing is really that concrete. The reality is, as one voter said to me this morning, the entire nation feels, as realization dawns, almost as if it's waking up to a hangover -- Wolf. BLITZER: Erin, many are wondering if -- how big of an impact this will have on the European Union. You're outside at the E.U. headquarters over there in Brussels. How are E.U. officials reacting? ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, E.U. leaders are trying to reassure people, Wolf. What we're hearing are expressions of unity, sorrow, regret, respect for the democratic process. But we're also hearing expressions of resilience. President of the European council, Donald Tusk, saying, quote, ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."" Now, at the same time, there is growing concern here in Brussels about euro skepticism across the continent. We've already heard for calls for similar referendums in countries such as France as well as the Netherlands. And that is going to impact any sort of exit negotiations the U.K. might undertake with the E.U. I spoke to one senior diplomat who told me that there will be no niceties in those negotiations. That there is no E.U. leader that wants to see a Brexit look like an attractive option to other E.U. member states -- Wolf. BLITZER: Interesting. Matthew, the Russian president, Putin, may be one of the few leaders in the -- around the world supporting this decision. What's the reaction over there in Moscow?

854872,1131656,CNN,Quest Means Business,"did you make of that wording? That additional accommodation they're talking about? PETER MORICI, PROF. OF INT'L. BUSINESS, UNIV. OF MARYLAND: Well, they are acknowledging reality. The U.S. economy is indeed slowing again, although it hasn't gone negative. Yesterday's statement about the end of the recession was almost meaningless given how much it was hedged. We have to recognize there isn't much left the Fed can do. It already has a price of money that is near zero. Additional quantitative easing won't mean that much because mortgage rates are already at rock bottom levels. The real problem here is the exchange rate. Modern economics teaches us that if you have a fixed exchange rate in a depressed economy, namely the dollar versus the yuan in this case. There is not much more that monetary policy can do. We are making a big party over something that is not very significant, that is Fed policy, right now. FOSTER: Is there also a concern that if they were going to do some more quantitative easing it would show that they are very much behind other countries, which seem not to be easing at all, they're cutting back. MORICI: Well, what does it mean? I mean, we have a lot of money out there. And the banks can't lend it, or won't lend it. In reality the money is in the wrong places. It is at the JP Morgan, but it is not at the Toledo Savings & Loan. I don't think it is a question of being behind. I think it is a question of the West. The European Union, Japan, United States, not confronting China, because it is essentially, controlling their monetary policy. You know, every day China goes into the foreign exchange market and buys dollars and turns around and then buys bonds, euro bonds, U.S. bonds, what have you, with those dollars. And in turn keeps interest rates depressed. So, I think we have gone as far as we can with interest rates. We have to have an exchange rate adjustment so trade will adjust, vis-a-vis China, and the Western economies will have enough demand to grow. FOSTER: The truth is, though, that people do look at these statements with great interest and if there was any alarming wording within that statement it would have sent the market sideways, so it is not completely irrelevant. MORICI: Oh, absolutely not. As long as the market puts weight on what the Fed says, what the Fed says is relevant. Certainly, suppose the hawks, like Hoenig, who are worried about inflation, had their day. And the Fed said, well, you know, while we're concerned about the economy sinking, we're going to have to keep a tight rein on the money supply or we're going to have to cautious about further easing. That would have sent the market in the other direction, certainly.

HARLOW: Let's begin with this news that an American passenger who was evacuated on one of those U.S. chartered jets overnight from a cruise ship that was docked in Japan, told CNN that she didn't know that there were others contaminated on that flight until she (INAUDIBLE) concern is that for you, and should it be for her and others? DEL RIO: You know, I don't think it's much of a concern. I can tell you that the CDC and the people that plan the evacuation and bringing home those almost 400 Americans, did a very, very good job. This was a very carefully planned operation in which people were tested, people were put -- those that were infected were placed in sort of isolation compartments, areas in the plane and they were separated from the noninfected individuals. And then they're going to be -- you know, those infected, as you mentioned, have been taken to the University of Nebraska, to their biocontainment unit for management. And those that are not infected have been kept in quarantine either in San Antonio or in California. So I think what the U.S. is really trying to do is prevent further spread in this country from those affected (ph) individuals. Let's remember, the U.S. up to now had had 15 confirmed infections. With this number brought in, it's almost doubled the number of people that we now have in the country. HARLOW: Yes. And when it comes to what Kristie just reported -- and that is the death of this hospital director, just this morning, as a result of this in China -- and then the doctor who blew the whistle about all of this in China, dying from the disease just about two weeks ago, is China doing enough to protect the frontline people addressing this, the doctors that are addressing the crisis? DEL RIO: You know, it's very hard for me to say yes or no. I suspect they're probably not doing enough, simply because -- simply because they're overwhelmed, right? HARLOW: Yes. DEL RIO: It's very hard to do as much as you need to do when you probably don't have the necessary equipment. But what we know from this infection, what we know from SARS, what we know from MERS is that there's a lot of transmission within hospitals, what we call nosocomial transmission. And not only health care workers, but other patients are at risk. So we as health care workers have to take really special precautions and CDC has and WHO has recommended that we use gloves, that we use a gown, that we use a special mask called an N95 mask, which has to be fitted, and that we use eye protection, we need to use a face mask, you know, eye cover. So I would suspect that there's simply not enough supplies of these materials available for all the health care workers in China.

And he's doing well in Iowa. So, I think that the super PACs are a real problem in terms of our country. And I am talking about Ben. I did talk about Jeb because I thought Jeb was going to be the front-runner. Obviously, he's no longer the front-runner. I probably won't talk about him so much anymore.

Look, one of the things that we've seen over the past couple of months is that the U.S. has been, or at least President Trump has been clear that he wants out of Syria. And the U.S. has really been essentially marginalized as a player on the ground both in terms of the military but also of course, in terms of diplomacy as well. In fact only a couple of days ago, there was this summit on the future of Syria that was held by Turkey, Iran, and Russia with the U.S. of course not being at the table. And those three countries as well are the ones that have shown long-term military commitments here to Syria and have essentially laid out their positions for what they wanted to see there and followed through it. If you look at the areas here in Damascus, especially there in Douma where this alleged attack happened, it is the Russians that are clearly calling the shots there and the Syrian government that is advancing in those places. President Bashar al-Assad is in a stronger position now than he has been since I was would say 2015. So while there are some people here in Damascus who fear that there could be some sort of U.S. retaliation, there are very few who believe that retaliation would lead to a decisive shift in Syria's ongoing civil war. Of course, it's been going on since 2011, Lynda. KINKADE: That's right, now in its seventh year. Fred, just stand by for us. I want to go to Ben because we also heard from President Trump taking a dig at the previous administration, at President Barack Obama saying that if he'd taken military action after a major alleged gas attack in 2013, the Syrian disaster would have ended a long time ago. And this of course despite Donald Trump tweeting at the time that attacking Syria would only lead to bad things. Ben, what's your take on that kind of passing the buck, blaming the previous administration. Could the previous administration have done more here? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, certainly, I think (INAUDIBLE) analyst on the situation in Syria since the beginning of the uprising there in 2011, the administration of Barack Obama made a series of mistakes. First of all, it called for the overthrow of the regime and then Barack Obama set out the red line the use of chemical weapons that Bashar al-Assad should not cross and of course on the 21st of August 2013, widely believed that the regime did cross that line with a chemical attack in Ghouta, that left more than a thousand people dead, really the United States has just made one mistake after another and no administration is really innocent in that regard.

That is the biggest decline since the recession of the early '80s. Without that decline, the gross domestic product would have grown more than 2 percent for the quarter. Lisa Leiter has the report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LISA LEITER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The economy grew at its slowest pace in eight years between March and June. Gross domestic product edged up 7/10 of a percent. It was the fourth quarter in a row of growth less than two percent. That hasn't happened since the last recession a decade ago. But for economists fearing recession, any growth at all will do. HILL CHENEY, JOHN HANCOCK FINANCIAL SERVICES: We've had three very weak quarters in a row, but they're still saying positive. And that, fundamentally, is what Alan Greenspan was targeting all along. He wanted to slow us down to a positive growth, but below potential for a while. LEITER: To blame, capital spending, it plunged 13.6 percent, the biggest drop in 19 years -- no surprise, with all of those dismal corporate financial outlooks. But consumer spending, which accounts for 2/3 of the economy, rose 2 percent. Without that spending, on everything from cars to appliances, GDP would have been down. Businesses are still scrambling to get rid of unwanted stockpiles. They reduced $27 billion of inventories in the second quarter. The question is whether they're done, and ready to ramp up production when demand picks up.

262307,442929,CNN,International Correspondents,"MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN ANCHOR: Hello. I'm Matthew Chance, in London. Welcome to CNN'S INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTS, where we examine how the media are covering the big stories of the moment. A nation divided, a disputed election and the specter of civil war lurking in the streets of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, where tens of thousands of protestors are speaking out against what they and most of the Western world are denouncing as an unjust and corrupt election. And while the world's press keeps vigil over the latest developments, it's proving a tough story to tell for the Ukrainian media. Up until Friday, many television stations were being pressurized not to show the protests. The first reports of mass protests aired only on Friday morning, when in a rare move the pro-government private channel 1+1 announced it will no longer succumb to censorship. I'm joined now in Kiev by Yevhen Hlibovitsky, former anchor at 1+1. He resigned at protest at the election coverage. Yevhen, thank you very much for joining us from Kiev. Let me ask you first of all, it must be very difficult to cover this political crisis in Ukraine. How are the local media covering it when we around the world watch these hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of the capital. YEVHEN HLIBOVITSKY, FMR. 1+1 ANCHOR: Well, the Ukrainian media has suffered significant pressure from the government. If we are speaking of big media -- big media outlets, until yesterday they were quite defendant. Yesterday, the three biggest Ukrainian television channels overcame the pressure and they managed to start reporting -- doing actually professional news. CHANCE: I think what's staggering, Yevhen, for much of us watching around the world, is that for the first five days or so of these mass protests with hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of the nation's capital, the main broadcasters in Kiev weren't even showing the population of Ukraine the pictures. What were people in Ukraine thinking was happening? HLIBOVITSKY: Well, talking to people who live outside of Kiev, I can tell that there is definite lack of information, especially in the east of Ukraine, where most of the media are controlled by political or financial groups that are related to the prime minister or President Kuchma. And people are quite disoriented. They don't really understand what's going on inside the country. They've seen the mass falsifications, but many of them were used to that still yet from Soviet time. So I can tell that a lot of people, especially in the east of Ukraine, do not really understand what is going on inside the country. They are quite confused. Those areas that are covered by free media are actually OK. They understand what's on. They understand the protests. They see the oppositions of both -- the government and the opposition. They have access to all of the information available. CHANCE: Now, you resigned your position as anchor of 1+1 television in Ukraine. Why did you do that?",0.1383205400260232,2004-11-27

I think we probably get a lot of air travel through on Sunday night, but by the time Monday rolls around, almost every airport up and down the east coast will be shut, not even -- if they don't close their doors. You're just not going to see airlines send their planes into that type of system and then risk having either a bumpy landing, you know, the plane being on the ground in a hurricane. There just won't be flights. COOPER: This may be an unanswerable question. When will we know how bad this is going to be or what it's going to actually kind of look like? At this point, it's still kind of far out. MYERS: It is kind of far out and it was far out last night. At some point last night, I had three models. I tweeted about this in the middle of the night. I had three models bringing a Category 3, almost Category 4 hurricane, into New York harbor. COOPER: Wow. MYERS: This is ugly. It backed off today because the storm simply didn't generate coming out of the Bahamas. It didn't generate a lot like Irene didn't generate. So if this thing stays kind of like the Irene, this becomes not a big deal. But that's not the forecast. Not a single model does that. Every model turns it back into the northeast, either from New York City all the way down to North Carolina and then here's the rub that we've never gone through this before. There's not been ever an instance where a computer model has had to work this out in its head or in its computer. There's a cold air mass back here, there's a low here, and another low here, and they're going to combine. What is going to happen when those two combine, we honestly simply don't know. There's not been any history for this in the computer program, the program's only been running for 25 years. Maybe a little bit less. COOPER: So just explain to me briefly, what is so unique about that, that combination? MYERS: You have the moisture from a tropical storm and then you have the wind and the energy and even the potential for snow with a low pressure that is a normal low pressure. It's just a winter type low that's coming in from the west and from the southwest. When they get together, you have a storm that already wants to make 40 mile per hour winds, then you add another storm that has 70 mile per hour winds already in it. And when you smash those together, you get what's called a hybrid, a double type storm and all of a sudden, you have energy from one, cold from one, and",0.6474656188605108,2012-10-26

CAROL LIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Daryn, talking about a really terrible wreck on Interstate 40, just north of Chapel Hill, North Carolina. It's in an area called Hillsborough. Some 15 different collisions over a stretch of five miles in a really short period of time. The first of the accidents occurred around 7:30 this morning during the rush hour. And you're seeing some of the new video that just came into the CNN Center. A bus was also involved in this big traffic pileup that's now being blame on the weather and just the fact that there are so many -- there's the bus. There's so many cars on the road. One of the passengers on that bus has been transported to a local hospital. So far we don't know of any other more serious injury. But, obviously, not the commute you'd want to have there in North Carolina. KAGAN: All right. Well, I'll leave to you watch that. Carol, thank you. Carol Lin. Now to a developing story out of the White House. One that could involve Iran. Our Ed Henry is at the White House with some new details. Ed. ED HENRY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Daryn. That's right, CNN has confirmed here with senior officials that the United States is now ready to join multilateral talks with Iran about its nuclear ambitions. That official announcement is going to be made 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. And we've actually just obtained, our State Department producer Elise Labott, has obtained an excerpt from this speech Secretary Rice will deliver. And it says, ""as soon as Iran fully and verifiably suspends its enrichment and reprocessing activities, the United States will come to the table with our EU-3 colleagues."" That's a reference to the European Union three -- France, Germany and Britain. There is another important condition here that we're hearing from other officials, which is that the U.S. will only do this with Russia and China pledging that they will press sanctions",0.2679623769849334,2006-05-31

And so I think if I can do this, and I have to say, if my life wasn't funny, it would just be true. Some of the stuff, it was certainly not funny at the time, but I have put into words what I have wanted to take out of emotion. So that it's sort of this is the wet world of emotion, words are dry.

FISHER: I made a joke at an AIDS benefit that I'd gotten flowers from Elizabeth Taylor, and that when I received them, I knew they were, you know, an apology for taking my father away 30 years ago. And -- but it just said thank you for doing the AIDS event. BROWN: Right. FISHER: But I could read an apology between the lines. She invited me over and said, I mean, you know, is there something we should talk about? And she was very, very sweet. She did it. She's a lovely woman. BROWN: What do you want to accomplish still?

You still say this is more difficult just because it's more complex, what you're trying to achieve? ABDALLA: Yes. I mean, what I mean to say is politically it's a lot more complicated. You know, you can unify -- you can unify a large number of people over the fact that you want to get rid of, you know, a dictator. Unifying them over what you want and how you want to build your country is -- is much more difficult. Because, you know, building is much more difficult than breaking with the past. But that's not to say, of course -- I mean, of course, the difficulty of what we had in the first sit-in was the violence, which was incredibly clear. But -- and since then we've had -- as I said we've had violence. We've had torture. We've had people killed at the hands of the army. We've been threatened. So, you know, now it's about, you know, learning how to -- finding out how to build the country that we want. COOPER: Fouad, you've always been very optimistic about the so- called Arab Spring. Are you -- are you disappointed by the rate of progress, by the pace of progress in Egypt since Mubarak was toppled? AJAMI: Absolutely not, Anderson. I think, in fact, as we take a look at what has been happening in Egypt, it's remarkable. We have to remember that, even though this Egyptian revolt that you witnessed first-hand was largely peaceful, 850 Egyptians were killed at the hands of the security forces. Not the army. That's a very important distinction. So the families of those 850 people want justice. And it's in the nature of revolutions that they always want to go back to their moment and their place of innocence. And the place and the moment of innocence were these magical 18 days in Liberation Square where the Egyptians claimed the history and drove Pharaoh out of power. And now there's an account, if you will, between the army which backed the people and didn't kill them as the civilian army is killing its own people, and the population which wants speedier change, faster change. One protestor said he wanted freedom, social justice, and bread. Now, these are very, very big demands. And I think that's what we really are looking at in Egypt today. COOPER: Khalid, the elections have now been pushed back in Egypt. They were -- they were supposed to be in September. Now they've been pushed back to October-November. They were -- already had been scheduled earlier than many people had wanted other than the Muslim Brotherhood; other, you know, groups who wanted to be able to establish themselves.

The pollutants in the air, forget about what happens in the year 2050, they reduce your life expectancy today. And you have to do something about it. So it's not an either/or thing. I would argue if you have to do something, if you don't fix the environment, you're not going to be able to help people. Because the people who need jobs, they don't get anything if they have a job and they die ten years earlier. They need to have the ability to take care of themselves and to be healthy and then the job they need at the same time. But I think history shows -- look at New York City.

I can't go into other details other than to say that clearly, this prevented us from recruiting agents who would have worked for the U.S., who had been willing to work for the U.S. under the guarantee that their names and identity would never be made public. After they saw what happened here, it scared people away. BURNETT: Now the death penalty is off the table and you said life in prison makes sense, but it's off the table. Eric Holder, the attorney general, has already taken it off the table for the NSA leaker Edward Snowden. He told the Russians that he would do so in the hopes they would give Snowden back to -- put Snowden back in American custody. Should the death penalty be off the table in all these cases? And I guess already it is in the Manning case, so, what about in the Snowden one? KING: No, I don't think it should be, but again, if it's part of negotiations between the U.S. and Russia, you know, I'm not going to second guess the attorney general on that. KING: Is it possible, though, that the U.S. government, you know, and I say this as both the Democratic administration and the Republicans like yourself overreact a little bit here. You know, Manning was described as the biggest, you know, leak in American history. Snowden, I just recently was talking to a senior law enforcement official, said Snowden has killed people by what he has released. But the president refers to him as a kid. You know, when he was in Senegal, the president said, quote, ""I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker"" as if Snowden is no big deal. So, which is it? I mean, how do we really know if these guys did any damage or is there a grain of truth in what Julian Assange said, that the U.S. government just had it pride wounded that anybody could leak anything. KING: No, this is not pride. We're talking about life and death. And I am very critical of the president when he really sends a mixed message at times, for instance, he says that al Qaeda is decimated, but at the same time, he's expanding NSA coverage, which I think is necessary, because al Qaeda is not decimated. When he says that Snowden is just a 29-year-old kid, at the same time, the Justice Department is going after him on espionage charges. It's a very mixed signal. I think the president has to be much more consistent and really throughout his administration, it's been -- he says one thing, says another, and it's very mixed message, which is misunderstood by our allies and our enemies.

98561,114642,CNN,CNN Tonight,"STEPHEN FRAZIER, CNN ANCHOR: In Goeteborg, Sweden, a summit of the European Union is now overshadowed by a runaway protest that turned into bitter fighting and even gunfire. Today, as the summit closed, 10,000 people gathered in the streets for more peaceful demonstrations. ITN's Bill Neely reports on that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL NEELY, ITN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The European summit ended, as it had begun, in mass protests. For the third successive day, tens of thousands demonstrated against the European Union and against capitalism. There have been arrests, more than 500 now in three days, but no repeat of the mayhem that marred this summit. The Swedes say their police did not lose control here, but for the first time at a European summit, guns were drawn and shots fired; first in the air, then into the crowd. Moments later, this demonstrator is hit. He's now critically ill in a hospital. In all, 65 people have been treated for injuries, including two other demonstrators who were shot. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The problem is that there are 400 or 500 people to just start fighting. They should have (UNINTELLIGIBLE) this, but whatever it was, what kind of weapon the Swedish police would have used. NEELY: Europe's leaders were in somber mood today. They achieved little here, and their work has been overshadowed. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are not democratically elected, you know. They do not have the right to come and disrupt meetings. They are entitled to protest peacefully, they are not entitled to engage in undemocratic anarchy. NEELY: Europe's leaders had to cancel their dinner, some fled their hotels. They left today amid massive security, after the worst- ever violence at a European summit. (on camera): This summit had ended not just in mass protests, but in political failure. Europe's leaders may want the Union to grow, but the cracks and the strains are showing. They can't afford many more summits like this one. Bill Neely, ITN, Goeteborg.

Fallout now from Bernard Madoff's alleged multibillion dollar scheme reverberating from New York to Washington. A federal judge has set new guidelines for his release on bail including a curfew and electronic monitoring. Our senior correspondent, Allan Chernoff, is in New York now with some details on this. Hi there, Allan. ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Heidi. It's been 14 minutes since Bernard Madoff's curfew ended for the night. He's required to stay in his multi-mullion dollar Upper East Side apartment from 7:00 p.m. through 9:00 a.m. under terms of his $10 million bail agreement. He also has to wear an electronic monitoring advice. Now his attorneys agreed to those bail terms after only his wife and brother, but not his two sons, would sign off on his bond. With only two signatures on that bond, Madoff had to post their homes in Montauk, New York and Palm Beach, Florida as part of the bail agreement. The criminal complaint against Madoff says he admitted to the FBI that his investment firm had covered up billions in losses. He's facing a single count of securities fraud which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. And from his lead attorney's comment to CNN, it would appear that he does not plan to contest the charge. Defense attorney, Ira Sorkin, saying, quote, ""This is a tragedy. We are cooperating fully with the government investigation to minimize losses"" -- Heidi. COLLINS: Yes, Allan, a lot of people are wondering in this whole story, where was the regulation? And maybe even to go a step further, how -- do you regulate all of it, all of these deals, if you will, that could be going down? CHERNOFF: Well, certainly not easy to catch this sort of fraud, but the SEC did have tips, they had leads, they looked into Madoff, but they failed to uncover fraud. And even the chairman of the SEC said that is totally unacceptable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTOPHER COX, SEC CHAIRMAN: I was very concerned to learn this week that credible allegations about Mr. Madoff had been made over nearly a decade and yet never referred to the commission for action. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHERNOFF: Chairman Cox says there is no evidence of wrong-doing yet by SEC staff, but he has asked SEC inspector general, David Cox, to investigate. Cox tells CNN, among the issues he'll examine, is the relationship between a former SEC attorney who is part of the team that did inspect the Madoff firm and Bernard Madoff's niece who he married last year. But a spokesman for the former SEC attorney says that he did not participate in any examination of Madoff while he was involved with Mr. Madoff's niece. As you can imagine, Madoff investors are absolutely furious and distraught. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT CHEW, INVESTOR: It's kind of like a financial murder. And",0.3371505120781297,2008-12-18

But my brother, who has participated in this terrorist attack, was probably psychologically ready to commit such an act. These are not regular people. You cannot have the slightest doubt that they have been prepared, that they must not leave any trace which would cause suspicion that they might do such things. And even if you saw them every day, their behavior was quite normal. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: Joining us now is senior investigative correspondent Drew Griffin, who is in Brussels, Belgium. Also with me here in Paris is CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruikshank. Drew, let me start with you. What else have you been able to learn about the brothers' time in Belgium? DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: That they were very well known to the police. More known as petty criminals and drug dealers than anything else, Jake. But you mentioned, they were both questioned last February. That is after the Belgium police were told by the Turks that Ibrahim Abdeslam tried to get into Syria. Now the Belgian police questioned both brothers then and apparently were convinced that they were not trying to get into Syria. We also learned that just eight days before this bombing, that one of the brothers, Ibrahim Abdeslam, was operating a bar not too far from where I am. I believe we even have pictures of that bar. And the bar was shut down by the local authorities here because of what they said was a lot of illicit activity, including drug dealing and drug use. So these were people who had many interactions with the police, but the police say just none of those interactions put up the red flare of terrorism. They thought they were just your run of the mill petty criminals who, quite frankly, there are a lot of in the neighborhood we're in here in Brussels. TAPPER: And, Paul, let me bring you in here because you have some new information about the ISIS video that claimed responsibility for these horrific terrorist attacks. PAUL CRUIKSHANK, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST: That's right, Jake. A security source here in France briefed by investigators telling me that they've identified the voice of a senior French ISIS operative on that claim of responsibility. And the individual in question is called Fabien Clain. Now, this is somebody with a significant track record of terrorist activity. He's believed to be playing a major role for ISIS. European counterterrorism officials I've been speaking to say that he's also suspected to have had a hand in that attempt to attack that high speed passenger train in August, the three Americans saving the day, and also a plot by ISIS to attack churches here in Paris in April. And so the fact that he's in this video would suggest that maybe he had a role in the planning of this attack, perhaps along with Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgium operative with ISIS in Syria.

He is a Chinese immigrant to this country, came to this country at 12 years old and really lived his dream, although he was taken from us far too soon at 32 years old. VERNI: He is the personification of a re-immigrant's dream. You know, coming into the United States I think that these are classic text book examples about that. It is just that it did lit your heart to shred to see -- I mean, clearly, any family would be affected this as well. But the way his family explains, you know, them coming over and him starting a life here and trying to better his life for himself and for his family, how giving he was, I think a lot people forget that police officers are humans. You know, we are human being. HARLOW: And that's what commissioner Bratton has been trying to say. They are all individuals like you like me. VERNI: Right. And I think he did a great job. I think he was able to bring out, and also Ramos' funeral he did the same thing, where he brought up that point and he brought out again today.

CONDOLEEZZA RICE, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We may face no greater challenge from a single country than from Iran. DICK CHENEY, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: We will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. TODD: And with the administration reinforcing its preemptive strike option, the question now: how would Iran be targeted? Retired war planner Colonel Sam Gardner developed a war gentlemen for the ""Atlantic Monthly"" magazine in 2004. He presented three options. A conventional attack on Iran's revolutionary guard, using primarily air strikes. A so-called regime change option targeting the leadership. COL. SAM GARDNER, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET): Special operations would probably come from Afghanistan, maybe come from Azerbaijan. And then the bulk of the ground force would come from Iraq in this option. TODD: And what Gardner says is the most commonly discussed option, striking some of Iran's nuclear facilities. GARDNER: There would probably be about a three-day air campaign with aircraft like the B-2, cruise missiles fired from ships and aircraft. And we would go after the facilities we know about. TODD: If those hits were successful, Gardner says, Iran's nuclear capabilities would be set back a few years. Military analysts we spoke to believe a conventional attack using ground forces would be difficult because of mountainous terrain in southern and western Iran. American bases, now in neighboring Iraq, provide shorter striking distances, but any response by Iran might tax already-thin U.S. combat units. KEN ROBINSON, MILITARY INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: The Iranians can do the math. They see that we're tied down in Iraq, they see that we're tied down in Afghanistan, they see that we're tied down in North Korea. TODD: Analysts say Iran's retaliation could be devastating, with a standing army with hundreds of thousands of troops, and an already sophisticated chemical and biological warfare program. (on camera): And that's just the immediate military response. Analysts say Iran could then wreak havoc on the world's oil supply, minding the Persian Gulf, attacking tankers, all but cutting off the supply not only to U.S. and its allies, but also to countries like China, which could then bring about its own economic retaliation against the United States.

1590847,1906014,CNN,New Day,"CNN political commentator of Time Warner Cable News, Errol Louis. Great to have you guys. OK. So Donald Trump says that he feels like he's running against two parties. You can understand why. With everything he's said about trade, Maggie, some Republicans are not comfortable with his policy on that among other things. MAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: He's made a massive departure from Republican orthodoxy on business and on trade n two speeches this week, one in New Hampshire, one in Pennsylvania. The problem for Trump has been he does need party unity here. So he's basically making a gamble that it's not going to get that much better. When he makes statements like, ""I feel like I'm at war with my own party"" on the one hand, and on the other hand, you have someone like Mitch McConnell saying, you know, we need to see more from you in terms of growth, that does not help. You're right. It is true. He essential is running against the leadership of his own party. He's running against several members of his own party. He continues to keep talking about the Republican primary and his vanquished opponents. None of this helps him bring together the voters that he needs. And ultimately, that needs to be his goal. SCIUTTO: You often wonder. It sounds like a dangerous strategy, but the fact is that voters on both sides are frustrated with their party leadership. And that's why on both sides you saw outsiders, in effect, Trump and Sanders do so well. Isn't there an argument this is a smart strategy? ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Oh, there is an argument. And this is what I think the strategists, and the political scientists and eventually the historians are going to be chewing over, which is that Donald Trump appears to be continuing and extending his Republican primary strategy, that anything against the establishment will get you votes, will get you the base excited about you. And it worked to perfection in a way during the primary season. However, you know, there are another hundred million people who are going to weigh in now. And many of them don't really care for those talking points, don't -- were not sitting to wait and hear somebody bash Mitch McConnell. That's not really what it's about for a lot of independent voters a lot of the swing state voters. We'll see whether or not that works. CAMEROTA: Exhibit A, let me submit a new FOX News poll out just two days ago. It finds that his support among Republican voters has dropped. In May it was 82 percent. Mitt Romney got more, of course. But now, in June, 74 percent. So maybe this strategy is not working, Maggie. HABERMAN: Right. I mean, this is my argument for why I think that this ongoing war with your own party is problematic. And I think people within his party and leadership are waiting for him to stop doing that.",0.0903444752590862,2016-07-01

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEMON: Tonight, 35 states are seeing spikes in coronavirus. The U.S. is reporting nearly 60,000 new cases on Wednesday. And the crisis is front and center in the dueling town halls tonight. Stark contrast, though, between President Trump and the former vice president, Joe Biden, in how to respond to this pandemic. Let's discuss now with CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner. He is the director of the cardiac catheterization lab at George Washington University Hospital. Doctor, good to see you once again. So, President Trump is repeating a false claim about masks tonight, refusing to answer whether he supports herd immunity. Meanwhile, we heard from Chris Christie, spent seven days in the ICU after contracting COVID, he released a statement that reads in part, and I quote here. ""I was wrong. I was wrong to not wear a mask at the Amy Coney Barrett announcement. And I was wrong not to wear a mask at my multiple debate prep sessions with the president and the rest of the team. I hope that my experience shows my fellow citizens that you should follow CDC guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others."" Wow! Nothing at all like that we heard from the president. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST, DIRECTOR OF CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION PROGRAM AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY: Right. It sounds like Governor Christie had an awakening. You know, you see this sometimes in people after a hospital stay. They re-evaluate where they've been and where they want to go. And a lot of what he said actually touched me. It sounded sort of both humble and angry at the same time when he started talking about how, you know, he believed he'd be safe at the White House but he wasn't, you know, he should have worn a mask when he went to the SCOTUS announcement, he should have worn a mask at the debate prep. He sounded like he had been betrayed, that he had been told that it was safe and it wasn't. It was sort of a confession. It was, it was -- the tone of the statement was what we all hoped we would hear from the president's VIP suite at Walter Reed when he was recovering, telling the country that, you know, I'm glad I'm getting better, but let me tell you that this is no joke, we need to protect ourselves, we need to wear masks, we need to social distance, don't let this happen to you. We didn't get that from the president. We got this (INAUDIBLE). We sort of did get this from Governor Christie, so good for him. LEMON: The president was asked about Christie's comments tonight.

Revealing key details about just how security broke down at Clinton correctional facility in upstate, New York. Sweat says he and Richard Matt actually practiced their escape the night before they broke out of prison. He says they reached a manhole but decided it was not isolated enough. So they picked a different manhole on the night of the real escape. Following this for us with all of the new details, national correspondent Jason Carroll. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: John and Christine, David Sweat's condition has been upgraded to fair and he is telling investigators a lot, filling in many details about the escape, telling investigators that he was the, quote/unquote, ""mastermind"" of the whole escape plan and that falls in step from what we are hearing from a source who tells me that David Sweat had a reputation at the prison of being somewhat technically minded and the smarter of the two. He also said they did a dry run the night before and they had been planning this up to six months. They only used those hacksaw blades to cut a hole in the prison wall and through a pipe to lead them to freedom. He also talked about who was involved and who was not involved -- meaning Joyce Mitchell, he says, was involved. She was supposed to be the getaway driver. But Gene Palmer, that prison guard here, the one who smuggled in that piece of frozen hamburger meat -- well, according to David sweat, he says Palmer knew nothing of the escape plan. Also, someone is coming to his defense. His mother who says her son is not the only one to blame for the breakout.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REBECCA MACKINNON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After 14 days, the search for Chinese fighter pilot Wang Wei has been called off: China's state-controlled media eulogizing him as a martyr, a revolutionary hero, a patriot who gave his life to protect his motherland. People were shown on state TV calling Wang Wei a model for China's youth, the kind of person who will build a strong China. The Chinese government is rejecting claims made by U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that Wang Wei caused the April 1 collision by losing control when he flew too close to the U.S. EP-3 surveillance plane. State television called his comments irresponsible and false. It quoted a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson who said: ""We have enough evidence to prove that it was the U.S. plane that violated flight rules by suddenly veering in a wide angle at the Chinese plane in normal flight, rammed into and damaged it, resulting in the loss of the Chinese pilot. These facts are manifest. And we have irrefutable evidence that the U.S. side cannot deny.""",0.0761373464798477,2001-04-14

BLACKWELL: Dr. Anthony Fauci says Omicron will become dominant in the U.S. New studies reveal how well current vaccines work with the variant. And Pfizer has announced the results of its study on their pill to treat COVID. A potential breakthrough in the pandemic is ahead. CAMEROTA: And the struggle to pick up the pieces continues in Kentucky. We are on the ground with the latest on the recovery there. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAMEROTA: It's been exactly one year since the first vaccine was administered in the U.S. And since then, more than 200 million Americans have gotten fully vaccinated. But, tragically, almost 800,000 Americans have died from COVID since the beginning of the pandemic. BLACKWELL: Now, there's a new study out of South Africa that gives us new insight into Omicron. And Pfizer is working on a new pill to treat COVID-19 that Dr. Fauci calls a lifesaver. Here's CNN's Alexandra Field. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER TO PRESIDENT BIDEN: It is going to be dominant in the United States, given its doubling time. ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dr. Fauci competent now the more transmissible Omicron variant will become dominant. A new study out of South Africa shows the Pfizer vaccine is only about 33 percent effective against infection with the Omicron variant, but infections do appear less severe. FAUCI: The vaccines that we use, the regular two-dose mRNA, don't do very well against infection itself. But, with hospitalization, particularly if you get the boost, it's pretty good. FIELD: A year to the day after the U.S. saw some of the first shots in arms, Pfizer announcing another leap forward in the fight against COVID. DR. ALBERT BOURLA, CEO, PFIZER: With this pill, we are expecting that, instead of 10 people going to hospital, only one will go, and, actually, no one is dying. FIELD: It's still pending authorization, but Pfizer says their antiviral pill could be available in the U.S. later this month, and that it appears to be effective in treating Omicron infections, which account for just 3 percent of cases sequenced in the U.S. today, according to the CDC, and Delta, which is still ravaging parts of the country. DR. CHRIS PERNELL, PUBLIC HEALTH PHYSICIAN: It's still Delta that's nothing out lives, with more than 1,000 deaths daily and more than 100,000 cases. That's where we have got to put the brunt of the focus in how to get unvaccinated folks vaccinated and how to get those who are vaccinated boosted.

COOPER: Large numbers of Israeli ground troops had not entered South Lebanon. Captain Boaz was targeting Katyusha rocket positions. BOAZ: Every time that Hezbollah engages fire we have to respond.

We just want peace and quiet. COOPER (voice-over): Today, exactly two weeks into the crisis, there's anything but peace and quiet. Captain Boaz and his men are in the exact same spot, though their mission has only gotten more complicated. (on camera) They've been firing shells pretty consistently now for the last hour. What they're -- what they're trying to do is not only target Hezbollah rocket positions on the ground in South Lebanon. They're also trying to provide air cover for Israeli troops fighting Hezbollah.

If this is true, that he's say ing that Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States again, I could find it disastrous for his presidency. Very few Republicans on Capitol Hill want to be hitched to a guy who thinks that Barack Obama was you know, born in a foreign land.

PRESTON: You know, it's very difficult to understand what's going on inside President Trump's mind. But remember, he's the President of the United States. He has an incredible amount of power.

It must be done in a way that doesn't pit one group of people against another. BASH: But Mr. Bush also used his short statement to advocate the very position that many in his own party say is akin to amnesty for illegal immigrants and vowed to defeat. BUSH: Part of enforcing our borders is to have a guest worker program that encourages people to register their presence so that we know who they are. BASH: The president's support for allowing illegal workers the chance to obtain temporary visas and stay in the U.S. has always pitted him against many Republicans. Yet, not long after his 2004 re- election, a visibly confident president argued he could use his self- described political capital to fight GOP opponents on the issue. BUSH: Legislation and I look forward to working. You asked me what my tactics are. I'm going to find supporters on The Hill and move it. BASH: But back then he had a 55 percent approval rating. Now it is nearly 20 points lower. The ports controversy showed many Republicans are now not afraid of challenging the struggling president. Immigration threatens to be another internal GOP mine field. NORMAN ORNSTEIN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Difficult as the immigration bill is to bring up at any time, this is not a good time for the president. His leverage is at its low point probably in his presidency with his own party. He's got a group of nervous Republicans looking ahead to a possibly disastrous election. BASH: A senior official said the president had been eager to fight conservatives for a measure he's pushed since coming to office. But now that aide admits the White House is in no position to ""agitate."" (END VIDEOTAPE) BASH: And one big political concern here and at the Republican National Committee is that GOP opposition to the president's guest worker program will anger Hispanic voters that the Bush team has worked very hard to court and actually made significant gains with in the last election -- Lou. DOBBS: Of course that is one of the difficult issues with the presidential strategy, the assumption that Hispanic U.S. citizens are the -- of exactly the same view as Hispanic non-citizens. BASH: Certainly, that is absolutely not the case -- it's not in all cases, as you -- as you just alluded to. But I think the feeling among Republicans, particularly those who have been working to court Hispanic voters, is that more often than not, they do agree with the president on this immigration issue -- Lou. DOBBS: And to put it in clearer and what is obviously stark contrast, the president's position, the president's program puts in absolutely an antithetical position to the House leadership, controlled by the Republican Party, obviously, and the Senate leadership, controlled obviously by the president's party.

Sanjay joins us this morning. Sanjay, let's dive right in. Ellen from Tunnel Hill, Georgia, writes ""my friend claims that drinking a gallon of water daily will flush the fat out of your body, resulting in weight loss. Is this true?"" DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Oh, Ellen, I wish it were true. Unfortunately it's not. It's absolutely not true. The only way to really lose some of that weight is to actually burn more calories than you consume. It's sort of a simple formula there. Part of that is going to be exercise. And if you're exercising you want to drink as much water as possible. That's going to be important to stay hydrated. Let me give you another tip there. A gallon of water, I don't know if your friend is a woman or a man that's too much overall. For women, two to three quarts probably enough, men, three to four quarts depending on your overall size, but just drinking the water alone, Ellen, probably not going to do much for you. ROBERTS: All right. And another question to answer, this one comes from Joyce in Charlottesville, Virginia, down there at the University of Virginia. ""I'm prone to mosquito bites and any other insect bites whether I spread DEET on my jeans or not. What is the best deterrent and also the best relief for these irritating itches after a bug bite?"" GUPTA: This is the time of the year when a lot of people start asking questions like this. You mentioned one of the substances that actually typically does work, DEET is one of them, pecaradin is another substance that can offer some relief. Your best bet if you're particularly prone to this is to try and stay away from wooded areas that have a lot of bushes for example as well, and also look is look at your shampoo and your soap. If they're heavily scented those can be very attractive to all sorts of biting creatures and stay away from standing water. That's where they like to breed and hang out. Now, as far as what works. If you do get bit there are several different products out there - anti-histamines for example, that takes away that sort of swelling that often accompanies those itches. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen will take away some of the pain. Topical creams, you can carry some of these with you, hydrocortisone cream, for example, will help almost immediately and skin protectants will soothe the skin, oatmeal, baking soda as well. John. ROBERTS: We got time for one more question today, Jamal in Denver asks ""we will be having our first baby in August, what is the ideal room temperature suitable for a baby?""

MARY JO MITCHELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Thank you. ROESGEN: Yeah, it looks great. You're in the mood, you're in the spirit. MITCHELL: You can't come to the derby without a hat. And as far as the queen's hat goes, I've heard maybe red and blue, maybe with white feathers, the colors of the British flag? Who knows? We'll have to wait and see. But, yes they are anxiously anticipating the queen's arrival here in Louisville. She will be here tomorrow -- [ inaudible ] a lot of horses her whole life. She's actually been in Kentucky a few times in the past. Never attended the derby. It has been one of her lifelong dreams to come here. So she will be here tomorrow indeed. In preparation for that visit, some of the workers have actually had to take some etiquette classes on how to deal with the queen should they come into contact with her. Things like do not touch her unless she, of course, holds out her hands. And you may touch her then. But do not touch her, do not mock her accent. Just speak in your normal speaking voice. A bow is appropriate even though we are not technically her subjects and she is to be called her majesty. So there have been lots of preparations put in place even with the staff here anticipating the queen's arrival. Susan? ROESGEN: Mary Jo I know that people stay in the infield. I've never been to the derby, but I understand if you can't get one of the good seats up in the stands, you're in the infield. Do you know where the queen will be? Will she be behind you up in the glassed in suites? MITCHELL: I can tell you she will not be in the infield, that's for sure. But she will probably be somewhere -- I don't know if you can see behind me where the twin spires are, she'll be just to the left of that, I am told, either on the fourth, fifth, or sixth floor. So we're not exactly sure where her location will be but that's where she'll be watching the race from -- high atop the infields. I guarantee you, she won't be down there. ROESGEN: And does she actually bet? Does someone go and place her bets for her? MITCHELL: There will be people made available for that we're told, if she does want to make a bet. She won't have to go to the betting window herself, someone will be there to take care of that for her.

However, if you are the Democrats, you do know, you do know you have that giant pool of votes that we just talked about in Dekalb County. And you know, Nick Valencia says they're behind the scenes working. I'm sure the pressure has been relayed to them about what is happening that the Republicans have pulled out big leads and that they have been stuck at 37 percent for a long time. We know these people are exhausted. They went through November. Now they're having a special election. We get that. But there is an accountability question here as to how you are stuck at 37 percent for so long. And what Martin Savidge just says, they did jump from 40 to 69 percent. The question is, how much higher can they get in an area that is absolutely critical to the Democrats. And it's interesting when you look at this. Sixty percent for Jon Ossoff, 67 as well. Sixty-one percent if you round up for Raphael Warnock. If you go back to the presidential race, 59 percent. So, percentage-wise, percentage-wise they're running about the same. One of the interesting questions will be as we get closer to the finish line is you see the number of votes here. Seventy-eight thousand votes for Joe Biden to win Chatham County back in November. We come back to where we are now, only at 70 percent. So, we don't know exactly where we are yet, but turn-out is down. We knew turn out would be down. It's not a presidential election, but the question will be as we get closer to the finish line, is it down evenly, meaning down by about the same proportions of Democratic counties than Republican counties or did Republicans, you know, turn out a little bit more? Did Democrats turn out a little bit more? That's one of the questions we'll be asking as we get into tomorrow and beyond. You count them right now, 82,000, Wolf, that's the number that's concerning to Democrats right now. Even though you know, you're absolutely right. There are votes here. But we're up to 95 percent in Fulton County now, 95 percent. So, you're going to get more votes here, but you are up to 95 percent of the estimated vote. This is the giant wild card right now. Any hopes of a Democratic comeback, they need a giant report here. As you start to move around, 89 percent, some more, there is math, there is math to be had here. And so, I keep coming back to this. The estimate is what is the final vote total, right? So now you're at 1.8, 1.7. 3.5, add up, you're a little higher than that. Getting closer to 3.6 percent. The estimate is there's four million votes cast out there. So, we had more votes to count. BLITZER: Dekalb County, let's take a look at what it is right now.

(END AUDIO CLIP) TARINI PARTI, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, BUZZFEED NEWS: I thought the president's defense was very interesting because when I was in Iowa talking to farmers, the ones who are still supporting the president, what they pointed out was, you know, he said he's going to take on China and he's doing it for us. We're going to have some, you know, negative impact in the short term but in the long term, he's doing what he said and that's what -- that's exactly what he said in the radio interview that I'm the one taking on China. If not me, who else? And that's something that his base at least feels very comfortable with. BASH: And there's another issue that is really splitting the president from most Republicans on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, and that is the Ukraine. Sources say the White House is considering blocking $250 million in military assistance earmarked for that country. Now most Republicans view a strong Ukraine as a big check on Russia and Vladimir Putin's influence in the investment as a deterrent for Putin expanding power to Ukraine. So that is another issue. And the president said today on other issues that it's pretty clear that he has taken Putin's side maybe not today as much as at the G7 on the issue of the Ukraine. MARGARET TALEV, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. And I think on this issue we're going to need to hear more from the president or perhaps even better John Bolton or both of them on their thinking as this goes forward. There may be some China implications to this foreign policy kind of calculus here, but as it relates to Russia, and it clearly does, whether that's the intent or not, there are a lot of Republicans in Congress as well as the American people as well as the national security advisor who were not particularly comfortable with a stance that is too generous towards Russia right now. BASH: Can you imagine if a Democratic president said I'm just going to, you know, think about taking military assistance away from Ukraine which effectively means empowering Vladimir Putin, what Republicans would do? HULSE: Yes. I mean, I think people on the Hill would go again with the Russians, what is the deal? And I think this is an issue where they have consistently pushed back against the president. Mitch McConnell doesn't like the Moscow Mitch nickname and part of his pushback against that is look at how hard I've been on Russia over the years. I think the president is going to run into real trouble. TALEV: They have put him in a box already, I read about that. HULSE: On this, yes. BASH: Yes. All right, everybody, stand by.

In the past few days, the storyline has gone from the dad, Craig Vandewege, coming home from his job at Costco to finding this tragedy, then to the dad hiring an attorney and refusing to cooperate with police. And now the dad is under arrest for capital murder in the gruesome deaths. This blockbuster comes after detectives returned to the crime scene and removed evidence from the Ft. Worth home. They even took the back door of the house with them. The details of the Vandewege arrest are even more dramatic after he`s pulled over for speeding in Colorado, where his wife and baby were being buried.

1377451,1691825,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"We do have a video. There was no video of the actual encounter between Officer Wilson and Michael Brown. There was no gunshot here. This was a physical altercation. I think it's also worth pointing out, you know, we are often referring to the illegal chokehold. The chokehold is against New York City police department policy now. It's not a crime. It's not against the law. Officers are not allowed to use it and they can be disciplined for it but it's not a crime against New York State law. BALDWIN: When it comes to a grand jury as we learned in Ferguson, it's either you indict or you don't indict, correct? TOOBIN: Right. And the standard is much lower than a criminal trial facing the decision of a verdict. BALDWIN: Explain the standard for me. TOOBIN: In New York State, and in Missouri, is there probable cause for this -- was there probable cause that a defendant committed a crime. ""No"" was the answer in both states. If the case went to trial, the higher standard to meet is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. BALDWIN: What's your reaction to the decision? TOOBIN: Again, I think it's surprising. This was an encounter about a very minor crime. Eric Garner was selling so-called ""loosies,"" loose cigarettes -- BALDWIN: Single cigarettes. TOOBIN: Right, individual cigarettes. Not pot. Actual cigarettes. They're not taxed. And the store owners in the area don't like it so they ask the cops to tell people to knock this off. This was what Eric Garner was arrested for. A very, very minor crime. The confrontation escalated and there were arms around his neck and he died. I do think this was a surprising decision. I didn't hear all of the evidence in the grand jury. I didn't hear the officer's testimony. I don't want to say this was clearly an incorrect decision. Given the facts available and given the fact that Eric Garner did very little wrong, if anything wrong, a very minor crime, wound up dying, it's surprising. BALDWIN: My guests, to my right, share that same reaction as you. Jeff Toobin, thank you so much. We're showing you live pictures. This is where this whole thing happened here in New York where you see the video of the officer surrounding him. This is the very street.

Perhaps quietly -- in the quiet and drizzle and cold of New York reflecting on what happens. And the big question is, what happens from here on out?

Stephen Hawking inspired millions of people around the world with his work. And it's My Freedom Day, a student-driven movement to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking. (END VIDEO CLIP) LU STOUT: Now, Russia's Foreign Minister is lashing out at the U.K., just as British Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to announce possible measures against Moscow over that nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Sergey Lavrov says Britain is fragrantly trying to mislead the international community, and that Moscow will not allow that to happen. Russia defied May's ultimatum for answers, and the Kremlin saying it will not respond to her allegations that Moscow helped poison Sergei Skripal until it gets samples of the nerve agent for its own analysis. We are following the latest from both Moscow and London. Sam Kiley is in Moscow. Nick Paton Walsh is at the British Parliament. And, Nick, let's go to you first. Theresa May, she is expected to come in shortly. What is she expected to say? How is she expected to act against Russia? NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the pressure is on, really, for some sort of measures that act immediately that Russia feels the bite of today, rather than potentially after court challenges or other issues moving forward. Now, there a possibility that diplomats will find themselves expelled, but that's something that Russia can simply retaliate by retaliating equal number of British diplomats. We have heard though from the British foreign office that they wish to call an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, as soon as possible, in which they will use that meeting to brief the other members of what has occurred here in the United Kingdom in Salisbury, of their allegation that a nerve agent, Novichok was used to try and kill Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Now, of course, we all know, Russia has a veto at the United Nations Security Council, so we might see a resolution of a description and this is presumably Britain's bid to elevate the situation to a higher international level to enforce their message of quite how seriously they take this. Remember, Theresa May referred to the use of a nerve agent on British soil as an unlawful act of force by Russia, and certainly the deadline that they gave them of midnight last night, just about 12 hours from -- before when I speak now, Russia overtly flouted, saying they had no interest in responding to that at all.

BLITZER: Let's talk first of all about the CIA destroying videotapes of what are described as very harsh interrogation techniques of two -- at least two Al Qaida suspects. And Senator Feinstein, I'll begin with you. Was a crime, in your opinion, based on what you know right now, potentially -- potentially -- committed? FEINSTEIN: Based on what I know now, it was a big mistake. Whether it's a crime or not, I think we're going to have to find. Senator Rockefeller, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has announced that we will be doing an investigation and holding hearings. And I think it's important to know exactly what the tapes were -- there's a lot of speculation -- exactly why they were made, who gave the order to make them, who gave the order to destroy them, and exactly why this was done. I don't buy the answer, it was for the protection of the CIA. And I don't buy it for technical reasons that I can't go into here. BLITZER: All right. We'll talk about that in a moment. You'll tell us what you can tell us. But let me ask the same question to Senator Kyl. Was a crime potentially committed here? KYL: I know of no statute or other reason why anyone would suspect that a crime was committed. And it may not... BLITZER: Well, let me give you a couple examples. For example... KYL: OK. It may not have been a good idea, but that's different from a crime. Go ahead. BLITZER: If there were court hearings or there were legal proceedings against suspects and defense attorneys asked for any videotapes and were told in their discovery process there were no videotapes, would -- potentially that could be a crime. KYL: The only instance in which the news has reported there were requests from a court dealt with other suspects, not the two suspects that were the subject of the interrogation that was taped, apparently. So, at least insofar as the news story about the Moussaoui case is concerned, that would not be applicable here. BLITZER: What about the 9/11 Commission, a presidential commission approved by Congress, they asked for videotapes and they were told that there were no videotapes, potentially. Is that perjury? KYL: I don't know what they specifically asked for or what they were told. There are conflicting news accounts of that here, and so I agree with Senator Feinstein that when the Justice Department and the CIA and, perhaps, Congress conducts its investigation, we'll find out what the facts are. BLITZER: So I assume, Senator Kyl, you don't agree with Senator Biden who said earlier today he would like to see a special counsel named by the new attorney general to go ahead and investigate? KYL: You know, the Department of Justice, the Central Intelligence Agency, and congressional committees will be looking into this.

Whoa. We the jury find George Zimmerman not guilty. A very calm Zimmerman shook the hands of his attorneys and that was it. It was over. But outside the courthouse, the reaction was just beginning. Social media absolutely lit up. Protests erupted nationwide as we mentioned for the most part peaceful. This was one of more than 1,000 fatal shootings in the state of Florida in 2012. It happened last February. So what made this a national news story instead of a local tragedy? Many people argue it's merely the latest example of deep seed racism in the justice system. Joining me now for this discussion, former president of Morehouse College, Dr. Robert Franklin and also cnn.com columnist Ruben Navarette, and author of ""Dear White America,"" Tim Weis. So I want to welcome all of you to this and all of your voices, and Dr. Franklin sitting in here with me in studio. It's nice to see you again, sir. ROBERT FRANKLIN, FORMER PRESIDENT, MOREHOUSE COLLEGE: Thank you. BALDWIN: I want to begin with you because you have guided many Morehouse men in your years. I know because of this and in talking to colleagues of mine, African-American colleagues, who have sons and nephews, this case has sort of reignited talks, call it the talk. FRANKLIN: Yes. BALDWIN: Right? FRANKLIN: Yes. BALDWIN: With very young, young men about whether it's how fast you should be walking in public, what you should be wearing. I don't know if it's Morehouse specific about the five wells. What is that? FRANKLIN: At Morehouse and at all of America's black colleges our schools, churches and community organizations have promoted what I've conceptualized as the five wells. Our young people should be well read, well spoken, well traveled, well-dressed and well balanced. It is very important that they comport themselves in a way that doesn't threaten. But it is a pity that they have to do that, that they can't be taken for who they are and seen as average, ordinary kids. But we do emphasize the importance of presenting themselves as young leaders, as cultivated and dignified and responsible. That certainly has been core to the Morehouse tradition. BALDWIN: I have to say, obviously I can't relate to that, but I've talked to a lot of people who obviously can. And my question to sort of push you gently then would be, would that not imply that if a young black man is walking along the street and they see a white man, that that is inherently the stereotyping, perhaps, the white man to be profiling the black man? Is that fair? FRANKLIN: It's not fair and it's a tragedy when we profile one way or the other.

Waiting for her own results, Dr. Newman says, has given her a much better understanding of what patients like Dawn go through. As a young surgeon in Brooklyn, New York, Lisa Newman noticed something alarming in her patients. NEWMAN: It was just heartbreaking every day in the clinic to continuously be seeing African-American women that seem to be disproportionately afflicted with breast cancers at younger ages and more advanced stages of disease. O'BRIEN: And even worse, this cancer was a different, more aggressive type. It's called triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC. The statistics are appalling. Black women are twice as likely as white women to get TNBC. Why so deadly? When breast cancer is diagnosed, doctors look for three markers that show where the cancer is most vulnerable and help determine how best to fight it. But the markers aren't there with triple negative breast cancer, making this type of cancer very difficult to treat and more likely to return. (on camera): So you really have no really targeted way to fight triple negative breast cancer. NEWMAN: That's correct at this point in time. That's correct in terms of standard of care. Chemotherapy is all that's available. O'BRIEN (voice-over): A little know killer. With black women squarely in its sights. Lisa Newman knew she had to help. So she began her pioneering work to learn more about the disease, to help all women struggling with TNBC and the black women it most affects. SPENCER: How do you little kangaroo. O'BRIEN: Women like Dawn Spencer. SPENCER: And we all live happily together. NEWMAN: Dawn is one of the most heroic, wonderful, beautiful women I've ever met. O'BRIEN: Looking at Dawn, you'd never guess she's sick. SPENCER: It is not a death sentence. It doesn't have to be. Everything has a reason. Everything that I think about now has more meaning than it did before. O'BRIEN: Dawn is a hard-charging sales executive at CBS radio. Her life changed forever in 2002. She was 47 years old.

This time, the cancer was triple negative, harder to fight, harder to survive. The cancer spread to the rest of Dawn's breast and beyond. Dr. Newman operated again.

GONZALES: Yes, I took it out of the glove box. And that was about 8:30 that I read the restraining order to them. Because, at that time, I was looking for them to go to find the children (UNINTELLIGIBLE) when I finally located them. GRACE: You mean, at the amusement park? GONZALES: That`s correct. GRACE: Let me go to chief of police in Castle Rock, Colorado. Joining us now is Tony Lane. Welcome, Mr. Lane. Mr. Lane, Chief, why didn`t you just send a cruiser over there? I know you say it was out of your jurisdiction, in Denver jurisdiction. Why didn`t you just send a cruiser over there? She told you where he was with her children. TONY LANE, CASTLE ROCK CHIEF OF POLICE: Well, that`s not totally accurate. We did send two police cars over, not one, but two, which actually that night we had four cars on duty. GRACE: To the amusement park? LANE: No, we sent them to Jessica`s house to take a report. We did not know what the situation was when the call came into the dispatcher other than the kids were missing. And as far as we were concerned, we had three missing children that were probably with the father, but we wanted to confirm that. GRACE: Well, since there was a restraining order, was it really up to you or the police to decide what to do? The judge had issued a restraining order because of atrocious behavior by Simon, including trying to hang himself in front of his girls. LANE: Well, Nancy, this information was not known to the officers at the time that they took this report. GRACE: Did they know there was a restraining order? LANE: They knew later on that there was a restraining order. The dispatcher knew there was a restraining order. The officers never saw a restraining order initially when they went to Jessica`s house. They took the information. Like I said, two officers responded and then they divided the town up into two districts and they started looking for Simon`s truck, for the girls, for confirmation that the girls were with their father. We had no, at that point, probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed. He had... GRACE: Well, what about the violation of the restraining order itself? I mean, what good is a TPO or a restraining order if they`re not enforced?

He motivates Democrats to come out and vote. And what we see among in Virginia is not very motivating for your decision about. Look at that, feelings about Donald Trump, 51% of likely voters in Virginia said that yes, he is very motivating for them to come out and vote. Compare that to Joe Biden, it just 48%. I've never seen that before. You know, I love old polls. You know, I love going through the archives, the idea that a former president would more motivating for voters to come out and vote than the current president. It's bizarro land. And what's truly bizarre is if you look at a slightly different question, which is essentially how big of a factor is Trump in your choice for Virginia governor? Look at that, 41% of voters say yes now compared to 2017 when it was 43%. There's no drop off, it's the same he's still a factor in voter's minds. COOPER: What type of voters can -- I think they can hear you in Virginia tonight. What kind of voters -- I mean can Youngkin win over some voters that the former President couldn't and what might that mean nationally for midterms and beyond? ENTEN: Yes, I don't know if I necessarily need the microphone for this. I probably yell loud enough that each viewer can hear me in their own home. Look, it's white voters with a college degree. Look at the net favorability ratings among white voters with a college degree among Youngkin versus Trump and look at white voters without a college degree. Among white college voters, Youngkin is basically even. Look at Trump at minus 16 points. That's a 16 point difference. Youngkin is basically holding the white non-college base that Trump got look at that just a two point difference. They're both quite popular among them. And I think the question is, is what Glenn Youngkin doing in Virginia able to translate nationally, because what we've seen in the Trump era is white voters without -- with a college degree, excuse me, moving away from the Republican Party. Look at that, in 2012, Romney won white college voters by eight points. It was time in 2016 then Biden won by eight, Republicans want to get those voters back. And if Glenn Youngkin is able to win on Tuesday on the strength of white college -- white voters with a college degree, it could provide the roadmap for Republicans going forward post Trump. COOPER: And that -- I mean, the school issue is something that obviously Glenn Youngkin has really seized on and to great effect. ENTEN: Absolutely, absolutely.

There's obviously the positioning for blame. And then you also have -- I mean, we are 14 1/2 hours out from a government shutdown. And I do think that Democrats and Republicans are both concerned about the political consequences for themselves over this. So, I think you have a little bit of the positioning for blame.

For 48 hours a family of 14, including 11 children, have survived, huddled together, clinging to the branches of this tree. Today at last, help was at hand. We filmed as the pilot of a South African search and rescue helicopter maneuvered carefully closer to the tree. Suddenly, they spot one of the children, a young boy, struggling in the water. He had been blown off the tree by the downdraft of the helicopter. But the wind, the current, and the panic-stricken child makes this a difficult rescue. The boy is drifting away in danger of drowning. He is saved just in time. It is simply one more example of the extraordinary work being done by the helicopter crews here. Saving lives here is a hazardous business. This family's house is collapsing around them, as the water levels rise. And there is now a desperation about the rescues here because time is running out. For eight hours today, this crew was plucking people from the flood, stopping only to refuel their helicopter.

You had people out there saying, you know, they should all quit. They should just stand up and say, you know what, I'm done. Well, you know, that's a nice theoretical thing to say and it's a nice principal point to make but it's a lot harder for these anchors who, you know, these days those jobs are tough to find. If they say I won't do it, they'll be celebrated by some, they'll be lionized by many in a particular community but they also may lose their jobs. And so, you know, you are putting them in a difficult spot to have to make that choice and particularly many on the left sort of demanding of them to say don't say it, if they say you have to say it, then quit. You can understand the sentiment but, boy, that's a tough spot to put all of these anchors in. COOPER: David, I mean the president's tweet in support of Sinclair today, it basically -- I'm not sure it helps Sinclair with what its trying to accomplish. I mean Sinclair is saying, you know, this isn't about left or right, this is us just expressing our values of being fair. I'm not sure the president weighing in on the side of Sinclair while trashing, you know, CNN and NBC and others really helps their point. FOLKENFLIK: Well, and it's hard to look at this controversy over these statements being read aloud by anchors. In the absence of thinking about how Sinclair handles themselves both on the air and off the air. You know, they are now in 190 stations, they're looking to take over more than 30 more from Tribune Media in a deal that's getting scrutinized down in Washington.

It could eventually make million more doses each month. (on camera): The pandemic has all but destroyed Cuba's economy. Beaches that usually would be full of tourists are now empty. The vaccine though could help change Cuba's fortunes as researchers here say they can produce enough to sell overseas, and even market vaccination vacations. Offering the vaccine to tourists as a way to restart the Cuban tourism industry. (voice over): It may seem unbelievable that a poor island where there are shortages of food and basic medicines, like painkillers and antibiotics can create a cutting edge vaccine. But Cuba has produced its own vaccine going back decades. Cuban scientists say the same U.S. sanctions that isolated the island forced Cuba to become a biomedical pioneer. Cuba has been following established protocols in providing updates on their vaccine development, international observers say -- ""This is very good news and we are following these results carefully,"" he said. First because the Cuban population will directly benefit from their vaccine candidates and this at some point could control the transmission in the country. Cuban scientists say the island likely could not afford to import vaccines from abroad. And pursuit multiple vaccine candidates in case some do not pass the trials. If Cuba ends up with more than one working vaccine it could allow doctors a greater arsenal to wipe out the coronavirus here. DR. TANIA CROMBET, CUBAN SCIENTIST: I also think that at the end, we might be able to implement what we call, prime and boost, which is using some vaccines for the first doses, and then boostering (ph) -- (INAUDIBLE) with the second vaccine candidate in order to enhance the previous one.

The hackers have released personal cellphone and email addresses of Democratic House numbers. They also targeted Democratic aides and released some login information for the Congressional campaign committee. An earlier hack of the Democratic National Committee ahead of the party's national convention forced the resignation of chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and three other top officials.

So how exactly are they able to keep the candidates safe? Here's CNN's Brian Todd. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In the middle of Hillary Clinton's rally, a protester rushed the stage. The Secret Service quickly responded. The woman was subdued and hustled out. In March, a man rushed Donald Trump's podium in Dayton, Ohio. Trump was startled. The agents quickly handled the situation. This year the challenge of protecting candidates has reached new heights from a man using suction cups to climb Trump Tower, to two party conventions with fence jumpers and other security headaches. And a multitude of candidates who attract passionate crowds. At a Bernie Sanders' event in California he was rushed by several people. What is that moment like for a Secret Service agent? LARRY JOHNSON, FORMER SECRET SERVICE SECRETARY AGENT IN CHARGE: You want to get between them and the protectee, and cover their hands and make sure you've got an area to touch and reach and feel for anything inside of a coat or a jacket. TODD: Former Secret Service agents tell us at that moment, one or two agents have to go to the threat, and take down that person. Another agent secures the candidate, and other agents immediately check for other threats.

Thousands of Yazidi girls and women taken from their homes and families, used as sex slaves by ISIS fighters.

Let's start broadly and then get into the specifics of the delusion that makes this OK in the minds of ISIS and others. What is happening? DR. QANTA AHMED, AUTHOR, ""IN THE LAND OF INVISIBLE WOMEN"": This report has uncovered extraordinary bureaucracy, systemized human trafficking of women and girls.

They complain they would only have one question. They complained it would be pre-screened. But, as you saw, Brian, as I saw and as the country saw, people who oppose President Obama's gun agenda were able to stand up there right in front of him and press their points with the president. What more could you ask for? They didn't ask any follow up questions. They could have pressed him harder. I asked CNN if they would have been allowed to ask follow- ups, CNN said there was no prohibition on follow-ups. I don't know, I don't know if you -- how can you ask for a better forum than that if you want to criticize President Obama on gun restrictions. Instead, you know, the NRA took to Twitter, which is a cowardly move. STELTER: And FOX News, a friendlier forum, perhaps for their argument. S.E., do you think the NRA's strategy here is a wise one? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The NRA has no incentive to sit in a town hall and be lectured to by a president who thinks they are the problem and by extension, the law-abiding gun owners that the NRA represents, are the problem. Democrats running for president at a debate recently called out the NRA as an enemy they are all proud to have accrued. There's no -- there's no common language here. There's no sense of respect. Why would any member or representative of the NRA think they can have an honest and open conversation about these issues when they are repeatedly told they are the problem? That makes no sense. WEMPLE: That sounds like an indictment of your employer. Are you saying that CNN did not put on an excellent event that encouraged the exchange of ideas? CUPP: CNN did a great town hall and Anderson asked some very tough questions. I've applauded the president for showing up at that debate. But the media writ large has not been friendly to the gun issue. A newspaper just after Newton published the names and addresses of law- abiding gun owners, as if we are the problem. The media has been overtly hostile on this issue. It's also been overtly and deeply disappointingly unknowledgeable. I have never seen an issue be covered by so many vocal people who know so little about guns. WEMPLE: Let's stick to the issue. (CROSSTALK) STELTER: I agree with you on that issue about lack of knowledge. Too many journalists have too little knowledge about the specifics of guns. But I have a theory I want to try out on all of you. I think if the NRA had come to that town hall, it would have been great TV. It would have been great journalism. We would have heard from them at length. Maybe the president and the NRA rep would have been going back and forth. You",0.1157126870599356,2016-01-10

NEW YORK CITY PROSECUTOR: Well I can understand, Christine, why people are very angry about this. I mean, it's millions of dollars being given to people who lost enormous amounts of money and have crippled the country but the sacredness of the contract is so important in the American business system. Think about it for a second. If you could void contracts after the fact, who would do business with AIG? Let's say you work for a company and the company has a problem and your boss comes in to you and says we're cutting your salary in half, going back in time and we want half the money back. I don't think many people would work for that company and that's the principle that we're looking at here. ROMANS: We get a lot of e-mails and viewer voice mails who say things like you know, this is criminal, this is criminal. It's not criminal what's happening here is perfectly legal with this contracts, aren't they? CALLAN: Yes. It's not criminal. It maybe disgraceful and it may be negligence particularly on the part of Congress when they enacted this legislation but it is not criminal, and I think that what Congress was looking at originally was they were nationalizing essentially AIG and they were saying how can we make sure it's a reliable company, we have to honor prior contracts. ROMANS: Let's talk about Bernie Madoff. Because now he's behind bars, his former accountant has actually been arrested and released on bail. What happens here from a legal perspective from your perspective of trying to find out who else may have helped him. Do they follow the money? CALLAN: Oh, they're going to follow the money big time. Because what happens now is the Justice Department has an asset forfeiture unit and they will swoop down now and they're going to try to find out was Madoff's accountant involved, does he have money proceeds from the fraud, does the wife have proceeds, do the sons have proceeds? ROMANS: What about that money? The sons got loans from their father and their mother over the previous years. In fact, one loan, just a couple of months before he was arrested, is that money going to be scrutinized? CALLAN: Oh, it's not only going to be scrutinized but I think there's a very good chance that that money is going to be seized by the government. Madoff, when he pled guilty said his fraud went back into the early 1990s. He lent his sons over $30 million during that time period. He used money to pay for the condo that his wife lives in. ROMANS: I hope they didn't spend all of it. I mean because they're going to be looking at it, right. I mean, they could have to forfeit this money.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BURNETT: Breaking news, Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a key witness in Trump's impeachment investigation fired. This news coming just hours after Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was pushed out of his role today. A Trump advisor described this as a flushing out the pipes, sending a message to those in the administration that siding against the President will not be tolerated, which if you take a step back is a pretty terrifying thing since these people told the truth. The witnesses who remain at their posts are George Kent at the State Department, Laura Cooper at the Defense Department, David Holmes at the embassy in Ukraine, Jennifer Williams who worked for Vice President Pence transitioning to another State Department job as well. Chief Political Correspondent, Astead Herndon, National Political Reporter for The New York Times and Ryan Lizza, Chief Washington Correspondent for Politico join me now. Thanks to all of you. So it was already - Vindman being fired and his twin brother being fired who's a lawyer for the National Security Council at the White House, his brother. And now all of a sudden Gordon Sondland who was the guy Trump loved, said he's a great guy, a million dollar donor. DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Listen, this is one of those situations where he technically - no, he officially has the right to do all of this, the President. BURNETT: Right. BASH: Of course, he does. And that was actually one of the core arguments that a lot of the people who are supporting him made about firing Marie Yovanovitch. He has a right to decide who is ambassador is and who it isn't. This is obviously a much different scale. The timing of it, he's trying to send a signal. I mean, it's not like he's being subtle here. The President is sending a signal, you mess with me, you testify against me, you can't work for me. And in some ways, you can understand if he's Donald Trump or anybody else, why would you want to have people working for you. But at the same time, you also have Republicans on Capitol Hill promising that the President learned a lesson and then now this is just another example from the rally in the East Room to several other things that he's done since he has been acquitted. BURNETT: Right. BASH: That this shows it's not a signal that he learned his lesson. BURNETT: I mean, Astead, in a sense it's terrifying because everything Dana says is true, but the reality of it is, is these people all said the same thing. You could, if you were a Republican senator, decide you didn't think it rose to the level of impeachability or you didn't think it was a big deal, but you couldn't say they all lie.

What kind of an effect is all of these extended deployments or are all of these extended deployments having on the military? STARR: Well, John, what it is doing is only underscoring the view of many that the force is simply stretched too thin. Is it at the breaking point? No. There's no indication of that, but are there pressure points now on especially the Army and Marine Corps? Absolutely. General Abizaid (ph) has now said that he is going to maintain 15 combat brigades, that's about 145,000 troops, in Iraq through early '07 next year and the only way to do that is to keep some people longer and send some people earlier. ROBERTS: We had some interesting public opinion that was measured in Iraq over the last little while. A State Department poll on whether or not U.S. forces should stay or should they go. Here's what the State Department poll found. Sixteen percent of people said they want the U.S. forces to stay until the government asks them to leave. But look at this number, 65 percent of Iraqis said that they want U.S. forces to leave immediately. Arwa Damon, why would people in Iraq want U.S. forces to leave immediately, particularly since all of the analysis and a lot of statements from people there in Iraq, senior positions in Iraq, are saying if the U.S. pulled out, the whole place would devolve into civil war almost immediately? DAMON: That's right John and really this isn't very much of a yes or no question, but if we look back to a year ago, there was mixed sentiment toward U.S. forces on the streets here and then we had the bombing of the holy shrine in Samara, the Shia shrine. After that, there was that catapulting of sectarian violence. At that point, opinion shifted towards U.S. forces. They were perceived as being the only thing that was really holding this country together and now eight months later down the road, we're just seeing an increase in sectarian violence. That could be what's pushing Iraqis now to believe that U.S. forces should leave and really though opinion is mixed. When we were out, we heard a lot more sentiment expressed in terms of yes, U.S. forces need to leave right now. They're actually the cause of the violence, but other Iraqis were also saying that they still were that semi-stabilizing force in the sense that they were the only ones from really prevented the Shia, Sunni militias from conducting all-out battle in the streets. ROBERTS: Barbara Starr, if the U.S. military has lost the Iraqi people, has it lost the war? STARR: Well, I think what U.S. military commanders are really looking at is that feeling amongst the Iraqi people because the message is very clear from every senior commander we speak to, that it is now really the Iraqi's problem.

So the strategy is one of the four things that we're reassessing to come to a decision about what we do going forward. (END VIDEO CLIP) MORGAN: That was Herman Cain today with some details of how he will reassess his campaign this weekend. And Herman Cain's attorney, Lin Wood, is back with me now exclusively. Herman Cain made it clear, Mr. Wood, that he's going to back home and talk to his wife. They haven't actually met in person since the allegations of this lengthy affair came to light. What do you imagine will be going on this weekend? Because he said he is also going to reassess whether he will continue in the race. WOOD: I think he's going to be reassessing his campaign, for the reasons and in the areas that he gave you. Herman Cain is a smart man. And he loves his family. And I know that these last four or five weeks with these accusations have taken a toll on him. And they've taken a toll on his family. I suspect he's going to have a heart to heart talk with his wife and his other family members. And he's going to make sure that whatever decision he makes, the first and foremost consideration is in their best interest. But I can tell you that I think we need to take a serious look at how this process has developed over the last several weeks, if not several campaigns. And we need to make a decision -- MORGAN: Let me ask you a question. WOOD: -- whether or not we're going to require proof or whether we're just simply going to require accusation. MORGAN: I think we're trying o get to the truth. That's the point of this, really. I mean, there is a good argument about whether a man's private sexual behavior should continue to have any relevance to a man who wants to run for presidency. That's a different issue. WOOD: Or female. MORGAN: The question now -- yes. WOOD: Yeah works both ways. We do have a female candidate too. MORGAN: I understand that. But you keep saying that there's no evidence at all. Of course, there is mounting evidence of a -- certainly a very close relationship between Herman Cain and Ginger White, so close that he has been repeatedly texting her. WOOD: Now, you are really misrepresenting the text. MORGAN: -- conversations -- WOOD: You're really misrepresenting the texts. MORGAN: Really? WOOD: Absolutely. There are 70 texts; 57 of those texts were sent by Ms. White to Mr. Cain over a four-week time period, to which he responded with 17 answers. And let's put that into perspective, too, Piers.

This measure comes two weeks after President Trump was in Saudi Arabia urging all of the gulf countries to crack down on terrorism. Let's get the latest. CNN's Muhammad Lila joins us now from Abu Dhabi in the UAE, one of the nations that has broken off ties with Qatar. This is a big deal, Muhammad. MUHAMMAD LILA, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning, John. Yes, absolutely, this is a big deal, especially to U.S. interests in the region. Look, the U.S. has a major military base in Qatar. It's part of CENTCOM or Central Command and it's home to about 10,000 American troops. Those troops are fighting in the mission against ISIS in neighboring Iraq, for example. Now, it's unclear at this moment if this move will affect the operations of the U.S. base there, but now we're talking about a dispute between key U.S. allies. Oil prices went up already this morning. And, look, some of those countries you mentioned, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE, they're all major allies. But here's the other problem, so is Qatar. The those countries are accusing Qatar of sponsoring terror groups, specifically groups like al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood. So they're closing their borders, they're closing all air space and trade with Qatar and they're telling Qataris in their countries that they have 14 days to leave. And, John, look, I don't need to tell you how volatile this region can be, but this is a big concern for the State Department. This morning this is what Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had to say about all this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE: I think what we're witnessing is a growing list of some irritants in the region that have been there for some time and obviously they have now bubbled up to a level the countries decided they needed to take action in an effort to have those differences addressed. We certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences. (END VIDEO CLIP) LILA: And Tillerson later added that the United States is willing to play a role to bring these countries together, but it's not even clear right now if these countries even want to sit at the same table. And, you know, John, a lot of people are saying, more than Qatar and more than these countries, this is actually about Iran, because some of these gulf countries have accused Qatar of not taking a hard enough line against Iran and some are saying this is what they're doing to bring Qatar back in line so they can form a unified front against Iran.

And lo and behold, a couple of hours later, Donald Trump gets to put the barest of fig leaves on the outrageous tweet about Barack Obama wiretapping. Now, by the way, incidental collection and wiretapping of the Trump Tower have absolutely nothing to do with each other, but guys like me are forced to spend time explaining that to people because of what happened yesterday. BLITZER: The president that was apparently conducting an interview with Time Magazine asked Chairman Nunes who was providing his update yesterday, and this is what the president's reaction was in the Time Magazine interview. And I'll put it up on the screen. ""Oh, this just came out. This is a Politico story. Members of the Donald Trump Transition Team possibly, including Trump himself, were under surveillance during the Obama administration following November's election. House Intelligence Chairman, Devin Nunes, told reporters -- wow. Nunes said, so that means I'm right."" Your reaction to what the president told Time Magazine? HIMES: Well, Wolf, look at that. There's a reporter by a major -- a major U.S. magazine in the room, and breaking news, there's information out that in some bizarre way exonerates me. You know, look, I mean, this is just -- this was just straight from a vaudeville script to try to, you know, take the attention off matters that are very, very serious, like today's failure of their ability to do what they have been promising for seven years, which is to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and of course, the profoundly serious piece of information we learned on Monday with respect to the FBI investigation. But I mean, look, you know, the worst vaudeville script writer would have done better than what you just recounted to me. BLITZER: So, just one final question. Getting back to Adam Schiff's recommendation, maybe it's time for a grand jury. In Comey's statement, the FBI Director James Comey's statement on Monday, he said, ""As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed."" Based on what you know, Congressman, do you believe crimes were committed and that you agree, do you agree with Congressman Schiff that it may be time for a grand jury right now? HIMES: Well, let me clarify what Congressman Schiff said. He was not saying that this is the moment for a grand jury. He was characterizing the evidence he had and I would probably say something very similar. We're being very careful on my side of the aisle, and certainly Adam Schiff is being very careful not to draw conclusions this early in the investigation. Look, this is -- we are very early in this investigation. So, what Congressman Schiff was saying, not what wasn't that we should convene a grand jury.

I just want to ask you, also, because we're going to get you to play in a little bit, but you don't particularly like social media, but, under lockdown, you have started to, I think, engage with the public on social media, on Instagram, I think. And you're giving guitar tutorials. How did that come about? MARLING: That was -- that was a sort of reaction to the intensity of the lockdown, the announcement of lockdown, not that the intensity has shifted particularly. But I suddenly realized I don't really have anything to offer. I'm not one to -- I'm not a natural entertainer, so I wasn't going to do sort of home concerts. So guitar lessons seemed like a nice sort of boundaried interaction. And it's been very, very nice, I have to say. AMANPOUR: I'm giggling because you say you're not an entertainer, but you are.

What are you -- why are you doing this? MARLING: Well, it's a mix of all of those things. I think what drew me to psychoanalysis in the first place, other than being having been a patient of it, was the -- you know, the language with which to describe the persona -- a persona and a private experience of yourself, the interior, beyond the epidermal level, of what you are, and then what you present to the world is the meeting point of all kinds of difficulties and joys, and, you know, understanding the true motivations under things. And how -- just listening to the person who was speaking before me about Trump voters identifying as Trump voters, and how those kind of identities become entrenched and the motivations behind them become interdependently complex, and that's all psychoanalysis to me.

The organizers were thousands of miles away, in St. Petersburg -- CHANCE (voice-over): -- Russia, working for a secretive organization which, according to a recent U.S. indictment, had a strategic goal: to sow discord in the U.S. political system. Its name, the Internet Research Agency, dubbed the Kremlin troll factory by former employees who smuggled out these rare cell phone images. In 2016, CNN spoke to a Russian journalist who went undercover as an Internet troll there. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): The U.S. elections are the key issue for the Kremlin. And of course, Russia has invested a lot of effort into them. That's why the troll factories are working, I have no doubt. CHANCE (voice-over): It was during the Russian-backed rebellion in Ukraine in 2014, that evidence first emerged of pro-Kremlin troll factories, filled with bloggers paid to spread false information online about the conflict. And this is the Russian oligarch, who, according to the U.S. indictment, bankrolled the troll factory operation. Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as Putin's chef, because one of his companies provides catering services to the Kremlin, has denied any guilt.

The recent incident of stealing the e-mails of scientists at the University of East Anglia chose that some would go to the extent of carrying out illegal acts, perhaps in an attempt to discredit the IPCC. But the panel has a record of transparent and objective assessment stretching over 21 years, performed by tens of thousands of dedicated scientists. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLACK: If not for the Climategate scandal, it is very unlikely that Dr. Pachauri would have felt the need to come out in this forum of all places and defend the whole concept of climate science. This center behind me is filled with true believers on climate change. And certainly the scientists who are here, they believed the whole climate gate situation is a distraction from what they're really trying to achieve.

And what we found that there was surprising support for these ideas in unlikely places like China, like Egypt. Of course, the main drivers of anti-Americanism we found -- not of course but one thing we found was that opposition to President Trump largely hurt our image abroad, at least in these eight countries, as did American intervention is, and that was we ran a regression and that was the number two variable that contributed to anti-Americanism. And the third is the gap between the rich and the poor. So, perceptions of economic inequality in this country really hurt America's image abroad. On the positive side, on the pro side of the ledger, direct connections to a country's diaspora here in the United States contributes heavily to pro- American sentiment. So, that has implications for policymakers when it comes to immigration, specifically, as well as our cultural exports, soft power, consumption of movies, American news, American music, contributes significantly to positive ideas about the U.S. So, this democracy promotion that we've done with irresistible economic incentives and irrepressible military threats has largely failed to establish or foment really stable and long-lasting democracies around the world.

HIPPEL: Well, can I just say one point just to reinforce this last point on ""The Art of the Deal,"" I think that people around the world would be more supportive of U.S. foreign policy under Trump if they thought it was going to be win-win. But in fact, it isn't going to be win-win under Trump. It's about Trump -- he keeps saying America first. He doesn't say, you know, what's good for both of us and I think people can see that. On Iran, what I'm mostly worried about right now is that both Iran and the United States are nervous that one side or the other will do something, maybe it could be a mistake. And so, they're both preparing for, you know, defensive operations in a sense but they may misinterpret that as offensive and that's really my biggest concern right now.

What we've got to do, it seems to me, is get the consumer of last resort, the American consumer back spending again. And I think program like that, which I think could put -- I don't know personally, but I think the Bush administration is headed that way. You have to hit it with a two by four. HOPKINS: We've never had this combination of things, is that right? BRADY: I think that's right. There isn't anybody -- there aren't any resident scholars on how you behave when you're coming down out of a speculative bubble. And so put all the forces together: monetary, governmental. Cut taxes. And I think that's way to do it. HOPKINS: So the Federal Reserve has been very aggressive cutting rates, but you think they should really go to zero. We're at 2.5 percent. BRADY: I do, Jan. I think that the bottom of the last recession in '90, if my memory serves, we had negative real interest rates of one percent. We still have some to go. Let's keep going. HOPKINS: If it turns out that they overdo it, then we can take all of this back? BRADY: I don't think overdoing it is the problem now. I think you have got to get the consumer of last resort spending again. Get his confidence back. And I think an all points bulletin will do it. HOPKINS: What about, as we were talking about, airlines are starting to cut fares. Hotels are saying that people are starting to come back and fill rooms and travel. Do you see signs that things are starting to turn? BRADY: I'm not a good judge of that. If you keep pushing on all fronts that's the thing to do. This is coming out of a speculative bubble. Nobody knows exactly how to do it. Press the accelerator down. I'm not scared a bit of spending some government money at this point in time. HOPKINS: Are you heartened by the fact that this seems to be a bipartisan effort? BRADY: I think so. I can't see why there wouldn't be. Because I think it's a national problem. And I think the president has rallied everybody around. I think it is a bipartisan effort. HOPKINS: It's interesting. Robert Rubin, former Treasury Secretary, has been involved in meetings. Paul O'Neill, the current Treasury Secretary, has not been in those meetings with Congress. Where is he in all this? BRADY: I saw that stuff in the press today. I don't know why anybody is starting that. He's hard at work. He's not a guy that goes around trying to get his name in the newspaper. He's working hard with the president and the economic advisers. The fact that he's not up on the Hill blowing his own horn doesn't mean anything. He's doing fine. HOPKINS: And it's OK to bring in a former Treasury Secretary to get more ideas? BRADY: Sure.

744691,1009834,CNN,American Morning,"AHIP: Imposing new taxes and fees on health care services and on insurance flies in the face of the goal of reducing health care costs. ACOSTA: A spokesman for Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus called the report a health insurance company hatchet job. Plain and simple. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Karen represents America's Health Insurance Plans. ACOSTA: The report came as a surprise to the White House which had invited the industry to help crack health care reform earlier this year. LINDA DOUGLASS, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF HEALTH REFORM: What they did here was exclude all of the features of the Senate Finance Committee bill that lower costs for all Americans. ACOSTA: So, what are the facts? Last month, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said quantifying the bill's effects on premiums would be difficult. The CBO added overall premiums would be higher because future policies would cover pre-existing conditions. The budget office also pointed a finger at the industry noting that 23 percent of some premiums go to administrative costs. RICHARD KIRSCH, HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICA NOW: If the idea that the insurance industry would complain about high premiums is like the Yankees complaining that they're hitting too many home runs. It's totally preposterous. ACOSTA: You think they're showing their cards? KIRSCH: They're showing their cards. ACOSTA: Not surprisingly the insurance industry's report also takes a swipe at the public option, the idea of giving the uninsured the choice of a government health care plan. It's something now backed by the nonprofit group behind Consumer Reports. JAMES GUEST, CONSUMERS UNION: We're very strongly in support of the public insurance option as an option because we think that you can't get health care costs down unless there really is true competition in the health insurance marketplace. (END VIDEOTAPE) ACOSTA: The insurance companies argue the Baucus bill also weakens the requirements that Americans get insurance hurting the nation's ability to lower costs overall, but critics of the insurance companies say the industry's report is one more shot in the arm for the public option -- Kiran. CHETRY: All right, you know, and there still is a long way to go but it's very interesting how far this debate has gotten now. Jim Acosta for us this morning. Thanks. So we want to take a look at what's next if the Senate Finance Committee bill is passed today. Here's an ""AM Extra"" for you. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would then immediately begin closed door talks in an attempt to merge the bill with one that's already been approved by the Senate Health Committee. That one, by the way, includes a public health insurance option. Once a compromise bill is hammered out, it then gets sent to the Congressional Budget Office and there it would be analyzed for its cost and its impact on the budget deficit. Then it would eventually go to the Senate floor for debate possibly by the end of this month. ROBERTS: And then, of course,",0.051014809304485,2009-10-13

And they cry and they, you know, it`s a very, it`s a serious issue that`s important to them. HAMMER: And the added component is the teachings of the Jehovah`s Witnesses, which basically say for family members, they have to limit their association with gay family members.

Well, I mean, once -- it was fine once, you know -- it`s like don`t ask, don`t tell was fine. But once it`s made public, once the shows are airing, then it`s something that they have to figure out how they are going to handle. HAMMER: I have heard before where it`s not an uncommon thing for twins to be gay, but when did you come out to each other? JACOB MILLER: Right after we moved away from Montana and got to Nashville and I started working at an airline and I met somebody, of course, at the airline who was gay. And he became a god friend of mine. And the long story short of it is that I ended up -- he ended up being my first, my first gay relationship. And Joshua was...

HAMMER: And it came -- it enabled you to sort of come to terms with whatever you were going through in your own mind? JACOB MILLER: Yes.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: George Bush and John Kerry racking up a lot of frequent flier miles to the nation's showdown states. With me now to talk about three of shows are reporters from Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Tom Fiedler is with ""The Miami Herald,"" Dick Polman with ""The Philadelphia Inquirer,"" and Alan Johnson is with ""The Columbus Dispatch."" Tom Fiedler, let me begin with you. Hurricane Frances on the heels of another hurricane -- is this going to be a factor in the way people vote November 2nd? TOM FIEDLER, ""MIAMI HERALD"": Well, it's hard to know if it'll be a factor November 2nd. I think, in the short term, it's a factor in a couple of ways, although I wouldn't want to suggest that President Bush is coming here for political reasons. It's certainly useful that he comes to this state in the wake of a disaster and exercises the symbols and the power of leadership that he can do. That's certainly got to help him in the eyes of people. He's doing his job. And in the other side of it, as far as the people who have been victimized by this hurricane are concerned, the campaign for them is off their radar screens. And so, to the extent that that means that the John Kerry campaign sort of operates in the dark. That's got to be a factor, too. Whether that's a factor two months from now or not, it's pretty hard to project. WOODRUFF: Alan Johnson with the ""Columbus Dispatch,"" let's talk about Ohio. We were just discussing the latest in-state battleground poll with my colleague Paula Zahn. Those numbers showing President Bush doing better among likely voters just in the last few days. Does that square with your reporting? ALAN JOHNSON, ""COLUMBUS DISPATCH"": Well, I was going to say, with all due respect to your poll, I think it's a little bit tighter than that. I do think the president has picked up several points in the convention bounce, and the Swift Boat ads definitely made a difference in Ohio. But our last poll a couple of weeks ago had them 46-46. I think it's more than that now. The president's ahead, but I don't think it's anywhere close to double digits. It's very tight, very polarized state right now. WOODRUFF: Even with the bump the president got at the convention? JOHNSON: Even with that bump, I still think that we're probably more in the five percent, six percent range. I saw one poll today, 11 percent, and I just don't buy that. I've been out around the state, as have my colleagues at the ""Dispatch,"" and it's just much tighter than that in all areas of the state to say it's a double-digit or close to that, in my opinion.

PETER MARTIN, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER: Women metabolize alcohol somewhat differently from men. So if you have a drink of alcohol, there are higher concentrations of alcohol in the bloodstream reaching the brain in women because of these differences. FORTIN: As you get older, alcohol may become a crutch. New studies have found some people as they approach retirement may become depressed and turn to alcohol. MARTIN: There are lots of stresses with aging. And so, it's a combination of filling up one's time with drinking or using alcohol as a way to control your emotions and your feelings, to soothe yourself. That alcohol tends to be, for some people, a late onset phenomenon. FORTIN: And the effects of too much drinking over the years now begin to show up in your 50s. Like ulcers, liver disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. MARTIN: Chronic effects of alcohol on things like memory and attention and ability to focus and those kinds of things, they usually are the very first aspect that goes awry when people use too much alcohol. FORTIN: And as you age, watch what prescriptions you're taking. Medications for heart disease, allergies and anxiety should never be mixed with alcohol. Plus, you need to know what you can handle. MARTIN: As you get older, your brain does get more sensitive to alcohol. So if you were 30 and 40 and could drink two or three drinks at a party, you might only be able to drink one or two.

And right now, from Hollywood, Jessica Weiner, who is a self- esteem expert and founder of the Actionist Network. OK, ladies, I hold in my hand the Sandra Bullock-Jesse James divorce decree that SHOWBIZ TONIGHT obtained today. And I`ve got to say the speed, the civility of this divorce - incredible. No alimony, no spousal support. But, Jill, why do some people find it hard to believe that Sandra and Jesse could work this thing out so quickly? JILL ZARIN, CAST MEMBER, ""REAL HOUSEWIVES OF NEW YORK CITY"": Because when they hear about Michael and Diandra Douglas and what`s going on now 10, 20 years after their divorce, that`s why. Because they`re so used to people in Hollywood having these tortured divorces fighting over every nickel and dime. And here, both of parties walked away scot-free. There is nothing to fight over. ANDERSON: Well, in the advanced issue of ""People"" magazine that SHOWBIZ TONIGHT obtained today, the story reveals that is Sandra`s speedy divorce actually clears the way for her to adopt Baby Louis as a single mom. So here`s what I`m thinking, Jessica. Do you get the sense that Jesse and Sandra wanted to make this super easy, super speedy specifically for the sake of Baby Louis? Or do you think there`s something else going on here? JESSICA WEINER, FOUNDER, ACTIONIST NETWORK: I think it actually is for the sake of the new Baby Louis and also the kids that are in play. (CROSS TALK) And I think that that`s something - as Jill was saying, it might be shocking from Hollywood`s point of view. But if this is true and if our speculation is right, then thank goodness that they`re considering somebody other than themselves in divorce. Because as we know, kids` self-esteem plummets dramatically after their parents and co-parents get divorced. So this is a really beautiful step for them to forge the future for their family. ANDERSON: After Jesse was so selfish in what he did, this is maybe least selfish thing that he can do. WEINER: I think we have to separate that. I think within their personal relationship, his cheating was abysmal. And I think every woman in America would agree. But any mom in America would know it`s not always as black and white as looking at the relationship from the outside. ANDERSON: That`s true. That`s true and they`re being very mature about it. It seems well. A lot of people have been saying today this peaceful divorce could possibly pave the way for a reconciliation between Sandra and Jesse. But late today, we got the results to the brand-new SHOWBIZ TONIGHT exclusive poll where we asked - ""Sandra Bullock Divorce Finalized: Does Jesse James have any chance of winning her back?"" Only eight percent said yes. Ninety-two percent said not a chance. ZARIN: It`s better than the last poll. ANDERSON: You know, Jesse - well, that`s true.

You don't think there's an objective standard of better healthcare, if you get more coverage, you're paying less for deductibles, if you can keep your -- it covers preexisting conditions. CAIN: It's not cheaper. And you're defining better by forcing people to buy things they don't necessarily want or need. There are parents in their 50s who have no children, they are now paying for pediatric eye exams, things like this. Is that your definition of better? Things I don't need? HILL: Paying for pediatric eye exam is, first of all it's an outlier, but second they're still getting more coverages and more consumer protections in addition to pediatric eye exams, which they probably don't need. I can see. CUOMO: And an important piece for this going forward, one of the things you do well, Will, and hopefully a reflection of the best of the right is, what's the alternative? There have to start being alternatives on the table. I think you pushed the idea of this is bad, this law, as far as you're going to go with the shutdown. After that, you have to have an alternative. Forty-something votes to kill the law. It didn't work. Make it better. We haven't heard that part from the side yet. CAIN: I don't know that you're going to hear that, Chris, and here's why. The American people made their choice. When people make their argument that elections have consequences, they're correct. This is in the Democrats' hands now. Obamacare in its next year, the next several months is in the Democrats' hands. If it fails, as I suspect it might, then you're right, Republicans need to be ready. Here's what we would have like to have seen. Here are some free market solutions, some consumer cost pressures. We'd like to actually implement to bring healthcare costs down. Right now, Chris, there's not an opportunity for that. HILL: (INAUDIBLE) That horse is out of the barn. CAIN: That might be true. HILL: There's no way we're dialing this back (ph). I don't think it would fail. I thought it would be productive if Republicans came with ideas before it so-called fails. CUOMO: Your guys' discussion is always better than what we hear in D.C. I'm hoping that it kind of like rubs off, it's one of the reasons that I love that you guys come on.

D'ANTONIO: I think you touched on something very true, that Hope Hicks is sort of the closest thing to Ivanka Trump. And if you want to get in trouble with President Trump, you insult his daughter or, in this case, you summon Hope Hicks to testify before a committee. But I also think beneath that affection he might hold for her, there's a fear. So what does Hope Hicks know and what is she willing to say? Her decision to leave the White House when she did, two weeks after she learned the truth about how she had been manipulated by other officials and the president himself, indicates that she has a level of integrity similar to Don McGahn's integrity. McGahn, as we know, refused to do the troublesome things the president wanted him to do because they approached criminality. So he's angry on many levels here. And he enjoys venting that anger. It's -- I thought of a father who thinks he's going to scare their family by shouting. And it does work, but only for a moment. And it mostly works with people who are immature and easily scared.

I mean, Michael Smerconish, we know that she's been very cautious. She hasn't, of course, jumped on impeachment. What she said about being engaged in a cover-up is the strongest she's ever said. I know you're not subscribing to all this impeachment hype. But where does she go from here? SMERCONISH: Can I make a slightly different point? BALDWIN: Hit me. SMERCONISH: My truck is out of alignment. My truck is out of alignment and the roads suck. And so what the real takeaway is here is that infrastructure isn't getting done, and the country is crumbling. (LAUGHTER) BALDWIN: So what do we do about it?

KING: Could, Fran, from a security standpoint, shake the game too much in the sense that across the Arab world, the Palestinian crisis, the Palestinian's grievances, are often the source of tension, sometimes a source of violence at a time when you have so much uncertainty in the Arab Spring unfolding. If the United States had to use its veto in the Security Council to say no to the Palestinians, would you be concerned about what might happen in the Arab street? FRAN TOWNSEND, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR: Well, of course, I think there's likely to be a reaction in the Arab street, but you have to understand, the administration is a very difficult position with all the chaos throughout the region right now. There are real concerns about Israeli security. Israel is the only democracy in the region. And you've got sort of -- look at what's going on in Egypt with the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood. There have been protests in Jordan. I mean, this is a real-time of uncertainty, and the added tension right now really puts the administration in a very difficult position. KING: And so, Professor Telhami, this afternoon the Israeli prime minister says, no, don't do this. Don't do this. Let's have direct negotiations. And the Israeli P.M. on Twitter, ""I call upon Palestinian president to meet with me in New York to resume immediately direct negotiations for peace."" Might that -- is that enough, or would the Palestinians think it's a gimmick? TELHAMI: Well, look, there's been negotiations ongoing for decades, and direct negotiations for a couple of decades. Obviously, they haven't resolved it. This administration put a lot into it at the beginning and said this is a priority issue for the president. He expected to have some agreement by now. Nothing has happened. In the meanwhile, what do you have on the ground? You've got occupation 44 years. The policies (INAUDIBLE) -- policies have been born under occupation. Israelis have not had security. So, the reality of it is, there's something that needs to be done at the international level. The U.N. is a good place, but it should be an American resolution. It should be an American-led resolution that would put some outliers. It's not a substitute for negotiations, but there has to be some perimeters out there to regain the confidence. People are losing faith in the two-state solution as it is. You need to generate some international legitimacy for this solution, and I think the way to do it instead of going on the defensive and having a lose-lose is to come with the Europeans to put some reasonable proposition before the Security Council that would reinforce a two- state solution and then restart the negotiation.

It doesn't matter if you're a Mormon, it doesn't matter if you're an Evangelical, it doesn't matter if you're Catholic. That was a systematic theme throughout the three days of the convention. You see the -- you know, we heard gospel music, we heard mothers talk about how they had to lean on their faith to get through losing their children. That's really appealing and it was completely absent from the republican convention and that was a big change. ROMANS: Interesting. Also, I was -- I noted last night there was a sort of shout out from the president to Bernie Sanders supporters. BERMAN: Sure.

And when I was on the floor, and I mention this earlier, one of the things that really struck me is we heard even some of that booing happening during Michelle Obama's speech. Of course, they wish us. But in this speech they have the anti-TPP signs. Five minutes into Barack Obama speech, there was a man sitting in front of me, he had this Bernie Sanders hat. The hat was off. The sign was folded up and back -- I don't know where he put it, maybe he's waiting to lift it up tomorrow. But it was gone.

They believe this is a popular president. Maybe he can have some influence on British voters as they look ahead to this June 23rd referendum. This talk of the special relationship having no closer or stronger ally for the U.S. than the U.K. And the U.S. believing that the U.K. is strongest as a part of Europe, as a part of the E.U., that is something we know the president was encouraging. Of course, folks in the leave campaign, as you mentioned, believe that the president is meddling in U.K. affairs in a way that the U.S. would never accept. The U.S. would never accept other countries or other countries' leaders meddling in U.S. affairs. So that was the big news of yesterday. Today, of course, the president is in the middle of a town hall. He",0.2658264033264033,2016-04-23

And that's where I think you're going to see a more interesting and complex interaction with decoupling, right? Because even before this virus, the U.S. and China and potentially Europe were sort of moving into their own poles potentially with different supply chains. I think you're going to see U.S. companies looking very carefully at their supply chains in China, how quickly can they move things, what can be moved. We're really going to see the rubber hitting the road in that debate. ZAKARIA: And do you think, you know, as a result of all this overall growth, I mean, everyone is thinking -- FOROOHAR: Where is it going to be? ZAKARIA: -- about this because, you know, we're up in election season. FOROOHAR: Yes. ZAKARIA: Could you see growth slow down in the U.S.? FOROOHAR: I think there's two scenarios. One, if the virus continues for many more months and isn't stemmed, then yes, I think you are going to see certainly maybe half a percentage point being shaved off the U.S. If you start to get below 2 percent then you start to get into something if not a recession, that feels like a recession. What happens in November, if that's the case? Now there's a flip side which is that if the virus were contained very quickly you could actually see by November an uptick in demand because there's going to be a lot of pent-up demand, inventories, people will be restocking. So I think the jury is very much out on how this is going to affect the U.S. particularly in the election cycle. ZAKARIA: Fascinating, makes the election all the more of a cliffhanger. Thank you all very much. Fascinating conversation. We will have to come back to you. Next on GPS, you may have missed an important development in recent weeks. But the Trump administration extended its travel ban to six more countries. I will explain you to why it is particularly bad policy with respect to one country in particular, when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ZAKARIA: Now for our ""What in the World"" segment. Late last month President Trump expanded his travel ban to six more countries effective later this week. The new countries include Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and four African nations. One of those is the continent's largest economy and its most populous country, Nigeria. Officials justify the ban on the basis of national security concerns. As ""The Washington Post"" reported, they say that each country has gaps in its security protocols surrounding travel that expose the United States to terror threats. But that argument doesn't really make sense. As the Cato Institute found, no one born in Nigeria, Myanmar, Tanzania, or Eritrea, four of the countries, have been responsible for a single terrorist-related death on American soil between 1975 and 2017.

After all, he's a person who wants to increase the size and scope of the federal government, the largest we've seen since the -- since the '60s. He wants to increase the size and the scope of the federal government more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined. That's pretty big.

CALLER: And the paper that we have, the state paper today, the headlines were the Census Bureau, more mothers return to work. Sixty percent of women with young children re-entering the work force. And if you read down, it says the research shows that the majority would prefer if they had enough money to stay home with preschool children. This does not gel with this great prosperity that we're having, does it, Ed? ROLLINS: No, I -- listen, there's no question that the vast majority of families would be better off if one spouse could stay home and take care of their children. We have an economy that clearly that's not prevalent. And I think to a certain extent, if Mr. Bush's tax plan went through, he gets elected, more money will be in families and maybe there's possibilities of that occurring. KOCH: Can I comment on that? KING: Ed Koch, isn't it weird, Gore is not -- you have a surplus today of 237 billion, twice last year. Why isn't he way ahead? KOCH: For the reasons I've given you. KING: This is in the Federal Record. KING: But I want to comment on that tax that Ed Rollins just talked about. The Bush proposal is to give to 1 percent of the top taxpayers in this country, whose annual income is not -- never less than $319,000, to give to them 42.6 percent of the total tax reduction. They give to the country annually 33 percent of the total tax collected. If that isn't an outrageous give-away to the rich, to give them 1 percent of the people, more -- close to half of the total tax reduction, I don't know what is. ROLLINS: You're the first Democrat I've ever heard ever admit that the top 1 percent pay a third of the nation's taxes. What Mr. Bush's tax plan -- you ought to go read it -- is to reduce all of the rates and to give back to everybody who pays taxes a percentage by lowering their rates, a percentage of the taxes. KOCH: But why give them -- if they pay a third, why give them 42.6 percent of the tax reduction? That's absolutely correct. Don't dispute that. (CROSSTALK) KING: I've to interrupt.

That was a web camera, because this was initially, they said, oh, let's talk to the Tea Party folks out there via the Internet. So, she is looking at the Internet camera -- whereas, our cameras and other cameras were at a slightly different angle. So, that's why it was distracting on TV but not on the Internet.

Because he didn't have his cheerleaders over there to enthuse him and then he didn't have -- I mean, Americans were looking at that, it didn't look like there was much of a split in the room.

Most of the people choosing not to stay permanently, but a few of them are saying, I'm glad to be back, to sleep in my own bed, and hopefully things will at least start to get back to normal soon. But I think it's that, you know, because of all those explosives that investigators say were in that apartment, that a lot of people just aren't comfortable going there and staying there permanently. Yes, Fred? WHITFIELD: So, meaning, Don, some people still suspect that there may be some residual, you know, explosives still in the unit and it doesn't make them safe, or they just don't like kind of the eerie feeling, the knowledge that all of that was once in there? LEMON: I think it is a combination of that, and I also think, to add to that, the looky lous, so to speak, the people who are coming by, saying, oh, this is the apartment where, you know, the suspected shooter lived and who had threatened to blow up. And also the media. Yesterday, when they took down the police tape, the police kindly asked the media to leave at least the immediate property. And so, still in the periphery, you can see the media there. But mostly on the property, they are asking the media not to be there. So, the looky lous, they are not comfortable being there, and also probably with the media presence as well. It's a combination of things. WHITFIELD: Don Lemon, thanks so much, from Aurora, Colorado.

786434,1055499,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"make the most difference in telling stories about gun laws. Why Georgia is because according to ATF statistics, the guns that are recovered at crime scenes in other places outside of Georgia -- Georgia is the leader in the number of guns that are recovered. The latest statistics that we have date back to 2008, and it showed that since then, so almost 5,000 guns turned up at crime scenes that the were bought, guns that were bought in Georgia, turn up at crime scenes across the country. That's why we picked that. That's not the only state with the problem obviously, but it's kind of a good metaphor for what is going on. VELSHI: We just showed the graphic of the iron pipeline, and that's guns going from the South into the Northeast? LAVANDERA: Exactly. And that's one of the things especially in -- in Northeastern states where you have a lot of gun control advocates who are kind of frustrated by the sense that a lot of these guns that are bought in Georgia turn up at crime scenes up in the Northeast. So, there's that battle between the various states and how you set up these gun control laws. VELSHI: Hey, Ed, answer me this. If I am legally able to buy a gun and you're not, so let's say I'm a straw purchaser. I'm buying a gun legally, passing it on to you, maybe with some good assumption, if you're not legally able to buy a gun that something bad is going to happen. Am I not ultimately liable when the gun is traced back to me from a crime scene? I mean, is that worth whatever money you're paying me to buy a gun legally for you and give it to you illegally? LAVANDERA: Well, for you and i, that's an easy answer. But -- and that is the first question in -- that you have to fill out when you buy a handgun, or any kind of weapon, you fill out these -- these documents, for, you know, federal documents. The first question they ask you is whether or not the gun that you're buying is, indeed, for you. And that's, you know, gun dealers will tell you that, you know, that goes a long way. That enough should be a deterrent, because once -- if that gun does turn up somewhere else, it's easy for federal investigators to come back down and track you down, and that's -- you created big problems for yourself. Obviously, there are other people who say that simply isn't enough, and obviously they point to just the number of illegally trafficked guns that are on the streets today. VELSHI: Anything effectively being done to stop the straw purchases? LAVANDERA: You know, this is where it becomes kind of a delicate slope and why I thought kind of focusing on this would be interesting.

It's going to make things a lot harder, Pamela, and they're already facing just brutal challenges. BROWN: Yes, the unimaginable and they're facing those challenges without much help. They're really fending for themselves in the wake of this earthquake there and facing this storm coming their way. It's just awful. Matt Rivers, thank you. And back to our breaking story and the stunning collapse of Afghanistan to the Taliban. How did the U.S. not see this coming? My interview with former director of National Intelligence James Clapper, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BROWN: The Pentagon is sending 1,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan where the Taliban have toppled the government and seized control. It has been a day of breathtaking developments and heart wrenching images. The crowd you see in this social media post believed to be Americans and their allies at the Kabul airport waiting to board planes and leave the country. Now flights for allies have been curtailed so that Americans can get out first. Scenes of complete chaos as people clamor to be evacuated. America's longest war has ended in humiliating collapse. The Biden administration had assured Americans that there would not be such a breathtaking collapse so was it a failure of the intelligence community for the U.S. to be so unprepared? Earlier tonight, I put that question to James Clapper. He was director of National Intelligence in the Obama administration. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: Whether the Kabul collapsed immediately or in 30 days, the outcome was the same. And so we can argue about whether the number of days was predicted or not and that in itself is not just an intelligence call because clearly, you know, the State Department and particularly, the embassy itself I think would be the best source of gauging, you know, how long Kabul, how long it would take before Kabul fell. BROWN: But just to understand this as I pointed out on Friday, the State Department said it was not an imminent threat of falling. Now it has. The U.S. is pulling now embassy personnel in Kabul as the Taliban is literally taking over. How -- and just help us understand how that cannot be viewed as an intelligence threat. Do you think it's a failure of planning, logistics? What went wrong here? CLAPPER: Well, I think -- I would characterize it as a whole of government failure perhaps to see this because again I don't think this is exclusively an intelligence failure. Now the big message here, Pamela, to me is something, you know, we're relearning after my war on Southeast Asia, and that is we can't buy will to fight and the issue here, of course, was the effectiveness",0.2689814814814815,2021-08-15

The quake buckled roads, flattened homes, triggered landslides, too. One person was killed; 200 people injured. The quake triggered several aftershocks, as well, including one that happened this morning. There have been no injuries or any serious damage reported in the aftershocks. It's 15 minutes past the hour. Time for Chad who is watching extreme weather around the country, particularly in Texas and New Mexico today. (WEATHER REPORT) ROBERTS: As you're watching the severe weather we're here in Washington watching several developing stories today. The Pentagon's report on the death of Pat Tillman, the Senate vote on the war spending, and as always, the race for the White House. Elizabeth Edwards is campaigning for her husband in Ohio today. Her decision to campaign while fighting cancer takes the country into new political territory. John Dickerson is the chief political correspondent for ""Slate"" and he's with us. John, yesterday in that ""60 Minutes"" interview John Edwards said, look, we don't want the sympathy vote. Don't vote for me just because my wife has cancer. That would be a mistake. He also said that it is inappropriate for critics to call this, quote, ""a case of insatiable ambition over common sense."" I mean, understandable that he would say things like that, but by saying them doesn't he draw attention to both of those ideas? JOHN DICKERSON, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ""SLATE"": Sure. But I think what he has to do is confront this head on. And this is what they think is that this is, he can't shimmy away from these questions, he can't duck them. And people are out there talking about this. So, if he confronts them head on and says just watch me and he is up front about it, people won't think he is using this as a political sort of shield, to both benefit from it while trying to duck the hard parts of it and the hard questions about it. ROBERTS: I've heard some people say, you know, why is he doing this? He should be looking after his wife. But she's got stage four cancer. There is no big stroke treatment that is going to cure her. She can't have any kind of operation, and round of chemotherapy, so why not just live your life, while you've got it? DICKERSON: That's right. Well, in the interview, last night, they were very compelling. And she said, basically, if we don't continue, you choose to die. And what's extraordinary about this, that political campaigns can get frivolous pretty fast. And this one has gotten very serious, very fast.

399360,621192,CNN,Insight,"SHIHAB RATTANSI, CNN HOST: Explosions in India. A series of blasts hit at peak travel time, bringing Mumbai's daily commute to a shocking and violent halt. One of the main arteries of Mumbai punctured cruelly. Millions rely on the Western Railway every day, and at least 174 of them never made it home from Tuesday's commute. Hundreds more are wounded. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held emergency meetings and said terrorists were to blame for the attacks, and as authorities picked through the wreckage looking for clues, it's clear the attacks were planned for maximum impact. Tim Lister has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TIM LISTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was the evening rush hour in India's commercial capital. In the space of a few minutes a series of explosions tore apart crowded trains, all of them headed out of one of the city's main rail stations. Passengers leapt in terror from moving trains. Jagged holes were punched into carriages. Panic and chaos as fellow travelers and bystanders tried to rescue the injured. But many were beyond help. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Limbs laying everywhere, dead bodies cleared by the local business people who ran out of their shops to clear the dead bodies from the tracks and the platforms. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was the first class men's compartment, and the first class men's compartment was the place where the explosion was kept. LISTER: The dazed sat bloodied on platforms, anger mixed with shock. The number of dead climbed quickly into three figures, heavy rain hampering rescue efforts. Altogether, seven explosions on local trains in what police say was a well-coordinated attack. Another bomb was diffused. Mumbai has seen plenty of terrorism before, the worst previous attack coming in 1993 when at least 250 people were killed. In March of this year, 15 people were killed and 60 wounded in explosions at a Hindu pilgrimage in northern India. But the scale of these bombings dwarfs recent terrorist attacks in India. From the government, an appeal for calm. SHIVRAJ PATIL, INDIAN HOME MINISTER: The citizens of Mumbai have faced a similar trauma more than a decade ago. I am confident that the people of this great city have the will and courage to face this situation and will stand firm in their resolve to carry on their normal activities without succumbing to threats of terror. LISTER: And the question remains: who had the ability to carry out such an ambitious attack? Indian intelligence officials suspect a militant Islamic group based in Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Toiba. Although banned in Pakistan, the group is often blamed for attacks in India and just six weeks ago Indian officials complained to Pakistan that it needed to do more to crack down on militant groups. President Musharraf of Pakistan quickly condemned the Mumbai attacks, but the scale of these bombings is expected to complicate peace efforts between the two countries. Tim Lister, CNN, Atlanta.

Athena Jones is live at the White House with more. How are the numbers being taken? ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Chris. Some would say this is good news for the White House. These numbers show that the pace of enrollments has been steadily improving since those problems were fixed with the website healthcare.gov. And 700,000 people have signed up for health insurance on the state or federal exchanges so far in February. But still the administration would have to see record signups for the remaining several weeks of the enrollment period just to reach their new lower goal of 6 million enrollees by March 31st. That's 1 million fewer people than originally forecast before the messy rollout of the healthcare.gov website. Just last week, Vice President Biden said ""We may not get to seven. We may get to five or six million."" But he said that would still be a hell of a start. So we should expect to hear probably some language just like this from administration officials over the coming days trying to lower expectations. PEREIRA: All right, we'll keep watching. Let's take a look at what's in the papers this morning. First up, the ""Washington Post.""

Venture capitals in California, my home state, tell me that as soon as we move forward with some kind of bill that talks about energy independence and climate change that that would send a long-term signal that they would invest more than twice as much as they invested in high-tech and biotech combined.

What could the president do in terms of job creation in which Senator John Kyl, conservative Republican of Arizona, would say, ""Amen, Mr. President, I'm with you""? KYL: First of all, don't be pushing bills like cap and trade, which are big job killers. Don't be pushing a huge, expensive healthcare bill that will cause jobs to be lost, especially in the small business sector, because of all the taxes that are imposed in that sector. And third, don't allow taxes to go up. In fact, targeted tax relief for Americans would be the quickest way out of this recession. KING: It is not just Senator Kyl, Republican, who has questions and criticisms of your climate change bill. Jay Rockefeller, a more liberal Democrat from the state of West Virginia, a coal-producing state, says your legislation is a disappointing step in the wrong direction. He says the auto industry simply can't get there, the emissions. And he says the coal industry, the energy industry, simply can't get there. He says",0.1445785597381342,2009-10-04
239454,409843,CNN,CNN Live At Daybreak,"BREAK) COSTELLO: The waves are growing along the North Carolina coast. That is a sure indication that Hurricane Alex is closing in. But for many area residents, Alex, well, he really isn't that big a deal. Chad Myers is in North Carolina this morning. Ooh, the rain is coming down now. MYERS: Carol, I am going to need a bigger umbrella here pretty soon, because this is just the first of the outer bands. Obviously the eye wall is still offshore by about 80 miles or so, and that whole thing is going to be moving on here. And winds are now picking up to about 50, maybe 55 miles per hour, heading right through this umbrella. Anyway, the waves now, I would say, are a good eight feet, and headed higher. You can't see any more than about maybe 100, 150 yards out into the ocean now, because of the water coming down, because of the rain blowing sideways. As the eye wall moves onshore, you're actually going to see this even get worse than what we are seeing right now. The good news is we're in a very protected position. That's why we still have a satellite shot. If we didn't have this protected position, there would be no way we'd even get this signal out right now. Here's what we're looking at now, though. The radar picture itself has the eye itself -- and it's so easy to see. The place where there isn't rain, that's where the eye wall is. And as we see the orange and the yellows and even some of the reds heading up to Moorhead City, we are just south of that word ""Moorhead City"" in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. And this is what it's going to be like all day now. Squall after squall after squall, right up through Cape Hatteras, right through Kill Devil Hills, right on up even to (UNINTELLIGIBLE), and then eventually possibly some of this weather as far north as Virginia Beach and the Hampton Rhodes area. You don't have to really worry so much about the eye here. The winds are only 80 miles per hour, but there could also be water spouts coming onshore with this and obviously some coastal flooding. We're not going to see much in the way of a storm surge as it's going to be a glancing blow up the East Coast, not a direct hit. We are going to see -- are definitely going to see our winds and our waves come up here in the next half-hour or so. And I suspect as the high tides starts to come up, we're going to get this water an awful lot closer to our position. Back to you. COSTELLO: Chad, thank you.

It is scheduled to happen at 11:55 a.m. and you will be able to see it live right here on CNN. KAYE: But a reminder, the public ceremony is tomorrow -- the ceremony and the big speech and the parade and all that good stuff. BERMAN: So, we're going to talk about that right now. We're joined by two of our favorite CNN contributors, Maria Cardona and Ana Navarro. So, we'll start with Maria. We'll start with the Democrat here. They won. Privilege goes to you. ANA NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, you might as well. MARIA CARDONA, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you. BERMAN: What do you expect from the speech tomorrow? CARDONA: I think the president faces a couple of challenges. The first one is to emit optimism and hope, but also to be sober about what this country faces. It's not the same as it was four years ago. The excitement is not the same. But I think at the same time, Americans are looking to him to give him that optimism, to lead with that kind of optimism and sort of go down a path of how he's going to bring this country together. That's the other huge challenge. He faces a hugely divided country, a very partisan country. And so, he wants to be able to focus on what he can get done, make sure that the Democrats and all the progressives that supported him understand that he will stand by the principles that they supported him on. But he also wants to reach his hand out to the other side of the ideological divide and figure out how he's going to bring individuals to the cause, focusing on solutions for the country. KAYE: Let's talk about approval ratings, because, Ana, the president comes into his second term now with an approval rating of 55 percentage, which is actually 4 points ahead of George W. Bush back in 2007, but seven points behind Bill Clinton, who was up to 62 percent in 1997. So, with that kind of support, does he still need to reach out to the rest of the country? NAVARRO: He absolutely does. He has four years of governing ahead of him and he's got a legacy to build. So, these next four years are incredibly important for what Barack Obama, President Obama is going to stand for in history. I agree with Maria, it's got to be about unity. Tomorrow is a day for lofty rhetoric. It's not a day for details or policy specifics. It's a day to bring us together, to make us all feel Americans, to celebrate democracy. You know what I think he's going to try to be? Memorable. There's very few memorable state of the -- inaugural addresses. I think Obama, who's been one of the best orators we've seen in a presidency, is going to shoot for that memorable tomorrow. BERMAN: So, Ana, there are a lot",0.2078016952670258,2013-01-20

He is really risking putting his thumb so deeply into the eye of the nominee and of the leadership of his party he's going to have a hard time getting some phone calls returned for a while. SCHIEFFER: But you know, the interesting thing I think, Howie, is that again these campaigns and these conventions have become so predictable. You can never predict from John McCain... KURTZ: Let me break in for one second because John McCain and his wife Cindy are getting off the bus. We're seeing those pictures now. Go ahead, Bob. SCHIEFFER: I was just going to say because he is the one element that you can't predict. You don't know what's going to happen here. Reporters are just drawn to that. KALB: You've really got a coup d'etat taking place during this convention. (CROSSTALK) KALB: But one of the -- the point that Doyle made, and that was the question of the political revolt that was staged by John McCain. I mean, he introduced a torrent of suspense that we haven't had in this whole season. And that brought in listeners. And that brought in viewers. And the fact that you had a real narrative going because of the suspense. It isn't often that you see the designated hitter, Governor Bush, being challenged the way that John McCain did. CROWLEY: But Howie's right. It's over. That was three months ago, time to move on. But I think one of the things that it also brings to this convention is one of the remaining unresolved problems here is the relationship between McCain and Bush. KURTZ: Particularly after that strange dance on the vice presidency, ""Well, I guess I would accept if you tied me up and tortured me,"" and of course he did not get it. CROWLEY: Yeah, yeah. So that's a remaining story line that we're looking for is how do they -- is he up on the stage? What's McCain's speech like? Are they going to go campaign together, which by the way they are? So it gives us somebody to talk about it. McCain loves the limelight. We love somebody that will say almost anything. And so there we are. MCMANUS: And there is some practical political impact. McCain had tremendous appeal for independent swing voters in this country. The tone of his endorsement, he is going to re-endorse George W. Bush this week. KURTZ: But that's not why the press is all over him. MCMANUS: We're all over him because we're desperate for a story. KALB: Look at what we're doing right here, interrupting the program to take McCain live and talking about him. That is press seizure. There's no media fatigue with John McCain.

Also, why we're here, live in Jerusalem, we're following the grave condition of the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. A condition that threatens to send the Mid-East peace process into a tailspin.

I want to go to Jill Ryan, investigative reporter, because here`s one important fact that law enforcement is saying, that Ashton Sachs had purchased the gun that was allegedly used to kill his parents? RYAN: That is true. We have confirmed that he, in fact, purchased a gun. We`re not sure exactly when he did that or where he did that at this point, or what type of gun. That information has not yet been released. CASAREZ: To Dr. Joye Carter, who is joining us, chief forensic pathologist from Marion County, Indiana, who is joining us, actually, from San Diego, the heart of where this case is happening right now. Forensically speaking, the gun, because somehow or other, they initially thought it was business associates, but then they turned their attention, law enforcement, to the son of this couple. Forensically speaking, is that what could have led to these charges? DR. JOYE CARTER: Absolutely. They`re going to look at who purchased the gun, who had the gun. And if the son is the one who purchased the gun and used the gun, they`re going to look at that evidence, physical evidence, and try to track when that gun was purchased. That`s important. CASAREZ: Michael Christian, Nancy Grace producer, do we have any idea when and where this gun was purchased? CHRISTIAN: Obviously authorities have a theory about it, but they have not released that information, Nancy. We do know, however, they say they have the gun that they believe was used in this alleged crime. CASAREZ: Do we know, Michael, where they found the gun at all? CHRISTIAN: I`m sorry?

So the anger that Ashton must have had for his parents is absolutely unthinkable for most of us looking in, but there definitely is some sort of mental illness happening, and it was probably undiagnosed.

Who was going to lose and sit on their couch for the playoffs Tuesday? And who's going to get home- field advantage? Well, the Brock Osweiler-led Broncos, they're looking for the top overall season in AFC. Osweiler were struggling a bit against the Chargers. He threw two interceptions. Here's one that went through a receiver's hands. It would be five turnovers overall. You see he got it there on another one. Not really, just fall flat. Gary Kubiak puts Peyton Manning into the third quarter for a taint. And the fans would approve his first game since mid-November. Peyton looked pretty sharp. He threw nine passes and led the Broncos to the go-ahead drive. Broncos would win 27-20. Earning the top seed in AFC and now have a bona fide quarterback controversy in Denver. New York Jets facing their old coach Rex Ryan and my former team, the Bills. The Jets just need to win and they're in the playoffs. Dan Carpenter, the kicker, not happy after a missing an extra point. The helmet got the best of that encounters, guys. Now that's going to leave a mark. And Ryan Patrick will leave a mark -- Fitzpatrick will leave as well, he struggled against the Bills' D all day long through three interceptions all in the fourth quarters. Bills win 22-17. Spoiling the Jets' playoff hopes. Vikings and Packers ground up in the primetime game last night. Winners of the NFC North crowned in the first round home game in the playoffs. Packers down two minutes left. Aaron Rodgers picked off by Xavier Rhodes. They get another shot. One more time with time running out. Throws the hail Mary into the end zone but it's knocked down.

Saturday's wild card games start off Chiefs and Texans and the Steelers who made the playoffs due to that Jets loss, they'll play the Bengals.

KING: Right. RESTON: I, you know, I was just texting with folks like during the debate and some people thought that that was great, that he came off as a fighter, you know, the champion for the - for the working guy, whereas other woman that I've spoken to, you know, just didn't like that interruptions over and over and over again and clearly the Clinton campaign is trying to use that to their advantage today.

They're saying that Knight was just trying to flee the scene and couldn't see where the two men were standing. And if he didn't know they were there, he couldn't actually target them to kill them. Stephanie Elam, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE) PAUL: All right, you've seen the video. I know you've got some questions about this. But let me tell you something, HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson has something to say about it too and he's joining us in just a moment. Stay close. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAUL: So we've been talking about this $25 million bail that was set by the judge in Suge Knight's case and here he is collapsing in court when he hears that happening. Let's talk to HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson. So, Joey, here's the thing, and I'm wondering if we can please play the tape again as well of the incident in question. Suge Knight -- not this -- of the car and the surveillance video that was outside when he was -- when he ran over this person. $25 million, Joey. Do you think that is fair? Is that high for a case like this? What do you think? JOEY JACKSON, HLN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, good morning, Christi. Generally speaking, when a person is charged with a murder, you get what's called remanded. And remanded means, Christi, that there is no bail. So even the fact that there's $25 million, you can look at this and you can say, oh, it's excessive, it's violative (ph) of the Eighth Amendment, excessive fines. But at the same time, as a standard matter, there are some states certainly that would set bail and that bail you would expect to be very high when there's a murder involved, an attempted murder allegation, a leaving the scene when a person is injured and dead. And so remember the charges are serious. And also remember this. Whenever a judge sets bail, Christi, there's a number of criteria that they use. Like what? The nature of the offense, the seriousness of the offensive, the prior criminal history of the defendant. If any in this case we know that, you know, there's a significant criminal history. And as a result of that, the judge also looks at a possible flight risk -- excuse me. And, of course, here, the district attorney was speaking to the issue of potential intimidation of other witnesses. And so in light of that, the judge felt it was appropriate to say, listen, I'll give you bail, I'll give you bail, but it will be at $25 million. If you can't make",0.271297290846163,2015-03-21

The United States Supreme Court shut down the voting, overruled the Florida Supreme Court, and stopped the counting of votes. That is quite a difference from what you had in the Trump election, where 33, 34 cases, whatever it, was brought up. Republican judges dismissed it. BASH: Yes. And I don't mean -- and I don't mean to suggest... MCAULIFFE: There's no comparison. BASH: What happened in 2000 was so different. MCAULIFFE: Right. BASH: In 2020, Joe Biden won, full stop.

To give you a sense of these numbers, John, the total jobs lost in April, are more than double the total jobs lost during the Great Recession. This is what we're looking at here. And, yes, it was services because things like restaurant and bars make up two-thirds ultimately, of this economy. So it's not to be surprised or not surprised that that was what was hardest hit but its broad based too. There's good news and there's bad news here that the bad news is I think this underestimates the job destruction, the wages that have been cut, the hours that have been cut.

We could see an unemployment rate in the United States this week of up to 20 percent. We're still in a pandemic. We're bouncing back from depression era unemployment. I think the government needs to remember here that their job isn't done in terms of financial assistance of mid millions of people suffering, paying a price of this pandemic. KING: We get that report on Friday the latest -- CHATTERLEY: Yes. We do. KING: -- unemployment report. And I suspect we'll be having another depressing chat on them.

The automaker says it is working with unions and government health officials on the necessary safety measures to operate those plants safely.

HALPERN: Well, we basically said about applying across the whole range of areas. The most famous one was on both sides of the Atlantic, it has been pensions. As for literally decades governments have poured billions and billions in tax subsidies to encourage people to save. But Richard's work suggests there might be something else going on here. It is a bit of a hassle to opt into a system. So, from 2012, we flipped our system so it became an opt out instead of an opt in, in immediately you get no more than nine in 10 people saving. So, it's a huge impact on large numbers of people. QUEST: Cass, when these ideas come about, when these unique genius concepts formulate, what it is that like in that sense? I was watching the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" recently about John Nash, is there a eureka moment, where you say, ah, now I see and I can develop the theory further. SUNSTEIN: I think so. I think Thaler is the closest thing to a Charles Dickens of economics, in the sense that his eureka moments come from closely observing what people are actually like. and his basic guidance for the rest of us really is look closely. And sometimes if you look you will see something which will jar either the prevailing wisdom, or which will jar some theory that people in positions of authority using. And often I think in Thaler's work he has had about 12 eureka moments. When is a cashew nuts moment, another is that if people are automatically enrolled in something as David said, the participation rate is going to skyrocket compared to if they have opt in. And that is a very simple insight, it bears not only on savings policy but also in relief of poverty. And even on environmental problems. QUEST: Thank you so much, putting real life to us from the Nobel economics. Today the markets traded, it was up and then it was down, it was up and down, and with finally down. Not off the lows of the day, well off the lows of the day, but still down. But as my producer reminding me, Richard, do not get excited by the fact that it was down just 12 points. It's less than 1/10 of 1 percent. The Nasdaq also closed down and that marks the end of the nine-day winning streak for that index where it is constantly set record highs.

A short time from now, Democratic congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, of Hawaii is set to officially launch her presidential campaign. And CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us now. Arlette, this hasn't exactly been a smooth rollout for the congresswoman, has it? ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: No, Ana. Really, things have gotten off to a rocky start for Tulsi Gabbard. It was just a few weeks ago that she told our colleague that she was planning on running for president in 2020 and since then her campaign manager has already left before things have officially gotten started. She's also had to apologize to the LGBT community after a report came out that she had previously worked for an anti-gay group that had promoted conversation therapy. As well as working to pass legislature that was against same-sex marriage in Hawaii. Now, all of this controversy comes as she's really mounting a pretty longshot bid for the White House. She's one of the many progressives who is going to be running in 2020. She's a veteran of the Iraq war who really came into the spotlight back in 2016 as a vocal supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders, who she may find herself running against this time around and her team is really hoping that this campaign launch is going to be able to reset her campaign. Now, she's going to be taking the stage in a short while over in Hawaii, but she's already weighing in on one of the political controversies of this past 24 hours involving Virginia governor, Ralph Northam. She tweeted a short time ago saying we need to leave room for each other to evolve away from hatred and bigotry but saying that if Governor Northam, that if he cannot win back the trust of his constituents that he must resign. This is a little bit different from those other 2020 Democrats who are insisting that he has to step down. We'll see what happens with that in the coming days and we'll hear from Tulsi Gabbard in a short while. Ana. CABRERA: All right. We now you will report out when you get it.

But he -- I mean, he does have to admit guilt in this contract with the state, because he never actually has to admit guilt before a judge, but he does in this contract that he has to sign. COOPER: But -- but he is saying he's not guilty. I mean, he -- they -- they say they did not doctor-shop. SUSKAUER: Well... COOPER: So -- so, how is he going to admit guilt? SUSKAUER: Well -- well, but -- but he's -- what he did today was, he -- he self-surrendered, so, basically, he was arrested. And then what his lawyer did was, he just did some pro forma documents. He waived his formal arraignment, so he doesn't have to appear in court, and he entered a formal plea of not guilty. Now, that's just standard. Everybody enters a formal plea of not guilty at arraignment or to waive arraignment. Everybody did it. Scott Peterson did it. Everyone did it. But what he's going to do is, he's going to be admitting guilt when he is going to be doing this agreement with the state. So, that really is moot. So, he may be try trying to spin it, in that, listen, we're not guilty, but we're taking this plea because it's such a great deal. But he is admitting guilt here. He is admitting some responsibility in doing what he did, which is falsely -- falsely obtaining these medications, overlapping prescriptions. COOPER: There are those who will say, well, look, he -- he's getting singled out because he is famous. You know, there are also those who say he's getting special treatment. Is this normal, this kind of a deal, this kind of treatment? SUSKAUER: I don't think this is abnormal. I think this is a pretty much a -- you know, he would either get something like this, if it was just Joe Smith, or maybe probation with no conviction. But that's not what the state attorney's office offered in the beginning. They offered a more strict plea, probation, no conviction, for three years. And they have really fought this every step of the way. This case has gone all the way up to the Florida Supreme Court. And the state attorney's office has won every legal issue here. So, it just seems like, you know, sort of maybe the state attorney gave in a little bit, and Rush got such a great deal. And, I mean, this case really didn't get better with time. This case definitely was sort of a defendant's dream, in , when this case has gone on year after year, like this case has, witnesses sort of fade away. Their memories get a little fuzzy.

I'm Ryan Nobles in for Ana Cabrera tonight from New York. It is our breaking news right now, a terrifying race against time and nature. A mission to rescue a dozen young boys stranded deep underground in a cave, terrifying because the only way to save their lives may end up killing them. Rescuers in Northern Thailand gave up on their more careful plans to rescue the boys. It's now desperate. Their air is running out, and the space where they could -- they are stuck could soon flood with water. Emergency officials say it's time to get moving. CNN's Matt Rivers is near the entrance to the cave. And Matt, we've been hearing for hours that a rescue attempt could launch soon. Is there anything going on behind you that could support that idea? MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Ryan, look, officially, we had no confirmation that a rescue attempt has either started or is imminent. We were expecting one this weekend, but if you kind of take all the context clues and put them together, I mean, that green tarp went up yesterday. That was not there. We've been here for several days. Last night, when I was doing live shots right at this, I could have walk down that lodge out right there. At the same time last night, there was way more activity on the other side of that net. It is precipitously dropped. There's not a lot of rescue workers, authorities on the other side of that net right now, and when you couple that with the urgency of the situation, which we know entails oxygen levels dropping inside the cave and also the rains coming. This is July in Thailand. It's going to rain a lot. The forecast is calling for way more rain creating a much more urgent situation, authorities have said that. When you take all those context clues together, it certainly looks like something here is happening. But again, no official word yet, Ryan, from authorities that this very dangerous rescue mission, which would involve the kids swimming out of the case with divers assisting them using scuba equipment, no official word yet that it's begun. NOBLES: All right. So, Matt, what do we know, particularly about the boys and their well-being? Are there any communication between them and their parents? RIVERS: Yes, there has been. I mean, one of the priorities, Ryan, in the very beginning is to try and setup some sort of telephone communication between the parents and the boys inside the cave. That wasn't able to be accomplished. So, what they did in lieu of that was exchange letters. We got word around midmorning yesterday here local time that letters from the boys had made it out of the cave. Parents read that.

Does what the Constitution -- how they take the Constitution, not our bright, legal minds, but what they think is important -- is it okay to defend yourself in your home if you're under attack? In other words, the general theory is, do I have that right? I understand if you don't want to answer that because it might influence your position that you might have in a case and that's a fine answer with me, but those are the kind of things people would like for us to answer and would like to know. Not how you would rule or what you're going to rule and specifically what you think about it, but just yes or no. Do we have that right? SOTOMAYOR: I know it's difficult to deal with someone like a judge who's so -- sort of, whose thinking is so cornered by law. COBURN: I know... SOTOMAYOR: Could I... COBURN: Kind of like a doctor, I can't quit using doctor terms. SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. That's exactly right. But let me try to address what you're saying in the context that I can, okay? Which is what I have experience with, all right? Which is, New York criminal law, because I was a former prosecutor. And I'm talking in very broad terms, but under New York law, if you're being threatened with eminent death or very serious injury, you can use force to repel that. And that would be legal. The question that would come up and does come up before juries and judges is how eminent is the threat? If the threat was in this room -- I am going to come get you and you go home and get -- or I go home, I don't want to suggest I am, quite frankly. (LAUGHTER) SOTOMAYOR: Please -- I don't want anybody to misunderstand what I'm trying to say. If I go home, get a gun, come back and shoot you, that may not be legal under New York law because you would have alternative ways... COBURN: You'd have lots of explaining to do. (LAUGHTER) SOTOMAYOR: I'd be in a lot of trouble then. But I couldn't do that under a definition of self-defense. COBURN: Okay... SOTOMAYOR: So, that's what I was trying to explain in terms of why, in looking at this as a judge, I'm thinking about how that question comes up and how the answer can differ so radically given the hypothetical facts before you... COBURN: You know, the problem is, is we think -- we doctors think like doctors. Hard to get out of the doctors' skin. Judges think like judges. Lawyers think like lawyers.

QUESTION: What happened -- can you describe initially what exactly happened as the gunman arrived here at Ward Parkway Mall? SANDERS: What I can tell you is it's a Sunday afternoon in Kansas City, and one of our busiest malls, and, of course, it was crowded. You had a lot of people that were trying to get out once they saw a man with a long gun as they should have. They called the police department. We got numerous calls into the department on the man coming into the mall with a long gun. Officers went inside. Both Kansas City police officers and Leawood, Kansas police officers because it situated here on the state line, and went inside and basically stopped the gunman. QUESTION: Did the shootings occur inside and outside, or either/or? SANDERS: We found out after initially the gunman, once he got here, we'd discovered that he shot two people in the parking lot and killed them. They died from their injuries on the scene. We found that out after the fact. All we knew is once we got here at the mall that there's a man inside with a long gun walking through the mall. QUESTION: And tell me how he was shot dead. Two off-duty officers? SANDERS: I can't go into details right now about how it happened because right now we really don't know. Our standard procedure is to question those officers, and we allow our shooting team to come in and do their investigation so the officers don't have to repeat their story over and over and over again.

While Obama's campaign today promotes him as a different kind of politician, back then he was an avid student of Chicago-style politics. MENDELL: Morally, he had some complications with whether he should knock this woman out of the way. MALVEAUX: David Mendell is a Chicago reporter who wrote Obama's biography. MENDELL: In the end, what happened is we saw the first real example of Barack Obama's cutthroat nature when it came to advancing his own career in politics. OBAMA: I love him, but he's wrong. MALVEAUX: Obama's 1997 entree into the state Senate did not sit well with some legislators. MENDELL: They looked at him with some suspicion as to who is this sort of outsider in our ranks.

Some states are going to do what Texas does. And some state don't want that program. I think it's a good program. But some states don't want that program.

And look, the bottom line is last year was a one-time price increase. All the insurers esthetic, have said it was a one-time correction to make up for the fact that the they underpriced it for two years. They're on pace to have regular price increases, not zero, but 5 percent to 7 percent and the president's health payment has created uncertainty in the market, refused to pay cost sharing reductions, which cover out of pocket cost or loans of individuals. And as a result, premiums can go up a lot more this year. WHITFIELD: So Stephen, some Republicans have blasted the way their own party handled the repeal. Why is it that something that makes up nearly 18 percent of the economy, you know, was managed in this way without the kind of transparency that so many Americans have said they're deserving of? STEPHEN MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST: Well, certainly the process was pretty ugly process, you'll get no argument from me. The problem is that you know in terms of the fantasy that going to be some kind of a bipartisan solution. I mean here's the problem. I mean, there's not a single Democrat in the House and Senate that wants to repeal anything in Obamacare. They don't want to get rid of the tax increases. They don't want to get rid of the individual mandate. They don't want to get rid of the employer mandate. They don't want to change the way Medicaid works so that we can save cost by turning over to the states. So, what the Democrats want to do essentially, Fredricka, is enshrine Obamacare into the law so that we can never get rid of it. So, I just don't see any possibility, I wish there were, where Democrats say OK -- WHITFIELD: Even after hearing McCain, who made that impassioned plea that said there ought to be a bipartisan solution -- MOORE: Yes. WHITFIELD: Then hearing from Chuck Schumer, hearing from Charlie Dent, the list goes on where there does seem to be a consensus. That there can be some bipartisan -- a bipartisan effort to promote a fixing of the existing plan. You still feel even after hearing this in the course of the past 24, to 48 hours, that -- you don't think there will be a consensus? Now an impetus for bipartisanship? MOORE: Yes. How could there be? I mean, look, John McCain is a friend of mine. I would say senator point to me one Democrat who wants to get rid of anything in Obamacare? They want to actually expand it.

New details on the scandal surrounding former CIA Director General Petraeus, live from the Pentagon, up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MALVEAUX: New details surrounding the scandal involving former CIA director, General Petraeus. Barbara Starr from the Pentagon. What are we learning? BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: We are now hearing from two individuals who have knowledge of this, that General John Allen has adamantly denied he had any inappropriate relationship, any extramarital affair, with Jill Kelley. We have been told by a Pentagon official that General Allen directly denied this when asked to his bosses. We're told it's not Panetta -- he denied it, too -- but another senior official above him. And Nick Patton Walsh is getting a statement from someone close to General Allen and it says, quote, ""There is no affair. She's a bored, rich socialite involved with every single commander at CENTCOM because she's worked as an honorary ambassador."" This official close to General Allen goes on to say that General Allen has never been alone with her, that they have apparently all mingled at social events, and that General Allen goes everywhere with his wife. This said, it is still the case that General Allen is under investigation by the inspector general for what the Pentagon is calling inappropriately flirtation e-mails apparently with Julie Kelley, of course, the woman Paula Broadwell thought was moving in on David Petraeus. Broadwell sent e-mails to Kelley and that's what started all of this. Now General Allen now dragged in. So where are we? Inspector general is still investigating General Allen, whether he had inappropriate e-mails to Kelley. But General Allen's saying through intermediaries he did not have an affair with this woman -- Suzanne? MALVEAUX: This might be a basic question here. If there are flirtatious e-mails back and forth, is that grounds for dismissal or punishment? STARR: Yes. Right. MALVEAUX: What is that in the military role? STARR: Right. Right. What are we talking about here? If you call someone ""Sweetheart"" or ""Hon"" in an e-mail, can you lose your career over that? We asked that question around the Pentagon and you get non-specific answers. Basically, under military law, anything you do, as an officer, especially a senior officer, that brings discredit on the military, you can be held liable for. They -- I mean the blunt fact is, Suzanne, they can get you if they want to get you. That's the actual reality here. So depending on what these e-mails show, depending on what was said, depending on what the intent was, I think this will all come out. But you know what is interesting? Defense Secretary Panetta went right to the inspector general and sought a full investigation. No review, no analysis, none of those intermediary steps. MALVEAUX: Barbara Starr, thank you.

And yet, months later, they're singing a different tune. John Avlon gives us tonight's Reality Check. JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: That's right, Michael. So, Paul Gosar is at it again. No, not threatening AOC, or calling members, of the FBI and DOJ, traitors, or boycotting speeches by the Pope. No, this is a different sin, of blatant hypocrisy. You see? Gosar is doing a victory lap, for delivering federal cash, to his constituency, specifically COVID-19 relief funds that will be used to clean and provide relief, for the Kingman Arizona airport. In a press release, Gosar called it ""Critical funding, essential to maintaining safe and reliable air service to the community."" But what he failed to mention is that he voted against the legislation that made it possible, the American Rescue Plan Act. He slammed it, in fact, saying ""This bill is not about COVID relief. It's about funding Democrats' pet projects. The American people should be furious,"" and called it ""A Democratic Spending Bonanza."" Well, which isn't, Congressman? A socialist spending scheme, or critical funding, for the community? But, you see, Gosar understands that he can vote ""No,"" and still score the dough. And he's far from the only congressman, to take credit for a bill that he tried to kill. Take Alabama Congressman Gary Palmer, the Republican Freedom Caucus member, who voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Called it ""Recklessly expensive,"" and then promptly put out a press release, touting its benefits, back home, saying, ""Funding the Northern Beltline has consistently been one of my top priorities. It will benefit the entire region and enhance economic development and employment opportunities."" Now, these are only a few blatant grating examples. I could add in other sworn enemies of bipartisanship, like North Carolina's Madison Cawthorn, Indiana's Greg Pence, or their leader, California's Kevin McCarthy.

Thousands of the creators roam free, making daily life difficult for the capital's human population. Satinder Bindra reports.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): A monkey bounced on me and tried to scratch my face. I pushed it away. But in the scuffle, he bit my leg. BINDRA: Monkey bites spread bovine tuberculosis. And India's capital has been invaded by these pesky primates. (on camera): In some neighborhoods, so many people have been bitten that only the bold and brave venture out in the streets, armed with bats and sticks. No place appears to be safe. (voice-over): The Indian Defense Ministry, too, has been frequently invaded by bands of ravaging monkeys, who tear sensitive files and trash furniture. Officials are at wits end. Catching monkeys here is a big cultural no. In India, millions worship the popular monkey god Hanuman. It's considered auspicious by some to literally bombard the monkeys with food. In a country where millions are on the verge of starvation, these monkeys are so stuffed many spend their entire day sleeping. B.P. MISHRA, NEW DEHLI OFFICIAL: We are a very complicated society. One side, we would like to have a city that is something like Paris. On the other side, we would like to have all the animals in the city.

Enter monkey catcher Shyam and Raju the black-faced langur, or long-tailed monkey. Langurs are the larger cousins of the rhesus monkeys, who're so petrified of the langurs they flee within moments of spotting one. Chasing monkeys is hot, tiring work.

But, indeed, Israel fired back against several Syrian military positions on its side of the border, across the Golan Heights, because they say the Syrians fired on them.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WARREN: Who are the three wisest people you know in your life and who are you going to rely on heavily in your administration? OBAMA: There are so many people who are constantly helping to shape my views and my opinions. You mentioned one person I would be listening to and that is Michelle, my wife who is, not only wise, but she's honest. And one of the things you need, I think any leader needs, is somebody who can get up in your face and say, ""Boy, you really screwed that one up. You really blew that."" WARREN: She talks like that to you? OBAMA: Yes. That's very helpful. Another person in that category is my grandmother. She was an extraordinary woman. She never went to college. They worked on a bomber assembly line during World War II when my grandfather was away. Came back, got a job as a secretary and worked her way up to become a bank vice president before she retired. And she's just a very grounded, common sense, no fuss, no frills kind of person. And when I've got big decisions I often check in with her. In terms of the administration or how I would approach the presidency, I don't think I would restrict myself to three people. There are people like Sam Nunn, a Democrat or Dick Lugar, a Republican, who I'd listen to on foreign policy. On domestic policy, I have friends ranging from Ted Kennedy to Tom Coburn, who don't necessarily agree on a lot of things but who both, I think, have a sincere desire to see this country improve. WARREN: Yes. OBAMA: What I found is very helpful to me, is to have a table where a lot of different points of view are represented, and where I can sit and poke and prod and ask them questions. WARREN: Yes. OBAMA: So that I'm not -- any blind spots I have or predispositions I have that my assumptions are challenged. And I think that that's extraordinarily important. WARREN: Okay.

But as the rescue helicopter arrived and began taking fire as well, the sergeant knew time was critical to get his wounded teammate loaded and treated. So he once again knowingly and willingly stepped into the enemy's crosshairs. Sergeant Celiz used his body as a shield for the aircraft and his crew against the heavy incoming fire. The helicopter began to take off, and he put himself directly between the cockpit and the enemy, ensuring the aircraft could depart and sustaining what would prove to be a mortal wound. He knew he was hit, but he waited for the air crew to depart without him. In the face of extreme danger, he placed the safety of his team and his crew above his own. I can offer no better encapsulation than the words of U.S. Army ambulance pilot in command that day. He said -- quote -- ""Courage, to me, is putting your life on the line to save the life of another, as demonstrated by Sergeant 1st Class Chris Celiz, who died protecting my crew"" -- end of quote. Christopher Celiz was courage made flesh. Today, we add his name to the elite vanguard of American warriors who generation after generation have strengthened and inspired our nation with their unwavering bravery and service. His legacy lives in the lives he saved, the teammates he mentored, and the memories he made with his beloved wife, Katie, and especially -- and their precious daughter, Shannon. Thank you for sharing your dad with our country, Shannon. We will never forget the debt that we owe you and your whole family. August 28,2013, then-Staff Sergeant Earl Plumlee was snapping a quick photo with members of his unit at Forward Operation Base Ghazni in Afghanistan. Then, insurgents, it turned out, detonated a 400-pound car bomb that blew open a 60-foot-wide breach in a perimeter wall. Staff Sergeant Plumlee and members of his special operations team immediately hopped in a nearby truck and raced toward the blast to defend the base. When they arrived, they encountered insurgents coming through the wall, all wearing explosive vests. Our troops started taking rocket fire, recoilless rifle fire and small-arms fire. While the driver of their truck maneuvered into the line of enemy fire to shield injured members of their team outside the vehicle, the staff sergeant exited the vehicle and used his own body to shield the driver. He left whatever cover the truck provided him and began to engage the invaders. Outnumbered, with no regard for his own safety, at times armed with only a pistol, Staff Sergeant Plumlee attacked the insurgent forces, taking them on one by one. And time and again, bullets flew by, sometimes only inches away. And time and again, Staff Sergeant Plumlee closed with the enemy. On multiple occasions during the fight, the insurgents detonated their vest right in front of him, Plumlee, at one point hurling him into a wall and injuring his back.",0.0808856021418731,2021-12-16

It's bad economics especially. And people -- SPITZER: Can I stop you one second? PAUL: Well, let me answer. SPITZER: No, no, we'll take this sequentially. No constitutional authority -- just so we understand, we'll get to economics in a second. No constitutional authority to set up FEMA is what you're saying? PAUL: That is what I'm saying. Let me answer my question. No, there's no constitutional (ph) to set up an authority that you take money from one state and give it to somebody else because they've been injured. But let me make the important economic point is if you want -- if I want to build my house on the beach and I can't get insurance, why should I get subsidized insurance to build my house in dangerous area. When you can't get private insurance because it's so expensive, it's telling you something. Why should people build there and pass on the penalty to somebody else who don't get to live on the beach? See? That makes no sense whatsoever. This whole idea that we have this moral obligation -- what about the moral obligation to allow people to keep what they earn and assume responsibility for themselves? So, this is precisely a program that is very similar to so many others that has gotten us into this mess. SPITZER: Let me read to you something else that you said. You said, ""The government, they have nothing. Everything they get and they want to give to someone else, they have to steal it from somebody. That's called taxation."" Is taxation theft in your mind? PAUL: Yes, it is. You steal from a productive individual and give it to somebody else. So -- SPITZER: It is theft -- I just want to understand this. We've had lots of conversations in the past. I always enjoy them. But I just want folks to understand your notion that taxation that is there to pay for things such as national defense or environmental cleanups or FEMA, that is theft in your view? PAUL: When you take the income from other people, it is. The Founders didn't believe in it. It was not an income tax. That's a recent event. It's not even 100 years old. It hasn't served us well. All it has done is give us a government out of control -- a warmongering government that has an entitlement system that there is no way they're going to pay for it. So, it's all based on an immoral principle that government takes and they can't produce anything. They have to take it from somebody else and that's a moral issue. SPITZER: But, Congressman, wait a minute. We can agree -- taxation was embedded in the very foundation of the Constitution. PAUL: But not income tax.

Thankfully, the hospital`s maternity ward had a security system -- it`s very high-tech -- that stopped her dead in her tracks, literally trapping her inside the hospital. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The hospital had put an electronic bracelet on the right ankle of this infant. When the suspect tried to leave the hospital, it sounded an alarm and it automatically locks the doors and prevents her from leaving. She`s trying to open the door to get out, and that`s when she was confronted by staff. (END VIDEO CLIP) VELEZ-MITCHELL: This suspect has three children and is separated from her husband. Police say she told her husband months ago that she was pregnant with his baby. Apparently a lie. When the fake due date approached, she then felt compelled to get a baby somehow to continue this apparent charade. Even scarier, police think she was trolling for babies at another hospital last week. Attorney Tanya Acker, thank goodness there was a high-tech security system that did its job. I mean, I love how it literally shut the doors and locked them. But it`s terrifying that, in the 21st Century, somebody can just put on some scrubs and stroll into a room with a bunch of babies. ACKER: Absolutely. You know, you`ve got to really commend this hospital and their security procedures. Certainly, this is something that they have a duty to do. I mean, you know, look, nobody can absolutely protect against every nut job out there that wants to steal a baby, but a hospital certainly has a duty of care to its patients to ensure that they and their newborns are safe. And this hospital really did that. They really should be commended. But this case, Jane, obviously raises so many questions again as we were just talking about, about this woman`s mental health, about what would really compel somebody to go out and try to steal another person`s child, all just to try to maintain some facade of being pregnant in a bad marriage. VELEZ-MITCHELL: Well, she says she has no history of mental illness, but I have a feeling she must have deep psychological problems if this is true. A pregnant woman called the cops on this very same suspect just last week after apparently talking to her at a different Southern California hospital. Turns out the woman was right about Ramirez. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She was questioning expectant mothers about their birth status, what was the sex of the baby and when was the baby due? One of those expectant mothers became suspicious, contacted the police department. That expectant mother positively identified our suspect as the one that she had contact with last week.

Many schools were closed, but it's terrible for just about everyone else, especially travelers. The Denver International Airport had to shut down. United Airlines canceled more than 600 flights, causing a ripple effect of delays and headaches from coast to coast. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have a son graduating from Penn State on Friday. And we're going to miss it. There's no way to get there, it looks like. So, I know everybody is here for holiday travel, but we were just trying to get to a graduation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's very frustrating for travelers, particularly because this is a holiday period. I mean, this is probably one of the worst times when this can happen.

A manhunt is under way in Pontiac, Michigan. Four men escaped from police custody at the courthouse there. There are reports as many as three of the men were captured soon after.

ANDERSON: Nic, as one local commentator here in the Gulf put it today, this is a war by proxy of exceptionally rare nature even by the standards of the Middle East. This will inevitably be a long and unpredictable process. What chance do you think Geneva will achieve anything substantive in the short term at least? ROBERTSON: It's very hard to judge. I mean, if you look at the past two attempts, because this after all it's called Geneva III, the last one, Geneva II talks were two years ago and lasted about two weeks before they broke down. The UN blamed it on the Syrian government for only wanting to talk about terrorism and not wanting to talk about the substantive issues. We were there when the Syrian government head of delegation, he's the Syrian representative to the United Nations, Dr. Bashar al-Jaafari, was speaking -- again terrorism was a big issue for him. But I think, look, we can break it down this way. At the moment, you have both sides here. The talks haven't really started properly. The special representatives, special envoy, Staffan de Mistura who mediates the talks went in to meet informally with the opposition today, the High Negotiating Committee, the HNC. The HNC has been holding out to go into talks properly because they want humanitarian access, they want prisoner releases. They want an end to the bombardment. They say that is all enshrined in the UN resolution that brought about these two talks -- brought about the talks. OK, so where do things really stand? But I've talked to both the opposition and they asked the question of the government representative today about those issues, about the issues that the opposition is demanding first. This is how they answered.

I know that there was a conference in January 2001, which you attended, at which you felt that bin Laden was better described as a religious warrior, and should not actually be thought of as a terrorist. GUL: No. We said, unless the evidence is brought up against him, then he is not a terrorist. It's wrong. 9/11's full evidence has still not emerged. It is still shrouded in mystery. A lot of people have a lot of misgivings about that. And it's not only me. I think a lot of people in America would be thinking the same way. There are scientists, there are scholars, who have written articles on it. So, I think to dub a man as terrorist - because I know, I heard him twice say on radio, or something like that, and I think it was Osama - not only that, but Mullah Omar also said that he did not believe that Osama had carried out that act. So, that is still a mystery, and it needs to be resolved. Americans have still to set up a proper commission, an inquiry commission, into this event. I think that's very important. And I think President-designate Obama would do well to set up an inquiry commission into this. ZAKARIA: What is your hunch as to who did - who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks? GUL: Well, I have been on record, and I said it is the Zionists or (ph) the neocons. They have done it. It was an inside job. And they wanted to go on the world conquerors. They were looking upon it as an opportunity window, when the Muslim world was lying prostrate. Russia was nowhere in sight. China was still not an economic giant that is has turned out to be. And they thought that this was a good time to go and fill (ph) those strategic areas, which are still lying without any American presence. And, of course, to control the energy tap of the world. Presently, it is the Middle East, and in future it is going to be Central Asia. So, there are many, many XX. And, of course ... ZAKARIA: But you think ... GUL: ... XX.

AVLON: But I think overall, what the speech attempted to do is answer critics by showing not telling, right? By implicitly, look, the other motif of these speech, as a former speechwriter, is that he set up the story of her life, as someone her doing things for other people, rather than Donald Trump doing things for himself. CAMEROTA: And, further, and one of the interesting things, he turned the narrative. Everybody thinks, oh, well, he dragged her into public service. He dragged her into politics.

He asked me back to his room, his dressing room, again that night between his first and second show to play backgammon. He said, Let me make it up to you. Come back tonight. We`ll play some backgammon, and then I`ll get you that front row seat. I felt it was a sincere apology. I accepted his apology. And I did return the next night, in part to prove to him and myself that I didn`t ask for anything, I simply was accepting the invitation that was offered. I vowed before I went I wouldn`t drink anything offered there and I wouldn`t drink anything prior to, so that I completely had my wits about me, just to be completely clear of what was to take place and what wouldn`t. I did return the next night. We did play a few games of backgammon, again alone in his dressing room. And at one point, he indicated it was time for him to get ready now to go to the second show. Therefore, I felt someone would come soon to escort me to my seat for the show. And much to my surprise, he came at me again. He wrapped his arms around me in a tight bear hold where I couldn`t get away, and he was forcefully trying to kiss me again. I told him to stop, No, get away, and I pushed him away. And I left and I never returned, never called, never spoke to him.

And that`s what you remember. When you -- you said one of the last memories you had was him wearing the silver bracelet that had his wife`s name engraved on it, Camille. What was he doing at that moment when you recall seeing that bracelet? KIRKPATRICK: He was on top of me. GRACE: Were you lying down? KIRKPATRICK: Kissing me. Yes. Yes, I was, but...

SHUBERT: Despite several terror arrests happening very early this morning, the pope went ahead with his scheduled itinerary, including one of the highlights of his visit, a speech that was delivered here at Westminster Hall. Here's what he said. POPE BENEDICT XVI: God wants your friendship. And once you enter into a friendship with God, everything in your life begins to change. As you come to know him better, you'll find you want to reflect (ph) something of his infinite goodness in your own life. SHUBERT: As you can see, plenty of the pope's supporters are here today, and the crowds are expected to be even bigger tomorrow when he holds his mass, prayer vigil. And protesters against the pope will be taking to the streets of London. Security is tight today, and it will be even tighter tomorrow. Atika Shubert, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON: That's right. So I'm joined again tonight by CNN's senior Vatican analyst, John Allen. First your reaction to what we've seen and heard today, John. JOHN ALLEN, CNN SENIOR VATICAN ANALYST: Well, it's been an extraordinary day, I think, for the 83-year-old pontiff, a very busy day, highlighted, I think, by the events this evening, his visit to Lambeth Palace to meet the archbishop of Canterbury to try to overcome the differences both historic and of recent vintage between these two churches, and also by this remarkable speech that the pope gave tonight to really the cream of the crop of political life in Britain, including four former British prime ministers, in which the pope essentially argued that reason - - and by reason, he means sort of secular society -- that reason and faith need one another, that reason without faith becomes destructive ideology, faith without reason becomes sectarianism and fundamentalism. You know, I think it remains to be seen what the sort of eventual response to that speech will be, but certainly, talking to people -- and I was on the scene -- talking to people coming out of Westminster Hall, the general impression was that this was a remarkably thoughtful speech from a pope who is also, of course, a world-class intellectual. ANDERSON: Fascinating. All right, stay with me, John, because while the terror arrests threatened to overshadow day two of the papal visit, of course, it's still the clergy sex abuse scandal that is dogging the pontiff everywhere he goes. And it's not just here in the U.K., but around the world. Let's take a look at how the controversy is playing out in two very different countries, corners of the earth.

He believed information he was purveying and part was valuable. But his goal was to get the U.S. to invade Iraq. Sir, knowing what we now know and given the state of Iraq and neighboring Syria, have you changed your opinion? GALBRAITH: No. He was a patriotic Iraqi. He had no resources. He didn't have much political support in Iraq. He had no military and he got the United States, the most powerful country in the world, to loan him our army. I don't fault him for having done that. I fault the people who took everything he said as the gospel truth. But I can tell you if the United States had ever gotten a foreign country to spend $2 trillion to accomplish our objectives, we would say that was a great covert action or great success. But let's put the responsibility for this fiasco where it belongs, it is on the Americans who launched the war without planning and without considering what would happen afterwards. And a final point, though. I would argue that Iraq actually is better off. After all, 80 percent of the people of Iraq are either Kurds are Shiites. The Shiites were repressed for the entire history of Iraq. They now run the country. The Kurds always wanted independence and that's basically what they now have. ANDERSON: With respect, sir, to the hundreds of thousands who have lost their lives and the millions displaced, I'm not sure they agree Iraq is a better place. I put this to you, despite the fact you say you don't blame him, you blame those who took his advice, in the end did his efforts and those who supported the invasion that he had effectively -- he was the architect of - - contribute to the rise of is? GALBRAITH: Absolutely. There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and there was no al Qaeda. And these were the things that justified the war. But by going into Iraq, United States made Iraq the prime base for al Qaeda type or more radical Islamic terrorists than al Qaeda. And of course let's not forget about Iran. George Bush when he -- in justifying the war said he spoke of an alliance axis of evil between Iraq and Iran. But of course at that time they were bitter enemies. Today, Iran has no closer ally than Iraq. And that's, though, result again not of Chalabi but of gullible American officials who simply accepted what he said and really didn't care to do the due diligence about what might happen. We are living with the catastrophic consequences of the American decisions. ANDERSON: How close was he to the Iranians? GALBRAITH: Again, Ahmed was a skilled political leader.

BLITZER: Do you believe the Saudi explanation that there was a fist fight that got out of control and Khashoggi wound up being killed? REED: We'll have to see. There's no doubt that he was killed. He was with Saudi Arabian officials when that occurred. And so we've just got to wait for those final details. But being able to impose sanctions, not -- we have to keep this in mind, Wolf. Now that we are the world's largest exporter of oil, we don't have oil dependency issues that will restrain us from taking appropriate action here. And I'm so pleased that we're in this position as a country. BLITZER: Should the U.S. halt arm sales to Saudi Arabia right now, at least temporarily, until the investigations are all complete, as Germany, for example, has already done? REED: Well, you know, I respect Germany's decision, but we do need to get further evidence. Obviously having relationships with Saudi Arabia is something in our strategic interest, but sanctions do need to be imposed. And when we talk about arm sales, we've got to be very sensitive to the fact that if they don't buy arms from us, who are they going to buy them from? And that is something that has to be taken into consideration? BLITZER: Well, do you think there's a moral consideration underway other than just the nuts and bolts of arms sales and potential revenue coming into the United States? REED: Oh, absolutely. And that's why morally, and from diplomatic perspectives, there needs to be action by America. And I'm just so glad we're not restrained by the historic oil dependency relationship that we used to have. We now control our own destiny on our energy supplies. That also frees us to make additional sanctions put on the table that otherwise would not have been. BLITZER: I want to move on to another issue, but very quickly, do you believe that Khashoggi was murdered inside the Saudi consulate and that the crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, was fully aware of what was going on? REED: I believe the murder did occur within that area. Now, who knew what when, that is something we do have to wait for the evidence. But, you know, my understanding of the Saudi Arabian relationships, it's very unlikely that the appropriate people didn't know about this situation.

New York Police say they found nearly 50 envelopes containing what they believe to be heroin inside Hoffmann's Manhattan apartment. Labeled with the street name ""Ace of Spades."" Also in his apartment, more than 20 used syringes in a plastic cup. Several other bags containing white powder and prescription drugs. Police are trying to piece together the final moments of Hoffman's life. His Saturday beginning here at the local coffee shop. JONATHAN HANSON, MANAGER, CHOCOLATE BAR: He seemed in good spirits, he's very happy, I mean, typical chatting with the staff. TURNER: At 1:30 that afternoon, Hoffman's assistance spoke with him over the phone. Investigators say she said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. About a half an hour later investigators say Mimi O'Donnell, the actor's ex-partner and mother of his children, told them she saw Hoffmann near his apartment where he appeared to be, quote, ""high."" Earlier that evening Hoffmann then had dinner at this local restaurant with two of his friends. MIKE, PATRON, AUTOMATIC SLIMS: I heard he had relapsed recently. He was having trouble. So it wasn't a total shock, but it's a sad thing. So it wasn't a total shock, but it's a sad thing. TURNER: At 8:00 that night O'Donnell said she spoke with Hoffman over the phone, telling investigators once again he seemed, quote, ""high."" The next morning around 9:00 Hoffman was expected to pick up their three children but never showed. That's when O'Donnell called Hoffman's friend, playwright David Katz to check on him. At 11:00 a.m. Katz found Hoffman in the bathroom of his 4th floor apartment with a needle in his left arm, wearing a T-shirt, shorts and glasses still on his head. Minutes later he was pronounced dead.

They all know that they have to raise the debt ceiling because of the potential economic consequences that would come from the first ever U.S. default. Nobody wants to be blamed for that. But virtually nobody wants to actually cast a vote to raise the debt ceiling, which is why we've been in this situation, this staring contest for weeks. And now we're reaching to the point where they are going to -- they have come to this agreement -- the leadership has -- to extend the national debt ceiling by $480 billion, expected to take the country up until early December, at which point that definitely could be breached again, and then we'll be back in the same situation. Now, Richard, at this moment, it's still uncertain exactly how this vote is going to play out today. Republicans having a hard time because they now have to convince 10 of the Republicans to break ranks, vote with all 50 Democrats on this short debt ceiling increase after months of saying that Democrats alone were responsible for increasing the national debt ceiling. And we're learning and talking to senators and top Republicans that they do not have those 10 Republican votes yet. So these discussions are happening behind the scenes. There are still some expectation, because this was a deal cut by Republican Leader Mitch McConnell that they will get those 10 Republicans to break ranks, but at the moment, they don't have it, which just goes back to my initial point. They know they have to do it, but they don't want to own it. QUEST: So two things here. Firstly, surely if the leader -- if Leader McConnell -- the Senate Minority Leader, if he wants this to go through, he can find 10 moderates or those on his side who he can corral, bully, or browbeat. And secondly, what is his thinking? I mean, what does he expect is going to happen between the 7th of October and the middle of December that's going to change the landscape for getting it to pass more long term? RAJU: There's virtually nothing that's going to change over the next few weeks here because they are still in the same staring contest because there's a dispute over the process of raising the debt ceiling. Not the fact that has to be done, but the process. McConnell wants them to use -- Democrats use a budget process that will not require Republican votes. Democrats don't want to use that budget process because it's convoluted. It opens them up to a lot of politically charged amendment votes. And they say Republicans should own this as well because of the debt that was incurred during the Trump administration. So because of this procedural dispute, it's still going to exist in a couple of weeks where they have to deal with this again.

I think she among many people want to see what Robert Mueller gets to the bottom of. WHITFIELD: And Julian? ZELIZER: Look. I think she reminds every one of the basic question what was the role of Russia and what was the connection with the Trump campaign if any in that election and did it sway the outcome. That's the basic question that everyone should still be focused on and we need to hear from Robert Mueller in terms of what he has found. WHITFIELD: Greg, last word? BROWER: Yes.

The way in which he did it, however, raises very serious concerns.

22478,24593,CNN,Special Event,"who is your patron saint? I asked, was it John the Apostle? John the Baptist? Perhaps John Chrysostom? Because Cardinal O'Connor was very much like John Chrysostom in his preaching in confronting the age in which he lived. But he told me, no, it was John Fisher. Fisher was a 16th century bishop and finally a cardinal. He gave his life in defense of the truth, in obedience to his conscious. He disobeyed his earthly king, whom he loved and served loyally. He had been the king's tutor. But he had to obey a higher authority, the authority of Christ the King, his Savior. For that he suffered death. He was beheaded. When cardinals are created, the Holy Father tells us that the color red, which we take, is meant to be a reminder that we must be ready to shed our blood in defense of the faith in witness to Christ Jesus. The red is not just an honor, a reminder of that obligation to die for Christ. Cardinal O'Connor wasn't decapitated. He didn't die because of his faith. But he did proclaim it in season and out of season with strength and with courage and for that he did suffer. He was not afraid to speak in ways that were politically incorrect, to draw criticism from some. But he always did it with love, with comprehension. And while he's thought of as a very complex man with a subtle intellect, multi-faceted, he is finally a man very simple, consistent, a man who truly can be understood among all the great and good men of our times. As Cardinal Law so well illustrated, at the heart of his existence was the mystery of the Eucharist, the sacrament, sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ. It is in that that he found his daily nourishment, the strength, the sustenance that he required to carry out his ministry. It was at the heart of all that he did. Because in the Mass, everything is contained, the complete profession of faith, all that we believe and that we hope for and we have the gift of the body and blood of Christ. That body and that blood, that blood which was shed for us on Calvary, he lived in the light of that, and that is what sustained him. And it is another way of understanding what made John O'Connor the man that he was. He gave me an admonition, the same admonition he gave to Cardinal Law. The funeral Mass is not a memorial of John O'Connor, although one would think so because we speak of him so much and rightfully so.

Hillary Clinton getting a late break in the final hours of the campaign. The FBI director coming out, sending another letter to Congress, and this time he says, ""We looked at all the newly-discovered e-mails. There is nothing there."" There will be no indictment of Hillary Clinton based on the e-mail scandal. The cloud of suspicion, though, is still over her head. ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Well, and Donald Trump is still saying that the system is rigged and asking the American people to, quote, ""deliver justice"" at the polls. Both candidates are barnstorming battleground states in the final day of campaigning. Just one more day until the election. Let's begin with CNN justice correspondent Pamela Brown in Washington. Good morning, Pamela. PAMELA BROWN, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning to you, Alisyn. FBI investigators, under intense pressure, worked around the clock to review the large volume of e-mails that surfaced, according to sources. And key to this effort was software that was refined from its previous use for the initial private server investigation. As one official said, without this technology, this would have taken a lot longer. And it turns out most of the e-mails were personal or duplicate e- mails that had already been reviewed by the FBI. So, the probe is considered over for now when it comes to Hillary Clinton, with the FBI sticking to its initial recommendation of no charges. Though with not all of the deleted e-mails recovered and not all of the devices in the FBI's possession, it's always possible, of course, something else could turn up that would require more review. Now, as for the others who were part of the probe, including Huma Abedin, the FBI is still working on some remaining aspects of the review, including determining how the e-mails ended up on this laptop. We're told a ten-year-old laptop, an older one in the first place. Now, Abedin's attorney have said she doesn't know why these e-mails were there, because this wasn't a computer she used. So the expectations remain that investigators will have to talk to Abedin, again. And just to point out, it isn't uncommon to come across new evidence after concluding",0.71357733175915,2016-11-07

And it does the most important thing, Candy, which is it gives 98 percent of Americans the certainty your taxes aren't going to go up, and it gives us the chance to make sure we're protecting Medicare for future generations and it gives us the ability to lock in a set of carefully designed reforms that put us back on the path to fiscal balance. So its a very good plan, and we think it's a good basis for these conversations. CROWLEY: It's a starting point because when you look at it, the president said in September I am still willing to deal with Republicans and, you know, $2.50 worth of cuts for every dollar's worth of revenue raising. And this, of course, is nowhere near that. GEITHNER: No, that's not true. What we are proposing is very consistent with that. Which is we have roughly $2 of spending cuts if you include what's already been enacted. CROWLEY: Well, does that count here? I mean, if it's already enacted. GEITHNER: No, of course, it counts. CROWLEY: This is now -- that was your debt ceiling deal, correct? GEITHNER: No, that was - again let's just go back. And we've been having this conversation with Republicans for about 18 months. And from the beginning what we all agreed is we need roughly $4 trillion in savings over ten years. Now we've been doing that in stages. We did $1 trillion in spending cuts up front. And we proposed a balanced mix of change on the tax side and spending side to go beyond that, and look at it together, it's roughly two to one spending cuts versus tax increases. Now, we've been very detailed about what we can do on the spending side. We proposed $600 billion in cuts in health care programs, other mandatory programs over ten years. Now Republicans are -- we don't expect them to like all of these proposals, but all we can do is lay out what we belief in and then ask them to come back to us and tell us what they would prefer to do. CROWLEY: One of the things that the senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said was, listen, if you take higher premiums for the wealthy in Medicare, you increase the eligibility age in Medicare to eventually bring it to the parody of Social Security. If you slow the costs of living in Social Security and other entitlements thing we're at the table, we're dealing with revenue. That good with you, those things? GEITHNER: Well, you know, there are a lot of ideas out there - a lot of idea from Democrats, from Republicans. CROWLEY: Right, but how about these specific ones?

And there's all of the overcrowding at the facilities. So what if these two Florida counties were given proper funding and housing and supplies, might this actually be a decent idea? GUTIERREZ: You know what, Brooke, here is the decent idea. To give them a warm, welcoming, loving place. Because that is the way human beings treat one another. Especially the richest most powerful nation in the world. I mean sometimes I think the silence is deafening from the mayor of the city of Chicago and Mayor Rahm Emanuel and others who should be speaking up about welcoming them to the community. But we're a big nation, right, 50 states, right. And there are many people. But let's go back to the fact that most of them have family members here. Right. And what you or I or any other decent person would do is say, let's send them to the family members where they're going be treated with love and they're going to be able to integrate into society. And so they get their court date. Because they have proven that they have a credible fear of persecution and death. BALDWIN: I know. I know. I know. But it is the backlog and a lack of judges and -- (CROSSTALK) GUTIERREZ: I get it. So why aren't we employing more judges? Why aren't we putting more structures in place instead of denying what the problem is? Look, Brooke, I said this before and I'm going to say it again, the insatiable demand for drugs in America is what fuels the strength of the drug cartels. These are American weapons, American dollars that come from American citizens that funnel their way there. This is a -- a hemispheric problem. Let's deal with it as such.

And, again, an incredible picture here with the satellite -- this is the radar from Miami, 120 miles just to the east is a category 5 hurricane. The strongest so far on the planet this year, and now the second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever. Only one topped it, Allen, back in 1980 at 191 miles an hour. So, there is our five and they are in other colors, right. We got hurricane warnings from Boca Raton heading up into Cape Canaveral. And then we got hurricane watches that extend from Cape Canaveral through Daytona beach into Volusia County there and all the way into Jacksonville. And then the yellow you see here, tropical storm watch. Why? Well, because we think this is going to get close enough with the potential for winds in excess of 40 miles an hour, even tropical storm-force winds in Disney World for the next couple of days. The storm surge catastrophic. Some of the islands go up 10 feet. The storm surge is going to go up twice that height on top of them. And there you see the potential for South Florida and into Central Florida, the coastline anyway there as our category 5 begins to move further to the north. It's still not done that. It's still moving due west, right? So that turn is going to be critical and then there it goes, Tuesday 8 p.m. Look at this, a 24-hour difference east of West Palm and then east of Orlando. That turn is going to be crucial as to the effects in Florida. And again, once the steering currents begin to pull this the hurricane doesn't steer itself, but when it gets this strong, it kind of does. It's going to have that momentum; it's going to want to continue moving west. So, this is going to be just an incredibly close call here. And then again, paralleling the coast in a potential landfall from a -- by the time we get into Thursday and into next Friday. These are the latest computer model runs. Again, the center, that's where we have the 175, but the hurricane force-winds extend out 50 miles and then the tropical storm-force winds extend out 150 miles. So, keep that in mind. The center doesn't have to go on top of Florida to get significant effects. I'll leave with you this because this is our brand-new issue of the computer model, the European, that you're familiar with. And it still continues to track this storm just to the east, but notice so close those outer bands there that could contain not just tropical storm winds, but hurricane wind potential as well. And then, of course, you get the storm surge. That water has nowhere to go but Florida. So that's going to be an issue there as well. But the crucial day for tomorrow.

This includes all show and most husbandry interactions and our dining program. We will resume performances of our killer whale show, ""Believe,"" tomorrow at SeaWorld parks in Orlando, San Diego, and San Antonio, but our trainers will not enter the water.

It is a moment we're sort of focusing on trying to get whatever information we can from outside on the streets in Tripoli. We're still not permitted to go outside. And of course, in a situation like this when it's so volatile and there are so many armed groups including government loyalists out on the street in a high stake of tension nobody wants to go outside, actually, and see what's going on. But you know, we don't have to anyway. Because the fighting, it seems, is coming to us.

But on state television there in Libya there was an anchor woman who went on the air brandishing a weapon, talking about trying to fight for Gadhafi's regime as well. Can you elaborate on that? CHANCE: Yes. I mean just an indication of just how high the passions are running in this city. I think the channel was called El Libya. It's a state-run channel. I think it's owned by Colonel Gadhafi's son (INAUDIBLE). On it, you know, as fighting continued outside, there were shots apparently close to the television headquarters. The anchorwoman essentially pulled a pistol, waved it at the cameras and said that, you know, everybody in the television station was prepared to fight to the death. They would kill or be killed is what she started shouting at the cameras. And so it just gives you an indication of, you know, the level of emotion, the level of commitment amongst many of those people who are loyal to Colonel Gadhafi. Of course, as we've been witnessing across the whole country, you know, it's by no means, you know, the whole of the country that feels that way.

It's been going on now for a couple of hours, and man, it has gotten pretty heated at times, three key figures with very different accounts of what happened at Enron are facing another round of grilling by senators today. And among those testifying are former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling who has emerged as one of the key players in the company's demise. And also side by side, Sherron Watkins, the woman that sounded the alarms about the misdoings and basically has been pointing the finger at Skilling. Joining us with the latest from Capitol Hill, our congressional correspondent Kate Snow. Kate, this has actually been as good as billed, huh? KATE SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's been entertaining, hasn't it? It's been interesting, too. The three of them sitting side by side at one table, as you mentioned, Jeffrey Skilling sort of the key witness here, the highest level, highest ranking Enron official who has chosen to speak out and not take the Fifth. There you see him right there. That's a live picture coming to you there. At times, Mr. Skilling has corrected some of the senators. He has been a little bit tense with some of them, including an exchange just a short time ago with Senator Barbara Boxer of California. He questioned her records, as she was saying, about how much stock he had sold off. He got a little bit terse with her, saying, you know, how do you know those are the right figures? He started off telling the Senate committee that he had not lied to Congress. That was something that was suggested by some of the House members after he testified here a little over two weeks ago, and he also said he did not dupe Enron's board of directors and did not dupe former CEO Ken Lay, using that word, because that's what Sherron Watkins, the other woman at the it end of the table there on the left. She has accused Mr. Skilling of duping Mr. Lay and duping the board. Ms. Watkins and Mr. Skilling offered different accounts of had a happened at Enron. Watkins told the committee, in her opinion, Mr. Skilling was fully aware, very aware of what was being done in terms of the hedging going on, and in terms of the outside partnerships that Enron had formed. Skilling repeatedly said that yes, he was aware of those outside partnerships, but not really of the details and the way that they was actually structured, and in terms of the risk, he said he did not think there was much risk involved. In fact, he thought they were helping cover some of those risks by having those outside partnerships. He did not consider them overly risky.

The price is about $60. And the music, let's have some music. You can get a sense for the sound. A little tinnier sound. I mean not quite as rich or full as, say, the Bose or the other ones that we talked about here. But not bad for the price. COSTELLO: Boston. Right. SIEBERG: And, you know, pretty portable, obviously. And now the last one we have to talk about, this is pretty fun. This is definitely portable. You remember ""MacGyver,"" Carol? COSTELLO: Oh, I loved ""MacGyver."" SIEBERG: Right. He could like build a bulldozer out of a box of screws and some matches. Yes. So they had a contest. ""Ready Made"" magazine had a contest. The idea was to make something out of an Altoids box that worked, that functioned. And what we've got here are some speakers that will work with your iPod. I'm going to stop talking and see if you can hear it. You can hear that, Carol? COSTELLO: Yes. That doesn't sound as good as the other speakers, but it's in an Altoids box. SIEBERG: You're right. But for $5? It's $5, keep in mind, OK? He actually designed this out of some Altoids box, some playing cards and some old headphones. The total price, $5. COSTELLO: That's pretty good.

COSTELLO: That's funny. SIEBERG: Pretty creative. COSTELLO: OK, this is one I want to ask you about. SIEBERG: Yes, sure. COSTELLO: Because I like the speaker set you showed us with the battery, because my iPod battery does not seem to last very long. SIEBERG: Right. Well, interestingly enough, these -- a lot of them act as a battery charger for your iPod, as well. So it's a place to store your iPod, but also to charge it. So you can actually use the A.C. power, listen to your iPod and it's going to charge it while it's in there. If you take the A.C. power out, I believe the Monster iSpeaker, it lasts about eight hours on two AA batteries. That's this really sort of portable one here that looks like a couple of CD cases.

Oscar Pistorius, not guilty of murder. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oscar Pistorius, as you`ve never seen him before. And in these pictures uncovered by Sky News, the athlete shows his prowess at handling a gun. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Take responsibility for what you`ve done. OSCAR PISTORIUS, OLYMPIC ATHLETE: I`ll take responsibility by me waiting and not willing risk my life but waiting for my time on this stand to tell my story for the respect of Reeva. (END VIDEO CLIP) GRACE: That was Oscar Pistorius. You can hardly understand a thing he says. Probably because he was crying or, excuse me, snotting his way through his courtroom appearance in front of the judge. Sometimes even lying down on the floor. Having to have his psych, his shrink come and rub his head and his hair. All right, you`d think that didn`t work. Well, guess what? That interspersed with all that ma lady, ma lady, ma lady to the judge. He`s walking on murder charges. Boom. That is the verdict. From the bench, no jury. Now, the jury, the jury is still out, on whether he will be convicted of a lesser charge. But he is walking, not guilty, on murdering his lover, model, Reeva Steenkamp. Straight out to Noma Bolani, reporter, SABC, in court. Noma, thank you for being with us. Was everybody stunned? NOMA BOLANI, REPORTER, SABC RADIO: Yes, I think everybody was kind of shocked by the judgment that was given by Thokozile Masipa. A lot of (INAUDIBLE) debating if whether she made the right reasoning in terms of her findings. Many of them saying that from her findings she should have been able to find, you know, a case of murder (INAUDIBLE) with someone who actions where he should have perceived that if he had pulled that trigger and shot through -- four shots through the door, he would have killed someone, because he already knew there was someone behind the door. GRACE: Right. With me, Noma Bolani, joining me from Pretoria. Also with us, Mandy Weiner, Eyewitness News senior reporter and co-author of ""Tragic Night: The Oscar Pistorius Murder Trial."" Also in court. Mandy, what was so amazing to me is why we have the jury system here in America, that this judge actually said from the bench, that she chose to disbelieve all of the witnesses that heard a woman screaming and chose to believe that that was Oscar Pistorius. That somehow, with his deep voice that we heard in court, when he starts screaming, he sounds like a girl. Really? MANDY WEINER, EYEWITNESS NEWS SENIOR REPORTER: Well, of course, this is the big difference between South Africa and America, the fact that we have a judge system and you have a jury system.

Obviously we will continue to check back in with you. Chris. CUOMO: All right, and at this point we just try to go on what we can learn from the various authorities and investigators. And things will be ruled out in their own course and time. The question here now is, whenever something happens abroad, what reflective impact does it have back in the United States? What does this mean as a reflection of what we're dealing with, with these recent TSA problems? We have U.S. Senator Dick Durbin. He's next on NEW DAY. He has great perspective on how this investigation will proceed abroad and what it means to you right here at home. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news. CUOMO: We are following breaking news here surrounding the apparent crash of Egyptian Air 804. We're now hearing that Egyptian and Greek military assets are furiously searching the Mediterranean for this plane. It vanished off radar just about 12 hours ago. The Egyptian aviation minister is now saying it is more likely that the plane was brought down by terror than by a technical failure. But we do not know that that speculation is based on any information that is not known to us at this point. Because as far as we know, investigators and authorities in France and Greece are not going that far. They know certain things about the plane before it went off radar, but not that necessarily dictate a conclusion. Something else that's in the wind this morning about why this might have happened is the security situation at Charles de Gaulle Airport. This flight took off from Paris and was supposed to go to Cairo. Let's discuss this now with Illinois senator Dick Durbin. He's on the Senate Appropriations Transportation Subcommittee. He knows a lot about the TSA. I'm actually in your home state of Illinois. We're going to be talking to Secretary Clinton later on this afternoon in a sit-down interview. This will come up, but the context, the TSA, right here in Illinois, right here in Chicago, there are a lot of problems and confusions and frustrations, senator, about waiting time.

(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) CUOMO: No one's going to protect your children's health but you. Well, children aren't affected. Oh really? That's another fact that they're going to change on us. Now we're worrying about we have 93 cases that we're investigating of young children who have COVID- related diseases. (END VIDEOCLIP) KING: 93 cases in New York State alone and there could be even more we don't know about just yet. Dr. Deepika Thacker is a Pediatric Cardiologist with the Nemours Children Health System in Delaware. Doctor, thank you so much for being with us. Walk us through what you're seeing and the link to coronavirus. And as the governor said early on, people were saying, well, children are more safe. Children seem more immune. Maybe not the case? DEEPIKA THACKER, MEDICAL DIR. OF CARDIAC INPATIENT UNIT, NEMOURS CHILDREN'S HEALTH SYSTEM: John, I think we are seeing the cases of the actual coronavirus infecting children while we are saying they may be milder than adults, what we are seeing now is an immune-mediated response in these children. So the initial viral infection may still be mild but sometimes their body is reacting with an immune response which is - which can be quite severe. These children are presenting with what we're now calling the pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome possibly associated with COVID-19. So high fevers, abdominal pain, headache, shortness of breath, sometimes rash and conjunctivitis. KING: And so, the symptoms are on the screen right now. A parent should be looking for these. Anything else? I mean, some of those symptoms do overlap with what were told about coronavirus. Watch for a high fever and the like, but what are different in the sense that if you're parent watching at home and you think your kid has been isolated but is showing some symptoms, what should you do? THACKER: You know, I think that's - I think parents should use their instincts, and if your child has any of those symptoms it would be worth while connecting with your - with your child's doctor. Many of them can even do video calling now. Here at Nemours, we have an app called Care Connect for our telemedicine system. We are available 24/7. But if the child appears really sick with shortness of breath, with severe headaches, vomiting, then probably head over to the nearest children's hospital for immediate attention. KING: And - (CROSSTALK) THACKER: These children may appear well in the beginning but can deteriorate pretty rapidly, but again with good care they do very well. KING: All right, Dr. Thacker.

I thank God for our police and their protection of us. I pray that they will function in less racial fear and as that happens, we will see less of the kind of injustices and fractures like we've seen with Eric Garner, I think it's sad, with Trayvon Martin, I know that wasn't the police. But because we live with so much racial fear, there is a problem on our hands and our nation. And I think the church uniting cross- racially as church like heaven on earth will help make a big difference in racial fear in our country. PAUL: Yes, we'll have to see. BLACKWELL: Not only black lives matter but all lives matter. Pastors, thank you both. BEARD: Right, all lives matter, absolutely. MCBRIDE: Love you, Brother Chris, have a great day.

BLACKWELL: CNN's Candy Crowley joins us now from Washington. Candy, we saw the sabotage and infighting this weekend. Clearly, a sign of things to come in 2015. CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is but, you know, most of the infighting was the most interesting. When you looked at the split in the Democratic Party between sort of the Elizabeth Warren wing, progressives, who objected to what they felt was a bank bailout in this spending bill, and you saw Republicans objecting because they don't want to fund, among other things, they don't want to fund the president's, quote, ""amnesty program"" as they call it. So, most of the fireworks and a lot of the enmity was certainly intraparty and it tells you that not just next year, but 2016, both these parties are working and will be fighting to identify what they really stand for and who they are, which wing of the party becomes dominant, so much of that depends on the nominee. Nonetheless, you will see a lot of back and forth inside these parties, 2015 and 2016. PAUL: So, give us an assessment, how do you think Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will do next month when he comes back to all of this? CROWLEY: The one thing about the incoming majority chief, Senator McConnell, is that he is a tactician. He understands the Senate and he loves the Senate.

Can the government through its meetings today, these high level meetings, begin to put back, build confidence in them? It's going to be a very tough job, Becky. It is really divided right now. [11:10:ANDERSON: Yeah. Thank you, Nic. Arwa, as Nic and I have been discussing, likely the state of emergency was considered at this security meeting. We are yet to find out exactly what will be announced. That meeting just finished. I'm just wondering, how will people feel about that state of emergency, do you think? Look, we don't know what kind of form it might take were it to be -- were it to be imposed, but this was a party that was elected on a sort of premise of we ended the state of emergency in Turkey, et cetera, et cetera. I'm just wondering how it's going to go down, do you think, were that to be announced? DAMON: Well, Becky, let's go back to the night of the coup just briefly where you did see what can only be described as rare unity amongst a heavily divided Turkish population and even rarer unity amongst the country's leading political blocs where they all effectively came together and said no matter how we feel about President Erdogan himself, we do not want to see a violent military coup bring down his government. This is a democracy that too many people have worked too hard to see built. But the unity basically ends there. So all of the government's actions after the coup have proven to be as divisive as Erdogan himself is. His supporters, most likely, will welcome a state of emergency. His opponents will find it to be a concerning development because they don't know what that is going to mean and whether or not his government would, as his opponents would say, use this to try to increase his own power. ANDERSON: Arwa Damon is in Istanbul, Nic in Ankara for you. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to sit down with President Erdogan in his first interview since the attempted coup. And amongst other things, I asked him why the plotters thought they could succeed and how did he not know about the plan? This is what he had to say.

A utility meter reader stumbles on a tiny human skeleton, including a skull covered in light-colored hair, the killer duct-taping and placing a heart-shaped sticker directly over the mouth, then triple-bagging little Caylee like she`s trash. Bombshell tonight. Tot mom`s lawyers do it again. First they announce they`ll put tot mom`s best friend on the hot seat, demanding friend Amy Huizenga go under oath. That`s going to boomerang. The best friend was with tot mom the whole month she partied out of control while Caylee`s missing. And the friend`s an eyewitness to nights when tot mom actually brought 2-year-old Caylee to booze drinks parties and poker parties. Tot mom told the friend a string of lies, went so far to set up an explanation for the smell of death in her car, even stealing that friend`s checks for a shopping spree at Target for beer and push-up bras. But now they give notice they want another incriminating witness under oath. Tot mom`s longtime childhood friend, Kiomarie Cruz, Cruz set to testify tot mom wanted desperately to put little Caylee up for adoption, tot mom never wanted the baby. But grandmother Cindy stood in the way. Cruz also set to spill the beans that after knowing tot mom for years, she never heard of any nanny Zenaida Gonzalez. She describes a contentious relationship between grandmother Cindy and tot mom over the years and how tot mom would do anything to spite her. Does that include murdering the one thing grandmother Cindy loved the most? We also confirm four Orange County jail officers set to go under oath, including the ones with tot mom when she sees live coverage of the discovery of Caylee`s remains, immediately asking for medication for herself. And tonight, revealed, one of the only trials tot mom`s lead defense attorney ever tried was another murder of a 2-year-old little girl. And that client complains it`s Baez`s fault he`s behind bars tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Casey, do you still think you`re an unfit mother?

I asked them at the ceremony about what does this mean for Israel's air capabilities in the region? I asked this to one of the Lockheed Martin people on site. And, of course, he has a stake in this, but he said, if you compare the F-35 to the F-16, which Israel has now, it is like comparing the iPhone 7 to a flip phone. Brooke? BALDWIN: OK.

LA MONICA: Boeing with Air Force One. Now Lockheed Martin. I think investors have reason to be concerned that Trump is going to do this increasingly. Even though this is not the first time that any politicians have attacked Lockheed over the cost of the F-35. This has been a bipartisan issue. John McCain in April calling it a disgrace because of the cost overruns and delays. So, this is not the first time and it won't be the last because the F-35 had lots of problems.

There hasn't been any good will towards President Bush, probably, since Hurricane Katrina. And I think the American public really wants this president to succeed. Equally as important, we're going to find a very, very disciplined, very bright man who has a great ability to communicate with the American public. The problems are immense. The talent around him is immense. And I, to a certain extent -- hopefully they can all hit the road at the same time. I think -- I think we're going to see a lot of -- it's going to be a long, hard battle out here, but I think this president has the potential of being an historic president, and hopefully our prayers and our good will is all with him. BLITZER: Will America's enemies, Ed, test this president, early on? ROLLINS: I think that will come, I think, in the crazy world we live in today. But I'm very confident that, if John McCain would have been elected, at least two of the three members -- I don't think Secretary of State Clinton would be there, but I think, certainly Bill (sic) Gates and Jim Jones would be there, so it would be the same kind of team. And I think, to a certain extent, Americans rally behind a president in a time of national crisis. And if we get tested, whoever tests us better beware.

I'm guessing it really doesn't matter what the reason was. As we say, it's never too late to do the right thing, as Oscar Munoz said. It's what Wendy Walsh called the seismic shift in American corporate culture, that such behavior is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, there will be consequences.

His funds have returned 30 percent annually after fees. Even with its recent problems, a $100,000 investment with Tiger in 1980 would have been worth $8 million at the end of last month. Robertson made billions sniffing out bargains or shorting overvalued stocks, a true value investor who stuck by his guns to the end. ROBERTSON: In the long run, anybody that wants to buy value now and do it hard and effectively will make a bloody fortune. (END VIDEOTAPE) CLARKIN: Now, I asked Robertson if he would care to name some of the Internet or technology companies that he believes are ripe for a fall, but he declined. But he did stress that until prices somehow valued in some of those stocks, the potential for -- quote, his word here -- a ""collapse"" is great -- Stuart, Willow. BAY: Now, of course, this is a man who has been through this before. CLARKIN: Yes, he pointed to a time in 1987 where he had shorted four biotechnology stocks. They rose 90 percent in one quarter. So he's had a lot of apologizing to do. But today, he thinks three of those companies are out of business. BAY: Sad day for Tiger. VARNEY: As the selling accelerated on the Nasdaq, so did the buying in the bond market. Investors took a flight to the safety of U.S. Treasuries, sending the yield on the long bond plunging to a seven-month low. The 30-year issued soared more than a full point. That puts the yield down to 5.87 percent. The 10-year note surged as well. It was up nearly a point. The market seemed unfazed by the latest evidence of a superstrong economy. GDP expanded by 7.3 percent on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of '99, the fastest pace since 1984. BAY: Alan Greenspan may think today's pullback is exactly what Wall Street and the economy need. Three years after his infamous ""irrational exuberance"" speech, the Fed chairman is still worried about the impact of high stock prices. In a letter to the House Banking Committee released today, the Fed chairman wrote: ""The sharp increase in equity valuation appears to have been an important factor behind an apparently developing imbalance."" But he did deny any suggestion that the Fed is jawboning or targeting stock prices. He also urged caution when it comes to margin debt, amid speculation that the Fed could tighten margin requirements. VARNEY: Many Internet stocks escaped today's sell-off, but not Yahoo!.

I was simply making the point that we have to move public opinion. We have to feel a sense of urgency. Ultimately Congress will follow the people. And we have to stop being confused about this. At some point as a country, we have to reckon with what happens. It is not good enough simply to show sympathy. You don't see murder on this kind of scale with this kind of frequency in any other advanced nation on earth. Every country has violent, hateful or mentally unstable people. What's different is not every country is awash with easily accessible guns. And so I refuse to act as if this is the new normal or to pretend that it's simply sufficient to grieve and that any mention of us doing something to stop it is somehow politicizing the problem. We need a change in attitudes. Among everybody -- lawful gun owners, those who are unfamiliar with guns. We have to have a conversation about it and fix this. And ultimately Congress acts when the public insists on action. And we've seen how public opinion can change. We've seen it on gay marriage. We've seen it beginning to change on climate change. We have to shift how we think about this issue. And we have the capacity to change, but we have to feel a sense of urgency about it. We as a people have got to change. That's how we honor those families. That's how we honor the families in Newtown. That's how we honor the families in Aurora. Now, the first time I spoke in this conference in 2008, I said that America would be succeeding despite Washington, they should be succeeding with some help from Washington. As president, I've made it a priority to partner with mayors like you. BLITZER: So the president making his statement on Charleston once again making a very strong, very strong statement in favor of more gun control here in the United States. Similar to what he said yesterday, although I think it was a bit more robust today in front of all of these mayors. We're going to continue to monitor what he's saying. He's moving to other subjects right now but I want to get some quick reaction to what we just heard from the president of the United States.

You're watching CNN, the most trusted name in news. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEMON: There you have it. You're looking at live pictures happening in Iowa right now. Former health and human services secretary, Tommy Thompson, expected to announce his presidency. He made an official announcement this morning in Wisconsin, but he's expected to do it again here in Iowa. As soon as that happens, we're going to bring it to you live.

Susan Lisovicz, at the New York Stock Exchange with all the details on what it means for you and for all of us -- Susan. LISOVICZ: Hey, Don. Well, it couldn't happen at a worse time. The government suing the operators of more than 125 Jackson Hewitt tax preparation offices, accusing them of filing fraudulent tax returns on behalf of their clients. The government calling it massive and pervasive fraud. The complaints target five franchises that operate offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit and Raleigh-Durham, as well as 24 individuals who manage or work at those franchises. Investigators accuse the defendants of encouraging bogus tax returns by claiming fake deductions and tax credits. The lawsuits also allege that some of the franchise employees took kickbacks from customers for helping them file fraudulent returns. All told, the government says it's been cheated out of more than $70 million. As for Jackson Hewitt, the company says the complaints are limited to just one franchise out of 125 -- Don.

MARK EIGLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: I think the prosecutor who, with utmost love and respect, I say his ego is not his amigo, will likely go over the top and try to claim something that he has failed to prove, which is that he should never have used deadly force because he didn't reasonably fear death or great bodily harm. Unfortunately for him, as the world now sees, the evidence seems to suggest just the opposite. They've established, the defense did, even prior to the defendant taking the witness stand, that he did reasonably fear death or great bodily harm and legally had the right to use deadly force in each of the three instances that he used it. I think this is going to be a fairly quick acquittal. SCIUTTO: Let me ask you though, Mark, because the prosecutors have stated that they may seek for the jury to consider lesser charges. They could range from second-degree intentional homicide down to second-degree reckless homicide. And I understand there might be a difference in the charges based on each of the people that Rittenhouse killed based on those circumstances. Do you believe that the prosecution has made the case for any of those lesser charges? EIGLARSH: No. It doesn't matter. Don't get lost in the weeds on what those charges are. If he was justified in using force, it doesn't matter. The jurors will reject any other charges that are put in front of them. The key issue is whether he was justified or not. The only concern that I have as a trial lawyer is when they throw out anything that could possibly stick is that jurors sometimes -- and I don't think it's going to happen here -- will say, all right, they didn't prove the main charge but maybe as a compromise, we'll hit him with one of the lesser charges. I don't think they're going to do that here. And, quite frankly, I think it's unfair for the prosecutor to throw those out when the primary issue is whether he used reasonable force, and, quite frankly, I think he did. HILL: You said it's not too early to wonder whether this was really a waste of taxpayer dollar and judicial resources. The families of the victims, though, obviously, are looking for justice. What do you say to them? EIGLARSH: I say to them, first of all, I'm sorry for your loss. I mean, obviously, I don't think he did the best actions by taking a gun and going to that scene. I don't think he was needed. I think he put himself in harm's way and others. That's not what he's on trial for. He's on trial for whether he committed murder, whether he was justified in using force, and I would tell these families, I am so sorry for your loss, but on a legal level, which is the only thing",0.1985126529244176,2021-11-12

So the delegate count at least in this race -- put the delegate count up for me if you will. So, in the delegates to date, you have Amy Klobuchar who has seven delegates, right? You have Elizabeth Warren who has 20 delegates and you have Tulsi Gabbard who has one delegate. And then you have Bernie Sanders who has 245, Joe Biden 321, Pete Buttigieg 26, and then you have Mayor Michael Bloomberg who has four delegates. I want to bring it now to the women who are here to talk about that. You have these women, these very strong, very powerful, very smart women in this race. You had Hillary Clinton, who is defeated despite winning the popular vote. You have Elizabeth Warren who didn't do well, Amy Klobuchar who has dropped out of this race. You had this very diverse Democratic Party and then you have the women, you have all the white guys who have the delegates. What's going on here? KUCINICH: You know, Klobuchar had just really small amount of time to really use that debate an amazing debate -- that amazing debate performance she had where everyone kind of took notice and allowed her to, you know, plow through and finish third in New Hampshire, and then she really wasn't able to make the most of it. She really wasn't able to catch fire and that really isn't her fault. I mean, she didn't have the money to spend in some of these states. Now, Elizabeth Warren it's fascinating, because she had the ground game that everybody envied in Iowa, in New Hampshire, in several of these states. She had been working on this forever and if you look at the spending in some of the states. LEMON: She still has money now. She still have money. KUCINICH: She still has money, but she also has a high burn rate. So, and she's already planning to go to places like Michigan, like Arizona and she already has those on the calendar. We know that it doesn't really matter, but in theory she's planning on going forward. The fact that this ground game did not turn out votes for her, did not get people to the polls for Elizabeth Warren is really -- there's really a lot of digging as to why that didn't happen, whether it's sexism, whether it's the fact someone did just changed their mind. I heard women when I was in Iowa tell me we're Warren fans, were worried that people -- they liked Warren, they heard her speak. They went to the polls and then they were worried that a woman couldn't beat Donald Trump. LEMON: But you're reading my mind.

And what they do, they take it frame by frame, and they`re going to go ahead and follow and trace exactly from where Kelsey went when she left the store.

And, you know, Republicans may not be raising alarms like Democrats are today, because it happened to us. But the Russians are not sympathizers of the Republican Party. They are going to try to manipulate elections with respect to how it affects them at the immediate time and moment. You know, two years or four years from now, it may be that the Russians are trying to manipulate elections against Republicans. So this really shouldn't be a partisan issue; this should be an American issue. And I don't know: It disturbs me when I hear the chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the House say he doesn't know who Roger Stone or Carter Page are. That doesn't sound like a fair investigation, if the guy in charge of the investigation doesn't understand who some of the key players are. BLITZER: Yes, he said once again the Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story. On the other hand, Senator, do you worry that, without confirmation of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians, Democrats are taking this line of questioning too far; they're trying to damage the credibility of the sitting president? MURPHY: Well, listen, like I said, I hope there wasn't any evidence of collusion. But as Representative Schiff laid out for everyone to hear today, you know, every day there is a new drip, drip of connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Many connections that were denied by the campaign and the administration until they were revealed by good reporting. So I hope that we don't find that connection, but I think we owe it to the American public to find it. And listen, we also have to keep our eye on all the other important things that are happening here. Right? We can't let this story dominate this week, because on Thursday, the House of Representatives is going to vote to strip health care away from 24 million Americans. So we have to find a way to be able to focus on the Russian investigation while also talking about the other damaging things that are happening to the American public right now. BLITZER: If the Russian president, Vladimir Putin's, goal was to sow chaos, disruption, within the United States, do you worry this kind of questioning so publicly accomplished that goal? MURPHY: Well, listen, I think we have to get to the bottom of this. And right now, we are in an investigatory phase that is absolutely necessary. What worries me is that, as we speak, Putin is not just trying to destabilize the American system of government. He's doing that all throughout Europe. He's doing it all throughout the Balkans.

COOPER: Were there any jokes you killed at the last minute because they were edgy or you suddenly got cold feet on them? KIMMEL: Yes, there were -- you know, there were some jokes, some things were with played better than others. It seemed like people liked the simpler jokes. You know, I had a lot of kind of inside jokes that maybe I skipped by a little bit, because people seemed to be squarely focused on Kim Kardashian.

Mike, you've had such an extensive background in law enforcement, also with the FBI. What do you make of this? MIKE BROOKS, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT: I think Arian is a major player, and so does some folks within federal law enforcement. They told me they feel like he's a major player. We go back, we look at Arian, he came to the United States back in 1975, but he started falling under the look of the FBI microscope right around 1995 when he and an associate of his, Ramadan Sale (ph), also known as Abdullah Sale (ph) started up a group called -- there was a think tank at the University of South Florida called WISE, the World Islamic Studies Enterprise, and that's when they started looking at him. But a lot of people will ask, well, why did they take so long? And that's a very good question, why did it take so long from 1995 until now for the FBI to make an arrest, when the Attorney General Ashcroft said this enterprise, this racketeering enterprise has been going on since 1984? Well, it takes quite a bit of intelligence information and investigative beating the bushes, if you will, by investigators to find out exactly if there's any criminality involved, and that's the main thing, Kyra, even when you're talking about a terrorism case, is trying to find out if there is any criminality. PHILLIPS: Will agents be -- he's been here since 1975, so could this go even further back? BROOKS: Well, it could. And agents have been looking into that, and I'm sure they looked into that over the last almost eight years. But when they first opened up -- the way -- let me explain the way the investigation kind of comes to life, if you will, within the FBI. They will get some intelligence information, maybe some source information about someone who may be involved, maybe allegedly involved in a criminal enterprise. They'll open up a preliminary inquiry, a preliminary investigation. They'll use the most unobtrusive means possible to see what this person is about. They'll run some background checks. They'll check into when he came into the country, what kind of things he's been doing since he got into the country, and from there, they'll start to develop their case. And to develop their case and make it into a full investigation, a full field investigation, it takes, you know, wiretaps, it takes a lot of these things. All these are under court orders, because they have to be careful as to not -- to make sure they do not trample on his civil rights here, being in the United States.

The picture in this state looking pretty different than a lot of other different parts of the country. The positivity rate has shrunk to less than 1 percent. That means New York City can now proceed to phase two of the reopening. It means, among other things, that people can go back to their offices at 50 percent capacity. New York City real estate will come back. Salons and barbershops will be open. I know a few people who have been looking forward to that. And, of course, the much-awaited fact that people will be able to sit outside at bars and restaurants across the city. However, Governor Cuomo is warning that COVID, of course, is not over, that we need to keep an eye on the infection rate. That testing needs to continue. That we need to be aware of the possibility of infection coming in from other states, and that of course, people need to be vigilant about the possibility of a second wave of the virus. To enforce social distancing here in New York, the governor has signed additional executive orders. That would mean that bars and restaurants could see their liquor licenses revoked if they do not comply with regulations. Businesses that don't comply with regulations could also be temporarily shut down. And John, on a personal note. I'm very pleased to report that the coffee shop behind me will be opening in just another hour. You'll be able to find us sitting outside. BERMAN: No question about that. Alexandra Field for us on the streets of New York, thank you very much. All right. Breaking overnight, a really troubling story.

LEMON: And I'm Don Lemon. It's a busy hour right here in the CNN NEWSROOM. PHILLIPS: And, happening right now, we want to take you to the courtroom, live pictures. What happened in the last moments of Jessie Davis' life and the life of her unborn baby? We're learning more now, as we wait for her accused killer to appear right here in court. It was moments ago we saw the family of Jessie Davis enter the courtroom. The Porters are now there. Davis' body was found in a northern Ohio national park over the weekend. This is the man accused of killing her, nine months pregnant. Canton police officer Bobby Cutts is his name. He's charged with killing her at her home and causing the death of their unborn child. Cutts is also the father of Davis' 2-year-old son and is believed to have fathered the baby that Jessie Davis was carrying. Cutts' former high school classmate, Myisha Ferrell, also accused of obstructing justice. Both are due in court. Let's take a listen in.

Tom, I don't know if you were able to hear exactly what the judge said. I heard $5 million bond. What's the next step for Bobby Cutts, the man accused of killing his girlfriend and their unborn baby? TOM MCKEAN, FORMER PROSECUTOR: Well, they continued the case until July 2. I think what will happen, there will be a presentation before a grand jury. The defense counsel got appointed today.

Now to our roundtable, fascinating people I've wanted to have on for GPS for a while, all of whom have written on extensively and incisively on Iran. Timothy Garton Ash is perhaps the most prominent intellectual in Europe. He's written nine books chartering the continent's recent political history. He's a professor at Oxford. He writes a weekly column for the British newspaper, ""The Guardian"". Roger Cohen is a columnist for ""The New York Times."" He's written for more than a dozen countries, but most recently on Iran. This past summer, he wrote memorably and movingly about the pro-democracy demonstrations that rocked that country. Reuel Marc Gerecht is a former Middle East specialist at the CIA. I published him once pseudonymously at Foreign Affairs many, many years ago. He's a frequent contributor to ""The Weekly Standard"" and many would consider him a fiery neoconservative. Welcome all. What do you think is the state of play with Iran right now? I mean, just factually, where are we in the - in the - in the negotiations and the process? TIMOTHY GARTON ASH, AUTHOR, ""FACTS ARE SUBVERSIVE"": Right now there are at least two governments in Iran. It's a deeply divided regime. Pillars of the regime like Ayatollah Rafsanjani are now in a conflict with the Revolutionary Guards. Unfortunately, this time, we got it the wrong way around. ZAKARIA: Wait, explain that, because... ASH: Well, I mean that the moment to engage is when you want to prise open that regime, encourage the forces for change, not at the moment when the forces for change have already exploded, and what all the Iranian opposition is saying to us is do not legitimize Ahmadinejad at this moment. It's the worst thing you can do. ROGER COHEN, THE NEW YORK TIMES: If I may, I don't think - what is - there is - there is no legitimacy. It's ultimately a force of arms, it's ultimately the monopoly of a force that has preserved this government. And I don't think the view of the Iranian people of the Ahmadinejad presidency, you know, is significant altered. I think they will continue to press for reform, for opening and that will be encouraged, ultimately, if we can break this deadline. ASH: If Obama met with Ahmadinejad at the United Nations... COHEN: Well, that's unthinkable. ASH: ... that will be a slap in the face for the Iranian people. So, you do have to watch out, I think. I am actually for negotiations, although I don't think they'll get anywhere. But bear in mind the impact of everything you do on people who are obsessed with the United States. REUEL MARC GERECHT, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES: Yes. I was just going to say, I mean, pro-Americanism is so great in Iran, amongst the Iranian people, and has been accelerating over the last two decades in great part because the United States has been seen as being hostile to the theocracy.

I don't know what you all would like -- QUESTION: Do you feel you have an obligation before the Impeachment Committee. Just to be clear for transparent reasons? BURRIS: If they had asked me and not taken me into a different direction, and followed up, if Durkin had followed up with another question. I don't know where we went. The transcript was short. We didn't stay in that area? I didn't even -- I was then thinking of the process. That had -- that whole name just had passed. And I was passing then to concentrate because of Representative Flowers asked me a question about pay to play or something like that. And so -- and then there was a big discussion. And so nobody ever came back to the list of names. QUESTION: You are blaming the committee for -- BURRIS: I'm not blaming anybody. I'm just stating what happened. QUESTION: Did you think at all before you got the transcript? Did it weigh on you at all you had actually talked to the brother of the governor? BURRIS: Because what I --when I talked to Rob Blagojevich about was about fund-raising. And I advised him that I couldn't do it so there was nothing there to talk about. QUESTION: You didn't think about -- you didn't think back to that question in your own mind? Wasn't that weighing on you? BURRIS: You are trying to see what's in my mind. The answer is no. QUESTION: It didn't dawn on you? Isn't that the whole point of bringing it before -- BURRIS: The Impeachment Committee? Was what? QUESTION: Wasn't that the whole point? BURRIS: No. The point -- they told us what they wanted to talk about how I got the appointment. That's what -- that's what we responded in our first affidavit. The Impeachment Committee's inquiry, so we couldn't come on the Wednesday because we were in Washington. And we sent an affidavit and tried to be in compliance. A voluntary affidavit telling them about the appointment. No contact was made in reference to the appointment. So we go to the Impeachment Committee talking about the appointment. Then the Republicans who I say probably want to be partisan and political here, opened this thing up about who did you talk to when? I had to start thinking about who I had talked to when. And that's the reason why, you know, some of this was coming back to me. But I said, well, yes. I talked to at the fund-raiser, Blagojevich, was in June or July. I don't know when it was. I went to Doug Schofield and said, Doug, put a good word in for the governor because I'm interested in the Senate seat if Barack wins. I saw Doug Schofield -- is it Doug? Schofield.

And she told us, that she said that the government has decided to hunt down. She never set assassinate or eliminate, but she said to hunt down all those who were directly or indirectly connected to Munich and all those people that had blood on their hands. RAZ: The operation is where Steven Spielberg's film takes off, based loosely on a book by George Jonas written about the events. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eleven Palestinian names. RAZ: Loosely, because the storyline is almost entirely made up. It's kind of a Hollywood take on the moral qualms of one of the Israeli hitmen. It's this aspect of the film that slightly annoys Anke Spitzer, whose husband, Andre, was one of the murdered athletes. SPITZER: There is a problem in the movie. And in my opinion, for the viewers, it will be very, very difficult to understand that the Munich part is historically based and the other part of the Mossad action afterwards, it's fiction. RAZ: It's thought that about 18 people suspected of involvement in the massacre were assassinated by Israeli agents. DAVID KIMCHE, FORMER MOSSAD CHIEF: It had nothing to do with vengeance, it had nothing to do with reprisals; it has everything to do with the prevention of more terror attacks against innocent people. RAZ: Most Israelis vehemently backed the assassinations. (on camera): They backed it because the 1972 Munich massacre was regarded as one of the most traumatic moments in Israeli history. And to this day, the tragedy is marked right here at the grave site of those murdered athletes. (voice-over): Spielberg's film has been attacked for what critics claim is the moral equivalents drawn between the murder of the athletes and the assassination of the terrorists. In an interview with the ""Los Angeles Times,"" Spielberg said, quote, ""I just wanted to put empathy in every direction because the situation is not cut and dry."" But Spielberg also added, he supports Israel's response to the attack. But for Anke Spitzer and the other relatives, Spielberg's mistake was not consulting them. SPITZER: I told him. I said, look, I said the minimum what you could have done is inform us what is going to happen. You are making a movie, but for us, Munich is our life tragedy. RAZ: Guy Raz, CNN, Tel-Aviv.

The safest place for children is in a school building. And what we want to do is not get in the way of preventing children from coming into that building. MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT (D), CHICAGO: Fundamentally what we cannot do is abandon the science. We know that the safest place for kids to be is in-person learning in schools. And we've spent hundreds of millions of dollars to make our schools safe. They are safe. We've got the data that demonstrate that. We've got to get the teachers' union to get real and get serious about getting back into in-person learning. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROMERO: Let's talk about that science that you heard both of the mayors talking about in Chicago and New York. Across the country we're seeing pediatric hospitalizations for kids who are 5 and younger, so that age group not eligible for vaccinations up about 48 percent when you compare December 4 through January 1st. So just that -- about a month period, the largest increase in pediatric hospitalizations we've seen, Fred, throughout the course of this pandemic, and tomorrow is yet another day when a lot of kids around the country will not be back in school because the school districts and the cities are still fighting on what to do, what they think is best. WHITFIELD: All right. Thank you so much, Natasha Chen and Nadia Romero, appreciate that. All right. Let's discuss this further. With us now, Dr. Julie Morita. She is a former member of the Biden-Harris transition team and the executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Good to see you. I wonder where you are. Are you in agreement with the mayors of New York and Chicago who say they are following the science and the safest place is in-person schooling for kids? Do you agree with that? DR. JULIE MORITA, EVP, THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION: Hi, Fred. Thanks so much for having me today. So I think it's really -- you referenced earlier today and what's happening in the L.A. School districts and what we can see is THAT when the appropriate systems are in place, children can be in a school setting and teachers can be in a school setting safely. So having required vaccinations, making sure there's good ventilation, making sure that children are wearing a mask, that there's appropriate test capacity so we that can actually identify children and teachers who are sick. When those systems are in place, children and teachers can be safely in the school environment. But those systems have to be in place.

In an age of national security, he wants somebody who has strong foreign policy credentials, someone who's not necessarily going to be sort of tapping him on his shoulder, wanting his job. He's sort of ruling out public office, but you've a lot of Edwards fans out there. O'BRIEN: But Gephardt was running for president. WALLACE: He was, but he sort of said that that's it. But then there is Governor Vilsack of Iowa is a sort of strong contender. The sense is that John Kerry likes his story. But it's such a funny guessing game. We have no clue.

HEMMER: From the state of Virginia now. A campaign to prevent statutory rape and teen pregnancy is taking an eye-catching strategy. The message from state health officials delivered on billboards: ""Isn't she a little young? Sex with a minor, don't go there."" The same message will appear on post cards and napkins and coasters in hundreds of bars and restaurants and retail stores, as well. Robert Franklin from the Virginia Department of Health is live in Richmond this morning. Good morning to you, sir, and thank you for your time. ROBERT FRANKLIN, VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH: Good morning. Thank you. HEMMER: Why do you believe this campaign is necessary? FRANKLIN: I think it's an issue that's going on, particularly once I've put it out, I've been hearing so many people call me, wanting information, wanting resources. There's figures showing that there are youth who are having children. Youth who are minors who are becoming impregnated by adult men. And I think it's something we need to talk about more and start challenging men to become a part of the solution for this issue. HEMMER: Is it more of an issue, though, in the state of Virginia than elsewhere in this country? FRANKLIN: I don't think it's more of an issue in Virginia. I think we might have taken a different approach to handling this. States that receive temporary assistance to needy families need to do some kind of program or something that addresses statutory rape under this. It's under teen pregnancy prevention. And this is just the way I think we decided to address that, targeting men, looking at men as part of the solution in terms of challenging their peers and changing the social norm that kind of says it's OK, I think, in some communities. HEMMER: I mentioned the billboards being eye catching, and certainly they are. FRANKLIN: Right. HEMMER: What kind of reaction have you gotten? FRANKLIN: I've gotten a lot.

Even Jerusalem, which was the key obstacle to an agreement, they've made some progress on the question of Jerusalem but not enough. Right now, clearly the negotiations are in a different phase. I think they're very serious negotiations because they are facing deadlines. They realize that a failure of their courts is going to result in violence, and I think that both sides have every interest in having an agreement and not failing. Clearly, they both have to posture. They both have to bring pressure to bear. They both have to convey to the other that they're prepared for failure and they can live with it and the other is going to have to pay the price. That's all part of the negotiation process, and it's part of laying the ground for the pressure that comes when the parties have to make the tough decisions, especially those on the issue of Jerusalem. HALL: Well you talk about compromise and posturing, the Palestinian Cabinet said Sunday that Israel cannot hope for peace without withdrawing from Jerusalem and all Arab lands. Is that rhetoric? No, this is a very serious issue for that side, and I don't know that there's going to be a compromise that's going to be easy to come by. TELHAMI: No, there's non question about it. Jerusalem is a very tough issue. I think Jerusalem is two issues, really. One is a political issue, and then the religious issue. The political issue, Mr. Barak finds himself having told the Israeli public for many, many years -- not just he, every Israeli government -- telling the Israeli public that all of Jerusalem, including that part that Israel occupied in '67, is the eternal capital of Israel. There will be no compromise on it. Now they're facing a compromise on it. The Palestinians have felt very strongly that East Jerusalem is part of Palestine, that there certainly are Arab neighborhoods, there are 230,000 Palestinians living there. Israel occupied that in '67. So it's a political issue. But then there is also the religious aspect, which is very emotional. The most holy places to both the Jews, Muslims and Christians are there. The third holiest site for Islam is there and on the Temple Mound, certainly the Jewish religious places, and both sides having a very tough time separating the religious from the sovereignty issue. There is no problem in solving the technical issues in terms of who has access, and they've had -- made progress on that at Camp David. The real question boils down to who has political sovereignty over these places? And right now they're trying to be innovative, but certainly there are lots of obstacles in the way.

How much data, what kind of data it has on its users, is Facebook offering more clarity on its data collection practices? BURKE: one of the more pertinent questions that Mark Zuckerberg was asked by members of Congress was, does Facebook follow you when you're not logged into Facebook. And his answer was yes. Now, Facebook is trying to clarify what exactly that means. So they shared a blog post -- if we can just put on the screen to explain some of the ways Facebook said that they are following you when you're not on Facebook. One is pretty obvious that they get data from other companies that send it to them, but a lot of folks didn't know that if you click share or like on a different site, even if you're not a member of Facebook, no Facebook account, they're tracking information. Another is that Facebook login system, let's say you use Spotify, but you don't have your own username, you use your Facebook account to login to that app, or any other app, then Facebook can track you through those apps. And lastly, they didn't mention this one, Kristie, but I know having interviewed a Facebook advertising executive that Facebook can track you when you're offline, when you're not connected to the internet. How? They have these tie-ups with loyalty cards for example. So let's say you are at the supermarket, and you buy a chocolate bar, that's registered on your loyalty card, that is shared to a third-party, that third-party tells Facebook. So maybe the ads that Kristie Lu Stout sees on her Facebook page are changing based on the chocolate bar that you bought, or maybe the vegetables, or whatever you might be buying, whether that is at a supermarket, or even at a drugstore.

That's a big problem. That's historically unique. Going into the convention, as you talk about, the two big moments he has right now, his party -- the divisions in the party show that a lot of prominent Republicans don't want speaking roles. That's also historically unique. And so, if you look at the polls recently, you know, he was going up. And then the month of June was a really tough month for him. The internals of some of those polls, it was Republicans having second thoughts about Trump. He was just on the cusp of -- after he wrapped up the nomination of uniting the party, of getting some of those skeptical based Republicans around him. That slipped away a little bit just as Hillary Clinton has started to unite some of the Bernie Sanders fans. KEILAR: It doesn't help that he's had another controversial bump in the road really over the weekend. This time, it was a tweet aimed at Hillary Clinton. The original is on the left there you go. So, very clearly, it has this six-pointed star like a Star of David, which initially originated on a message board that was rife with a lot of anti-Semitic language. And here is calling here the most corrupt candidate ever. So, under fire because a lot of people were upset about this star, feeling it was anti-Semitic, he did change it to a circle instead. Today, after a couple of days of all of his surrogates saying, this is not a Star of David. He defended himself saying as much. ""Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a sheriff star or plain star."" It's not a plain star. I mean, any child who draws a star knows that there is five points. Any child that gets a sticker that says you are doing a good job, it has five points. Is this something that's even going to hurt him, though?

So, I do think that until we understand, what is the process inside the Trump campaign that an image like this from this kind of website that has neo-Nazi rants on it and what have you, how that filters into the Trump campaign digital communications operation and gets distributed to his millions and millions of followers, we need to understand how that happens?

And believe me, John, I haven't had a lot of sleep the last two nights. And I've been doing a lot of soul searching. I'm sick over this.

He learned that lesson from President Bush from our problems in Iraq and to a lesser extent in Afghanistan. But this war against terrorism, Chris, is going to continue most military experts believe for the next 10 to 15 years. And so, you have to have the capacity and the toughness to prosecute that war in the Horn of Africa and in the Middle East and West Africa. Local forces have to do most of the fighting as they are in places like Afghanistan or Mali, or Mauritania, but we have to be there.

When you look at interrogation, there's a philosophical difference there, that President Obama believes it's illegal and ineffective. Trump said he did not. He thought he should do even more than what was being done before. And then, of course, there's a language difference on Islam. President Obama believes that you don't say it because you're giving the terrorists what they want as a legitimacy of co-opting their own election and President-elect Trump says that is weakness in action. What's your take? SCHLAPP: You know, I think we should call the enemy by its accurate description and that this is a war with radicalized Islamists. And to say anything other kind of demonstrate, certainly to the American electorate, but I think to those moderate Muslims who are fighting these radicalized elements that we somehow don't get it. And I think we should get -- CUOMO: Hold on, Matt, I think we both know moderate Muslims do not like you using the term anything attached to Islam because they say it's not Islam. Don't take people who are perverting and bastardizing my faith and give them ownership of it. They don't like it. Just to correct that. SCHLAPP: I understand the theological conversation. But I think they also understand that America needs to understand that there is a radicalized element that they're dealing with in their own communities and in their own homes and in their own countries. They are the ones who are persecuted, much more even than Americans are. And we have to connect to them. So, I don't want to be disrespectful of",0.2324987510652678,2016-12-07
1845209,2161287,CNN,The Situation Room,"president does show up and answer questions before the special counsel. What do you make of that strategy? SHAWN TURNER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Wolf, I think from a legal perspective we can all understand why his lawyers might want to protect the president and limit the scope of the questioning. But -- but with regard to kind of the investigation overall, we know that any efforts to limit questioning or any efforts to not explore all avenues with regard to this investigation are going to be looked at as if the president has something to hide. So from that perspective, I don't think it's a good strategy. And it's also the case that if they want to try to leverage the president in that interview with the president, you can't do that and also say at the same time that you're going to limit the scope of questioning. Bob Mueller just has too much leverage. BLITZER: Yes, Rebecca, it was interesting. Sam Nunberg was, at least briefly, a campaign aide to the president. During the campaign he spent five hours before a federal grand jury today here in Washington. All of us remember earlier in the week he said repeatedly in multiple television interviews that wasn't going to happen. REBECCA BERG, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. So I have whiplash from that 180, Wolf. It was quite a week for Sam Nunberg. But really, he wasn't going to have a choice in this matter. When you're subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, you can't just say, ""I'll take a pass,"" or you will be arrested and forced to comply. So Sam Nunberg did what he had to do. We'll have to wait and see what his testimony yields in terms of any potential indictments or important information for this investigation. BLITZER: Yes, go ahead, Ron. BROWNSTEIN: I'd say, obviously, the president of the United States is in a different position. But the -- kind of the arc of this story this week is a reminder of where the leverage in these relationships really lies. And the idea that you're going to tell the special counsel, as Sam Nunberg, ""Well, I'm going to do this. I'm not going to do that,"" it really -- you know, there are other people on the panel who can say better than I, it really doesn't work that way. BERG: Yes. BLITZER: Yes, and the question, Sam, is does the president really have a lot of leverage? If Robert Mueller and his team want him to answer questions, is he going to be over to say, no? VINOGRAD: I don't think so. And I think that, to Ron's point, and Shawn, to your point, Mueller is going to get this investigation done, whether Nunberg decides to comply or other witnesses decide to comply. He has other ways of getting this investigation. And while the House investigation is being hurried along on the GOP side, we've heard that the Republicans want to end this",0.2967482031068861,2018-03-09

But it's worth coming back to the point that in order to make these decisions, communities need know how many cases they have. And with that adequate testing capacity, they can make those decisions as well. TAPPER: A really good idea, maybe not necessarily cancelling school but cancelling grandparents' day. That's what happened at my kid's school. They still have school, but they canceled grandparents' day because you don't want the most vulnerable people, not the kids, but the grandparents, to be affected. GUPTA: Yes. I mean, that we do know. We do know who the most vulnerable people are, and they are the elderly. So everything and anyone can possibly be spreading the virus to them. I think the school thing is going to be really interesting, and, obviously, Dr. Murthy and I have been talking about this, but most of the modeling as to why schools should be closed and the benefit of doing so is based on the flu. And this is a different virus. TAPPER: Well the flu -- there's a higher mortality rate for the flu with kids than the coronavirus with kids. GUPTA: That's right. BASH: But is it accurate that maybe, as you said, that there's not a high mortality rate among children, but they can carry it? GUPTA: They can carry it. There's not a high mortality rate and they can carry it. But their carrying it seems to be a smaller driver of spread. It can happen. But to sort of base these large policies on that idea, you know, we'll have to see. I mean, this is a novel coronavirus, so we have to learn this as we go along. But it's a big decision to close these massive schools and colleges, and I'm not sure that we have proven the reward of that yet versus the risk. TAPPER: Sanjay, what should be we be calling this? I mean, it's been called everything from the Wuhan virus to coronavirus. Coronavirus, as you know better that I, is more of a wide spread term. GUPTA: A family of viruses. TAPPER: Yes. MERS was a coronavirus. People call it a novel coronavirus. Should we just be calling this COVID-19? GUPTA: Perhaps. We made a decision to call it novel coronavirus here because that's what we started calling. COVID-19, we felt, was a little too clinical and people sort of understood that, but the novel in front of it is definitely important. TAPPER: All right. Thanks so much.

1651666,1967062,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): We asked the Garridos to sit down for a conversation about Fidel Castro and Cuba to capture how Cuban American families have evolved more than 50 years after Castro rose to power. When Jorge Garrido came to the United States in 1960 at age 19, he had hopes back then of crushing Fidel Castro's dictatorship. JORGE GARRIDO, CUBAN AMERICAN: I was adamant at that time. Now, you know, I guess everybody's tired. LAVANDERA: Everybody's tired? JORGE GARRIDO: Everyone is tired because nothing has been done. Or we lost a lot of opportunities. LAVANDERA (voice-over): Jorge and his wife, Lourdes, have now lived in the United States longer than they ever lived in Cuba. Fidel Castro is a figure that forever changed their lives. LOURDES GARRIDO, CUBAN AMERICAN: What can I tell you about Fidel? I mean, like you said, Fidel is Fidel. He's a non-issue at this point. And I don't think Cuba will ever change. When Fidel goes, the regimen will be the same with the (INAUDIBLE) people, younger people. Maybe I'm wrong. I wish I am. LAVANDERA: Are you as angry today toward him that you were 40, 50 years ago? LOURDES GARRIDO: I mean, you know, life makes you change, like the way you think. When I came here, I was too young. But he destroyed our lives, you know? Most of my life has been here, not in my country. So, in that sense, it has affected me a lot because I missed all the good things about Cuba. LAVANDERA (voice-over): But the American-born children of Cuban exiles like Alexa and Maite view Cuba differently. MAITE GARRIDO, CUBAN AMERICAN: I feel Cuban but it's an abstract for me. It's a culture, it's a tradition, it's family. It's what you do. For them, it's more raw. For me, it's -- I don't like Castro. I would love to see a democracy there and I think most Americans probably would. But what they feel is obviously going to be much greater. LOURDES GARRIDO: Yes, because we had to live through the Bay of Pigs invasion, where we both lost -- yes, a lot of friends, you know, close friends. I remember clearly the October crisis of the missiles. LAVANDERA (voice-over): The talk turned toward what could have been done differently in the last 50 years to bring political change to Cuba. It's not something the younger generation thinks of as much. Time has softened Cuban American support of the trade embargo but Jorge and Lourdes are still adamant that Castro's regime must go. JORGE GARRIDO: The dinosaurs, if you want to call it, the cronies that are in power right now, they don't want to let go. And they should have let go a long time ago if they were really true patriots. Yes, I'm very angry at that because we had a beautiful country.

But interestingly enough, a lot of shares changed hands today. Volume was very high, and I think for those who were trading, I think they were kind of shaking off the cobwebs of the debt ceiling dysfunction and thinking now what? So now what they're doing is they're focusing on third quarter earnings, which didn't impress much today, with McDonald's falling short, Halliburton falling short. However, the S&P; 500 eked out an itsy-bitsy little gain today, and guess what? It hit a new record high, a record high where the percentage doesn't even register on the percentage scale, but still, nonetheless, the S&P; 500 at a third record high in a row. Richard?

Furthermore, I know that these mRNA vaccines have the capacity to use and to engineer the mRNA so it would be more potent against these strains. And that work is actually already ongoing. So it may just lend us to feel like we need a booster effect further down the road, so all of that science is ongoing in anticipation. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAMEROTA: That sounds familiar. I believe you just said something like that. But, practically speaking, Dr. Hotez, how does it work? Because I would take that 60 percent right now, okay, and I think that so many Americans would. So that means that then when the booster is available, we would go back for the booster next year or whenever you have it ready? HOTEZ: Yes, that's probably some scenario like that. But, look, here is where we have to -- here's how we have to proceed, I think. If we can vaccinate the American people, fully vaccinated, 240 million people in terms of three quarters of the U.S. population to slow or halt virus transmission, which is our estimate of what's required, if we can do that over the next five to six months, we still have the possibility of completely getting ahead of this variant and really halting virus transmission in this country. We're not going to do it just with the mRNA vaccines alone. We won't have enough of those vaccines. It's still a young technology in terms of robust production, so maximize the use of the two mRNA vaccines. But if we can, if we can get the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine up, the adenovirus vaccine, the J&J adenovirus vaccine, if we can get that Novavax vaccine into production, we have a recombinant protein vaccine that nobody in the federal government has talked to us about bringing into the U.S., if we can bring all of those vaccines to bear, we can actually have a pretty big impact on halting virus transmission. And I think that's where the emphasis needs to be right now is bringing along those other vaccines as soon as possible. BERMAN: If, right, if, and that's a goal, but that's a goal that's not days and weeks away, that's a goal largely months away. And then there's a question about what do we do in the meantime, particularly, if this variant first seen in South Africa is here in the U.S. spreading amongst the community and maybe soon spreading quickly. So, how far are you willing to go, Doctor? What measures do you think need to be considered now to make sure that the South African variant doesn't take off? HOTEZ: Well, first of all, I do think we can maximize vaccination. I think we're -- you know, generally, the tone that I'm hearing is",0.0425001616195199,2021-01-29

Thank you, ma'am. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) PAUL: So, for the first time in the investigation into the January 6th riot, the Department of Justice is unveiling seditious conspiracy charges. Eleven defendants have been charged including the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, who pleaded not guilty in court yesterday. SANCHEZ: Now, prosecutors say Rhodes and others used encrypted communications to coordinate their plans leading up to January 6. CNN's Paula Reid has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, made an initial appearance in court today in Texas as one of the first people charged with seditious conspiracy related to the U.S. Capitol attack. JONATHON MOSELEY, ATTORNEY FOR OATH KEEPERS LEADER STEWART RHODES: Even the government says that they're accusing him of an organizational role, they admit that they did not commit any violence. They did not hurt any police officers. They did not damage any property. But they're charging him as being conspirators, the organizers or aiders and abettors, that sort of thing. REID: But a detailed indictment placed out a sprawling, methodical plot to disrupt the counting of 2020 electoral votes starting in the days after the election when Rhodes allegedly told his supporters, we aren't getting through this without a civil war. Prosecutors allege Rhodes and his ten co-defendants traveled from across the country to D.C. with stockpiled weapons, ammunition and other tactical equipment. Video from January 6 captures Oath Keepers wearing military gear forcing their way into the building in a military stack formation. Prosecutors say the group even stationed quick reaction forces outside D.C. to rush into the Capitol if needed, and that Rhodes was planning for violence well beyond January 6. Rhodes' estranged wife also spoke to CNN. TASHA ADAMS, ESTRANGED WIFE OF STEWART RHODES: He sees himself as a great leader, he almost has his own mythology of himself, and I think he almost made it come true, seeing himself as some sort of figure in history. REID: Meanwhile, some Trump allies like Senate Minority leader Kevin McCarthy are refusing to voluntarily cooperate with the House Select Committee investigating January 6. Even though, McCarthy previously supported an investigation and said that President Trump admitted responsibility for the attack. CNN surfacing this interview from shortly after the riot. REP.

KRIEL: All right, thank you so much. Our Jomana Karadsheh live for us from Amman, Jordan. We want to take a look at how this may impact Qatar's big long-term ambitions. For that, let's cross over to London where lecturer David Roberts is standing by for us. He also wrote Qatar, Securing the Global Ambitions of a City-State. David, the list of demands is extensive. The time limit for Qatar to comply is extremely short. In your opinion, are these negotiations destined for success? DAVID ROBERTS, LECTURER: I wouldn't have thought that this initial iteration of negotiations would be successful at all. I think that the Emiratis and the Saudis have set up the negotiations at the moment, such as they are, for this initial stage to fail. I say this in terms of the demands that they have put across, the 10, 12, 13 demands. Some are of them are extremely onerous. I don't really think they expected Qatar to accede at the moment. I suppose this is a much larger piece and a larger piece of negotiation. And we'll have to wait and see what the next stage brings. KRIEL: David, what do you believe are the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia's real objectives here with this list of demands? ROBERTS: There's been lots of issues with Qatar, of course, as we know relatively close relations with Iran for a long period of time. We shouldn't overdo this. I mean, Qatar working relations with Iran, not much more. Al Jazeera, as we know, has been a thorn of contention for 25 years or more. And also I think it's a bit more about a fundamental approach to foreign policy. Qatar and Turkey, for example, when they engage in the Arab Spring and elsewhere, they are eager. They think it's a good idea to support groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, political Islam more generally. They think that is a sensible modis operandi. In contrast, the UAE, for example, and also Saudi Arabia, they fundamentally disagree. They don't want to see those kinds of actors empowered in any way shape or form. So, there is really quite a basic fundamental approach, which is really quite different. They're completely antithetical, in fact. KRIEL: Just how significant, speaking of Turkey, is the demand that Turkey halt the development of its military base in Qatar?

And we begin with Mosul where Iraqi-led forces are on the doorstep of a city held by ISIS for more than two years. Iraqi troops now in control of the neighboring forces are in control of Gogjali (ph), which they've sealed off from the terror group. The military says they've also raised a flag on a state TV building in the area. Now, Mosul residents reached by phone have reported heavy shelling as Iraqi troops move in. Meantime, reports obtained by the UN say ISIS tried to force 25,000 people from their homes, planning to possibly use them as human shields, but coalition flights disrupted that plan. Let's get you straight to Michael Holmes who is in Irbil east of Mosul. Michael, what happens next? MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, well, I guess next is Mosul. But when? That is the question. Iraqi forces came at the eastern side of Mosul from three different directions over the last day or so. The most significant battle that place, Gogjali (ph) that you mentioned, the last major population cetner before Mosul proper. There was fierce resistance there. ISIS snipers and an awful lot apparently of land mines, IEDs and the like. They also had big boulders placed across the roads. Iraqi counterterrorism forces surrounded the place and they are now going through and clearing it and perhaps a portent of things to come in Mosul proper. There are 25,000 civilians in Gogjali (ph). So, they're having to work around them as well. And once they cleared the dangers inside that city, they're then going to have screen all of those people, because one of the risks, of course, is ISIS fighters blending in. With the local population. When Mosul? Well, probably a day or so of consolidation before then, but they are literally at the doorstep, Becky. ANDERSON: You've had a chance, I know, to talk to people who are beginning to come to terms with their life after ISIS, those lucky enough to have been liberated, what have they been telling you?

We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight, North Korea's warning that nuclear war could break out at any moment just hours after Kim Jong-un paraded his military arsenal and presided over a failed, but still provocative missile test. The regime's next move could be a nuclear test, as the defiant dictator appear unfazed by new warnings from the Trump administration. Vice President Mike Pence personally delivering a message to North Korea, staring down Kim's troops at the country's heavily-armed border. Pence says the United States' strategic patience is now over and its military options are wide open. Here in Washington, President Trump took time out from the White House Easter celebration to tell CNN that North Korea must behave. After the president ordered warships to the region, Press Secretary Sean Spicer says he doesn't expect Mr. Trump to draw any clear red lines telegraphing how he will respond to Kim Jong-un's threats. We're also following breaking news in a nationwide manhunt for the suspected Facebook killer. Police in Ohio just issued a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Steve Stephens. He is accused of killing an elderly man apparently chosen at random, then posting a video of it on Facebook. Police believe he is armed, he's angry, and he's on the loose right now.

That's according to market research firm Yankee Group, which expects that number to double by 2010. A handful of tech companies are ready to cash in with newly created phones specifically for the tween set. This week our friends over at ""Consumer Reports"" reviewed the first two models to hit the market. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOAN MURATORE, ""CONSUMER REPORTS:"" This is the Firefly mobile phone for kids. If you noticed, it has no keypad. So the parents have to enter numbers using a menu, similar to what you would use to enter a text message on a normal phone. You can see it's got some preprogrammed buttons. It's got a mom button and a dad button. This is a 911 button on the side. This is the phone book button, where the child can scroll through the pre- entered numbers that the parent has put in and make calls to those people. This is a prepaid phone where you buy a card. You can load minutes onto the phone. This way the child can't run up a huge bill and it is also a safety thing so the parent can control whose contacting their child. It worked fairly smoothly. The voice quality is OK. It is not high tech in the since that it has other features, like text messages or picture taking or anything like that. So it's really an average cell phone. This is also a parental-controlled phone. It's called the leapfrog tick tock similar to the other phones that we tested for kids. The parent can enter numbers. And the child is limited to making and receiving calls to those numbers. Leapfrog is an educational toy company and it's got some games on here, such as spelling games, math games, where the child can earn extra reward minutes to make calls or receive calls. We had some problems getting this phone activated. I think it's a fairly new phone on the market from Leapfrog. And we're actually retesting this one right now. We bought another sample and reporting on that shortly. The minutes for these phones are about 25 cents per minute, which I think is kind of expensive in terms of prepaid phones. Regular prepaid cell phones. And also the minutes expire after a certain period. Really the only reason to buy one of these would be if you wanted to limit. You want to use the parental control feature. If you want to limit who the child can call and who can call them, the safety issue, or if your are looking at it as a cost issue.

We had a lot of reasonable doubt there. They didn`t show us the -- didn`t show us the evidence that, you know, was good enough for a conviction.

I mean, they had hair in the trunk that matched Caylee. This is -- REICHS: Maybe. BEHAR: Well, maybe? REICHS: Maybe, it was similar to, but they couldn`t say it was Caylee`s hair definitely. And Caylee would have been in that car. It could have been there by any member of legitimate reasons. BEHAR: From what I`ve read -- maybe I`m wrong here -- the hair was of a dead person. REICHS: No. That`s hair-banding, and that`s a very, very controversial type of evidence of -- coming from a dead person. BEHAR: I see. REICHS: Experiments have been done that show you also find hair banding in hair that has not come from a dead person. BEHAR: What about the smell of the -- the death smell in the trunk? No good? REICHS: I think again that`s really marginal science. It`s not science, the Arpad Vass testimony -- that is science that`s not been tested enough for replicability and reliability in order to submit it in court. BEHAR: I see. So none of this was sufficient to convict? REICHS: I don`t think so. I think like a scientist because I am a scientist. And to me the physical evidence just wasn`t there. There was nothing there that was tying her to the death of this child. There was no cause of death. No time of death. No place of death. BEHAR: Yes. REICHS: I`m addressing the American Bar Association in about a month on the topic of the ""CSI"" effect. And we`ve all heard of that. The fact that juries today, do they demand more stringent forensic evidence? Perhaps that`s what was happening in this case. BEHAR: Why is that? Somebody was saying to me today that it -- it`s ""CSI`s"" fault because you know, these shows -- maybe your series also, makes it clear to people they have to have that forensic evidence on every case or they`re never going to convict ever again.

2389949,2711052,CNN,First Move With Julia Chatterley,"things are driving prices, Julia. The most recent thing, of course, is the announcement of Bitcoin future ETFs. That's a big thing. It's not big enough, but it's a major regulatory development that signals some path forward for the industry. Also, the global economy looks very fragile. We could be recovering, but we could be facing high inflation. Bitcoin responds to that. CHATTERLEY: And tied to this, and I'm sort of surprised a little bit that the market is not more concerned is some of the contours and the details of what's in the U.S. infrastructure deal that was just signed. Brian, how should we be taking some of the rules -- regulations, let's call them that that is contained within that agreement? BROOKS: Well, the agreement says as much about the state of American democracy as it says about equity, Julia, and I'll tell you what I mean, by that. I mean, many of your viewers will know, the bill has a provision, which requires not just traditional exchanges, but software developers, decentralized finance protocols, all kinds of other things to report tax, you know, gains from people who participate in those protocols. And yet the whole point of crypto is to allow for peer to peer transactions without an intermediary. So what the bill basically says is kind of like if you asked a newspaper for a report on the taxation of transactions between its readers and the classified ad pages. I mean, the newspaper doesn't, people are transacting with each other. Right? And there are criminal penalties behind that. So, that's a little bit crazy. But the reason there's some hope is we know that a majority of House members and a majority of senators actually oppose that language. We know that because a few months ago when the bill was being debated, 55 senators in the Senate side and a number of House Democrats on the on the House side, oppose this language. So we expect it will eventually get cleaned up, it's just a weird feature of American democracy that the majority doesn't always win. CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean it does feel like -- and you can give me your sense of this more that we're looking at a future of finance that under Democrats rule here is far more controlled government oversight, to your point, and I think your analogy there with a newspapers is a brilliant one, versus the image of what I think the crypto community and particularly for the underlying technology sees, which is a far more hands off, decentralized, swifter, more efficient version of finance, and the banks, I guess, lie somewhere in the middle. Are we headed off in that direction? Because I see huge challenges coming if particularly under this government, they are trying to head in one direction and the crypto community is clearly heading in a different direction -- diametrically opposed option actually.

BASH: At this very moment, all 100 senators are filing into the old Senate chamber.

What we are going to see is you see Senator Leahy there. He's the chairman -- incoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Of course, Hillary Clinton arriving right now. That is a very interesting room, the old Senate chamber. It literally is the place where the Senate used to deliberate back in the 1800s. In fact, in that room where the senators are going to meet before they officially convene later today, that's the place where people like Daniel Webster and Henry Clay debated very heady issues that really made a big difference historically in our time, like slavery and expanding the territories. That is the kind of history that is going to be surrounding these senators this morning a they file into that room. It's been a little bit controversial, Heidi, because there are going to be no cameras in that room. All 100 senators are going to be there, but it's not officially an on the record, in session meeting. And some people -- there has been some editorials saying wait a minute, if you're going to meet all 100 senators, well, do it out in the open. But, again, Harry Reid and others thought that this was the kind of thing that they needed in order to be behind closed doors without the cameras, without anybody being able to look in and to be able to really discuss with one another how they are going to try to move forward, they hope, at least at the beginning, they say, in some kind of bipartisan fashion, or at least set that kind of tone at the start.

534641,774342,CNN,Glenn Beck,"morning in New Hampshire. It`s a politics and eggs breakfast, and he was disastrous. He was rambling, meandering. He wasn`t glad-handing people. He wasn`t focused. And I think this is a man who`s behind the curve, in terms of a presidential race. BECK: Toby, I will -- and I`m not fishing for a compliment. In fact, I`d rather you didn`t make this about me here, but you put me at 18. I swear to you, when I saw that Bill O`Reilly was like at number 82, I was like, ""No chance of being on that list."" Sean Hannity is in the forties. It makes absolutely no sense to me. Why? Why? Why are those guys so far down? HARNDEN: Well, that`s very modest of you, Glenn. BECK: No, it`s not. I see the ratings. HARNDEN: Well, I think you can certainly make a case with a lot of our choices certain people should have been higher, and certainly I think maybe Sean Hannity, yes, you could make a very powerful argument that he should have been a little bit higher. But we tried to take a step back and look at influence, and influence, not just within the conservative movement, but within the broader populace. And we felt that you, with the show on CNN Headline News, you know, there`s an item on the Drudge Report, Matt Drudge was number three on our list, yesterday saying that you might have a big deal in the offing, we thought that you and some of the other people who were higher up on our list that maybe didn`t quite have the ratings were like an investment for the future, somebody who is going to -- you know, whose audience is going to grow and whose influence is going to grow. And the future was very key in our decisions. We weren`t just looking at the past records; we were looking at potential for the future. BECK: America, see this guy over here? Make sure you don`t take that bet in U.S. dollars. Make sure you get it in euros or pounds. I noticed on the liberal list you have Bill, Al Gore, then the third most influential is an adviser to Hillary, and then Hillary. To me, that says two things, one, the concentration of power of the Clintons. And the second thing is she`s last in the list. She`s the one running for president. HARNDEN: Yes. Well, obviously, we thought very, you know, carefully about that. And we decided, really, that I think there`s an increasingly strong element of the Hillary Clinton campaign which is all about a Bill Clinton restoration. I`m sure that that is how Bill Clinton sees it. I think that`s a kind of a duality there which is going to be increasingly problematic for Hillary, could be her Achilles heel. And we looked at Mark Penn... BECK: Toby, I`m sorry. I`ve only got 30 seconds, and I want to ask you this. What is the most controversial",0.5825863838522066,2007-11-05

I do think that we're seeing a sort of scaling back on the kind of so- called bromance between President Trump and President Putin. There's a very real sense that the Russians understand those restrictions aren't going to be lifted anytime soon. I think the more pressing and interesting case is looking at Europe and how the Europeans are viewing this. They're seeing this playing out on their television screens and they're just wondering and waiting, when is the Trump administration going to turn around and publicly chastise Russia or the very least, distance themselves from Russia and reaffirm their commitment to us, because the kind of rhetoric that they're hearing and feeling coming from the U.S. is full of mixed messages. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson saying he won't attend that NATO summit in April, he'll be visiting Moscow instead. The optics of that are confusing to say the least. BLITZER: And the president, Rebecca, he's been silent last night when he was in Louisville, he did some local TV interviews. Reporters were told he's not going to talk about any of this, don't even ask any questions. And today, the White House was pretty silent on it as well. What do you make of that? BERG: Right. Well, its' not really clear if they have suddenly found some discipline here on this issue and some message discipline or maybe there are some concerns from a legal perspective with an ongoing FBI investigation, with ongoing investigations on the Hill. Do they not want to get themselves in potentially more legal trouble than they are already in? It's not clear. And, really, this will only last as has been the case in the past until perhaps there is another Trump tweet or another Trump interview. It's really unclear if this is a long-term strategy or if this is just right now. BORGER: Well, what's he going to do, tweet about his own FBI director? You know, can he say -- I mean, you're laughing, Phil, but what's he going to say? ""Sad""? I mean, I just don't -- what can he say about Comey and also wouldn't he have to say something about Barack Obama and the charge he leveled against Barack Obama? And so, you know, I think maybe Trump on his own without the advice of his staff may know that this is something he needs to keep mum about because, is he going to challenge Comey? If he challenges him, maybe he'd want to fire him. BERG: He's done that with intelligence and -- MUDD: But keeping mum is not a good option. If you're sitting in Europe and you've complained to the White House, Obama and the current president, about interventions in your own election, the Europeans as you're suggesting have to be looking at the Americans to say, when are you going to lead the charge to oppose the Russians?

Cops are saying that the dad, Adam Baker, asked police to notify the Australian consulate in Atlanta about his arrest. He`s originally Australian. Is he trying to turn this into some kind of international incident? What do you think of all these latest developments in this horrific story about a disabled child in peril? Call me: 1-877-JVM-SAYS, 1-877-586- 7297. Straight out to Tara Servatius, host of ""The Tara Servatius Show"" on WBT Radio out of Charlotte, North Carolina. Tara, what is the very latest? TARA SERVATIUS, RADIO SHOW HOST: Well, Jane, you wrapped it up. Adam Baker has now been arrested. Here`s the thing, Jane. These aren`t new charges. This isn`t from yesterday. I told you in the beginning our sources were telling us they would leave Adam Baker out of jail while he was still useful to them. And when he was no longer useful, he`d be heading to jail. And that`s where he`s going. They didn`t find what they need at the landfill. And now you`re seeing Elisa Baker being paraded around. She`s at a new site they`re searching. They`ve got promising leads. It looks to me like they`re done with Adam Baker. They`ve put him in the jail. And now, heck, playing them against each other? Now it`s Elisa Baker that they`re driving around? VELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes. And I have to wonder if they also thought this dad might have been a flight risk. If they`re on the verge of a break in this case and they figure, ""We`ve got to have him locked up behind bars because he could disappear,"" Mike Brooks? MIKE BROOKS, HLN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: No. I guarantee that they had him, as we say, in pocket the whole time, Jane, finding out who he talked to, where with he was going, who he was seeing. No, they had it the whole time he was out. But the bottom line is, they had paper on him all along. Very similar type charges that they`re holding her on. He`s not cooperating with police anymore. Why not lock him up, try to put a little bit of pressure on him, if any, and find out if he talks? And who is coming forward possibly to make the best deal? Who knows what the real information is? And why do they have her out there? Where did the information originally come about this site from where she lived three years ago? Was it from her? Is she out there to say, ""Well, this used to be here. That used to be there""? And who knows what else she might know? VELEZ-MITCHELL: And I think it`s interesting they`re searching an area where she lived three years ago. They just moved to the new family home from which the child disappeared just over a month ago. So they don`t know that area as well if they wanted to hide something. They would go back to an area that they knew a lot",0.4520897214822965,2010-10-25

PAUL: And, Rebecca, is there any indication, any idea as to what Senate will look like if Roy Moore, if he wins? How do they move forward? How do they work together? How do they pass legislation? BERG: That's a really great question. You've already had all of these Republicans come out and say that they don't support him, that this is a disqualifying allegation. If it's true, and even Republicans who say that they don't care about his defense, that they believe these accusers, it would be an awkward situation to say the least. He wouldn't -- he would come into this Congress not feeling as though he owes Republicans anything.

(END VIDEO CLIP) GREENFIELD: Probably the key reason why, even with economic pessimism, Republicans actually gained two seats in the Senate and six in the House. But that was before the invasion of Iraq. (GUNFIRE) GREENFIELD: As this fall campaign begins, Republicans appear to be facing a stiff political wind. Polls suggest they have lost much or all of their advantages on Iraq and broader issues of combating terror. So, it's not surprising that, the week before the Labor Day kickoff, the president, the vice president, and the secretary of defense have all tried to reframe the debate, with Cheney and Rumsfeld charging that Democrats do not understand the conflict and will leave America weaker. (on camera): Four years ago, Democrats tried to finesse the national security issue and run on domestic concerns. That didn't work.

Anderson, back to you. COOPER: Thelma Gutierrez, thanks very much. Covering the case for us tonight, Court TV's Lisa Bloom. Lisa, good to see you here. LISA BLOOM, ANCHOR, COURT TV: Hi. COOPER: It's a difficult case. The tomorrow apparently, the defense is going to actually show the videotape in the courtroom for the first time to the alleged victim. BLOOM: Right. COOPER: How powerful is that going to be for the jury? BLOOM: You know, it's going to be very powerful. And what's striking is that apparently she has never seen it before, Anderson, which I just can't understand why the prosecutors have not sat down with her... COOPER: You think they should have shown it to her... BLOOM: ... and gone over it... COOPER: ... in advance? BLOOM: Yes, and that's the normal course of this type of thing, if there is a normal course for having a videotape of a gang rape. But having some kind of evidence to show the prosecution complaining witness, ordinarily she'd see that in advance... COOPER: How important is her reaction... BLOOM: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... COOPER: ... going to be? BLOOM: ... first time in front of the jury. I think it's going to be very important. The defense says that she wanted to be a porn star, that she was pretending to be unconscious. If that's true, I think her reaction in seeing that tape in front of the jury is going to be very significant. COOPER: You know, that's the defense. They've been making a lot of claims. They claim she wanted to be a porn star. But there was testimony before that her boyfriend at the time, her ex-boyfriend, who is one of these people who allegedly raped her, and is one of the three, had priorly, prior to this, videotaped her or attempted to videotape her having sex. She said, No, don't videotape me, stop it. He stopped it then. This was weeks before the actual incident. BLOOM: Right. COOPER: That seems to argue against the idea that she wants to be a porn star. BLOOM: Well, it sure does. But keep in mind, we're only in the prosecution case. We haven't heard from the defense yet. And to add to that, yesterday there was a prosecution expert who testified that she appeared to have GHB, the date-rape drug, in her system, that she was limp and lifeless in the video, in the way that somebody would be if they were drugged and unconscious, not faking unconsciousness. And the expert seemed to feel that her physical reactions were consistent with... COOPER: Because she was still responding... BLOOM: ... the prosecution theory. COOPER: ... to pain. BLOOM: Exactly.

922252,1206013,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"what this debate is all about. Our CNN's Don Lemon, he's joining us with a closer look. Don, you're not going to do auction? DON LEMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I can use them, right, to talk about these numbers? MALVEAUX: You've got to slow it down for us, if you will. LEMON: I've got a question for you though. You and I are about the same age. We've been paying into the system, as they call it, for about the same amount of time. MALVEAUX: That's right. LEMON: And we expect to have that money, right, when we retire, if we get sick? We want that money as many Americans -- most Americans do. But, listen, when you're trying to deal with a huge budget deficit and a budget that is $40 trillion over the next 10 or 11 years, you're going to have to look at that very closely. Here's -- I want to show you why we're talking about entitlements so much, because entitlements make up 40 percent. Forty percent of the budget comes in entitlements. Look right here. Social Security, 20.4 percent of the budget. Medicare comes to 12.8 percent of the budget. And then, Medicaid, of course, 7.28 percent of the budget. And this is a place where changes can really be made, but politicians are afraid to touch it because, how do you go back home and you tell people, hey, that money, that system that you paid into, well, we're not going to be able to afford it? Maybe. But this is why those entitlements make up such a big part of Social Security. It's really because of baby boomers and baby boomers retiring. So, look at this. Right now, 2010, and about now, there are three workers who support every one retiree so that they can get their money. That's right now in 2010. At the height of when baby boomers will retire, in about 2035, you'll have only two workers supporting one retiree. And that's because between now and then, it will go from about 30 million people who are retiring to about 50 million people who are retiring, and they're going to draw from Social Security and then other entitlements. So, let's look at this. When we're talking about that, why don't we take a closer look at Medicare? Here's where -- look at all of this money. So, in 1975, there were 24 million enrollees, 24 million Americans enrolled in Medicare. 2010, just last year, 47 million. That number jumped -- almost doubles -- 47 million. And then, Suzanne, by 2040, 88 million people, Americans, will be enrolled in Medicare. And this is the cost. This is the cost. This is where the real information is. 1975, the government paid about $2,800 for every single person. And so here, you had 24 million in, paying about $2,800 for every person. 2010, about $12,000 the government is paying for every person to be enrolled here.

IMUS: If you read these newspaper articles and you read that phrase, you think, well this guys a racist. Well I`m not a racist and I`m not a bigot. But these young women deserve to know that it was not said with malice. HAMMER: Malice or not, this is not the first time Imus has said something that some saw as racially offensive, like when he once referred to ""New York Times"" sports columnist William Roden (ph) as ""quota hire,"" and PBS anchor Gwenn Aiffel (ph) as a ""cleaning lady."" CNN commentator Roland Martin tells SHOWBIZ TONIGHT sorry just isn`t good enough. MARTIN: I don`t know why he said it. But he has a history of making sexist comments, of making racist comments and folks simply are tired of it. SHARPTON: What is any possible reason you could feel that this kind of statement could be just forgiven and overlooked? IMUS: I don`t think it should be. I don`t think it can be. I think it can be forgiven, but I don`t think it can be overlooked. I`m not a journalist. I`m not Tim Russert. I`m not a politician. I don`t have any -- we don`t have an agenda. Our agenda is to try to be funny. And sometimes we go too far. Sometimes we go way too far. HAMMER: But has Imus now gone so far that his show could be canceled? SHOWBIZ TONIGHT can tell you that is unlikely. It`s a big money-maker on 70 radio stations. The show distributed by CBS, which has condemned Imus` comments, along with MSNBC, which simulcasts the show. MARTIN: I don`t buy that nonsense. They`re making a killing off of the show.

Whether the church has fulfilled any responsibilities to the child or not is separate. But this guy hasn't even seen this kid in years. DONAHUE: No. He's despicable. All right? He's delinquent. And I guess my point is, you know, if the point is that we have a troubled guy here who took advantage of a situation -- but I will not buy the business of the one more victimized woman who didn't know what she was doing. But we do have a lousy situation here. What's the bottom line to be drawn from this? He didn't need to be treated. He was -- he had a natural influence over women. He needed to be counseled and told, ""If you can't abide by your vow of celibacy, get out."" We have imams and we have rabbis and we have ministers who can't abide by their marital vow, and they cheat on their spouse. What are we going to do about that? And I think what's driving this is, is celibacy the question? Let's have an honest discussion about what's really driving it. BLAINE: And let's be clear that Father Willenburg was using his position of power and authority and actually involved with three women at one time that Pat knew about. And the bottom line is that today Nate has spoken out because he cares and wants to help other kids who were fathered by priests. And I think he is to be commended. And we are extremely grateful to Pat. And now more than ever, anyone else who has information about Father Willenburg or any other predator should come forward and report the information you have.

Republicans have problem with nonwhite voters. The percentage of African-Americans without health insurance has been cut in half. BORGER: Exactly. KEILAR: Exactly. And huge gains among Latino Americans, another key constituency for Democrat that Republicans are hoping to cut into. But they gain big time here with their uninsured rate falling by over 12 percent. BLITZER: Very quickly, Loretta Lynch. The nominee to be the next attorney general, what's the status of her confirmation? BORGER: Well, it's all tied up in this piece of legislation that Republicans have said that they want to tie her to. And I think that the American public, it's why they are sick of politicians and I think they don't want to see it tied up in rigmarole. And at some point, it's going to be tight. Joe Biden may have to break a tie. But she'll probably end up getting through. ZELENY: The Democrats may have to give on this as well, though, if they want to see her confirmed.

But over time China did slow down its support for revolutionary movements in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia and Thailand and Burma. And its relations with Vietnam soured for many reasons, but certainly the opening to America was one of them. These shifts finally led to a wholesale rethinking of China's foreign policy. But only seven years after Kissinger's meetings under a new Chinese leader dung Xiaoping who first consolidated power and then broke with Mao's revolutionary world view. On Iran, let's make several caveats. China's move toward the West was fueled by its split with the Soviet Union and perhaps the People's Republic's total isolation. Iran faces no such dire security threat. And as an oil producing country that even on under sanctions gets tens of billions of dollars in revenues, it has never truly been isolated or destitute. And yet Iran clearly resents being treated as a pariah in the world. A new generation of Iranians has demonstrated that frustration in many different ways. And a new set of leaders who have some influence or not complete control wants to restore Iran to a more normal status. Will that mean that Tehran's foreign policies will moderate? Well, history suggests that as countries get more integrated into the world and the global economy they have fewer incentives to be spoilers and more to maintain stability. Of course Iran will follow its national interests and sometimes this will conflict with American policy sharply. But on America's most pressing challenges in the Middle East right now, the threat from ISIS, the stability of Iraq, the stability of Afghanistan, Iran and the United States actually have overlapping interests. The sectarian war in the Middle East, one being fueled by Sunnis as well as Shias will continue. But finally Washington and others can talk to both sides of this divide to try to broker a reduction of tensions. No significant change is going to happen in Iran in the next few months. It didn't in China, it hasn't in Cuba or Burma, but over the next 10 years, if there is greater contact, communication, commerce and capitalism between Iran and the rest of the world, surely this will gradually empower those Iranians who see their country's destiny as being part of the modern world, not in opposition to it.

Then it wasn't until 2007 when we experienced the first outbreak in the island of Yap in the Pacific. Then over a period of a couple years, it worked its way across the Pacific, got to French Polynesia, got to Easter Island. Then when it hit South America and Brazil, with the enormous population of the mosquitos, which are a perfect setup to have an outbreak, that's why we're having the explosive outbreak now. So the fact we didn't know much about it before, is because it was a relatively inconsequential virus until it became clear that it caused these outbreaks.

The Pentagon's new targeting force: commandos with orders to capture or kill top ISIS personnel, carrying it out.

So, can the prime minister get a better deal for British business and a better deal for the British citizen? If he can, that's a good reason to stay in a reformed EU. I've never claimed that every business has the same view. Entrepreneurs will look at this differently. There are some who think we're better off out, but I think 80 percent about sums it up. About 80 percent of businesses want to stay in a reformed European Union. SOARES: What kind of voices -- what are they saying regarding those reforms? What changes would they like to see? You represent how many businesses? About -- (CROSSTALK) CRIDLAND: One hundred and ninety thousand British businesses. SOARES: A hundred and ninety thousands. From the business people, leaders you've been speaking to, what are they telling you? What changes would they like to see within Europe? CRIDLAND: So, they want to see the European Union do more of what it's good at and less of what it's bad at. SOARES: And that is? CRIDLAND: What it's good at is negotiating market access. Free trade deals all around the world so Britain's entrepreneurs can get out there and sell. And that can be creating an 800 million consumer market between Britain and the United States with the rest of Europe, or it could be completing a digital single market in Europe of 500 million people. What they're bad at, they tend to get involved in lifestyle regulation. They tend to get involved in employment regulation.

Moment after the gaffe, Harvey appears to complain to producers that the teleprompter had the wrong name and Miss Colombia was the winner but seconds later, Harvey publicly took the blame. HARVEY: This is exactly what's on the card. I will take responsibility for this. It was my mistake. It was on the card. STELTER: The real winner, Miss Philippines, printed in small type on the card, showing the perils of live television. Harvey tweeted an apology saying, ""I feel terrible"", and suddenly, Miss Universe was trending like never before -- and maybe that's why Harvey will be back. Entertainment Tonight reporting Harvey signed a multi-year contract just a few days before Sunday's contest. The company is not ruling out his return next year saying only, ""We do not disclose any information on our contracts."" Now picture yourself in Harvey's shoes, would you want a shot at redemption? (END VIDEOTAPE) STELTER: I think if I were Steve Harvey, I would want another chance. You know, keep in mind the synergy here -- Donald Trump sold this pageant to WME/IMG a few months ago. That's a giant Hollywood talent agency and one of the many celebrities it represents is Steve Harvey. So, it will make sense for them to remain in business together. But my sense is no final announcement about next year's host will be made for a long time. They do have almost 12 months to decide. Kate, back to you. BOLDUAN: Thanks, Brian. And thank you all for joining us. ""AC360"" starts now.",0.4208667517316806,2015-12-23
258799,438054,CNN,Insight,"would like an opportunity to lead? ATALLAH: Well, again, this is a question of institutions. He is the secretary-general of the PLO and, therefore, he is in line to become chairman in the absence of the chairman. That's a normal default movement. Now, the question of whether he has enough popular legitimacy, that question can be asked of any Palestinian leader right now. Even President Arafat's approval ratings were at 36 percent to 40 percent at their highest, and that -- it was in part a response to the fact that the Israelis were threatening to kill him every other month. The lack of support for individuals among Palestinian society at this point can only really be remedied through popular elections. MANN: What about Hamas and Islamic Jihad? They have been calling for collective leadership. Are they going to sit still while the old guard among the Palestinian leadership decides what comes next? ATALLAH: Well, I think Hamas will have to decide whether it wants to buy into a democratic process where it transforms itself into a religious party similar to (UNINTELLIGIBLE) inside Israel and pushes forward a religious platform, a platform of moral values, as we would say in the United States and move within a political spectrum that represents everyone's views. Or whether they want a militia power-sharing arrangement. I don't think that the Palestinian society at this point in time wants a militia power-sharing arrangement. There's been so much agitation among Palestinians for democracy, so much -- equal to the amount of agitation for independence. And those to conditions have been mutually exclusive. We've gotten neither independence nor democracy. Without elections, I think that even Hamas, which has a great deal of popular support among Palestinians, would find that support slipping. MANN: Amjad Atallah of Strategic Assessments Initiative, thank you so much for talking with us. ATALLAH: Thank you. MANN: We take a break. When we come back, a very different subject. Arafat's fortune. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MANN: One leading member of the Israeli government has a particular view of the confusion over who will succeed Yasser Arafat. Arafat has enormous sums of money at his disposal, Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said, and any difficulties with respect to a leadership transition in the Palestinian camp are related to that money. Welcome back. There are a number of estimates of Yasser Arafat's financial empire. Several years ago a one-time finance minister for the PLO estimated it was in the billions, but it could be that no one really knows except Arafat himself. CNN's John Vause has a look at the money and the mystery of what happens to it now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VAUSE (voice-over): In the end, could it have all come down to money? Palestinian sources tell CNN Yasser Arafat never made a will, and for more than a week, his wife, Suha, has been locked in a bitter struggle with Palestinian officials over hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe more.

I think he views Lebanon as the case study in the resiliency of terrorists' networks. SESNO: President Reagan pulled out of Lebanon. Rumsfeld learned from that, too, because the terrorists saw it as American weakness and didn't stop --Saudi Arabia, U.S. embassies in Africa, the USS Cole, 9/11. RUMSFELD: There's too many people being killed by terrorists. And the government of the United States simply cannot sit there and take the attack. SESNO: The first target, Al Qaeda and its Taliban sponsors in Afghanistan. Rumsfeld wanted to move fast. He had been hired to think differently, to transform the military. The time had come. Rumsfeld pushed the man in charge, General Tommy Franks, to use fewer troops, deploy them differently, exploit technology, move faster. DELONG: We used the northern alliance Army as our army on the ground, reinforced, now, with something that had never been done before, a team of CIA and special forces people. SESNO: He was on the phone with the commanders constantly. At times, they felt, micromanaging them, demanding results. DELONG: What he wanted was, like we run most wars, hit 500 targets a day. Well, sometimes there were only 50. But when Franks pushed back or when Franks said, Mr. Secretary, come on. And that -- then he would say, I got it and he'd stop. SESNO: Militarily, the plan to oust the Taliban was a stunning success, just a thousand U.S. troops working alongside indigenous warriors. PACE: What we learned in Afghanistan was that the home-grown armies would be loyal to their country, not to the despot leaders they had, and would, given the opportunity, fight for freedom. That's a mind set that I certainly had going in to Iraq. SESNO: But there was a major fault in the strategy and an ominous sign. It would show first in the stark terrain of Tora Bora where a crucial manhunt came up dry. MICHAEL GORDON, ""NEW YORK TIMES"" CHIEF MILITARY CORRESPONDENT: bin Laden got away at Tora Bora -- and I was there -- because we didn't have sufficient U.S. ground troops to do the job and relied on others to do it for us. SESNO: That was despite specific requests from CIA operatives on the ground for more U.S. troops. GARY BERNTSEN, FORMER CIA OFFICER: In the first two or three days of December, I would write a message back to Washington recommending the insertion of U.S. forces on the ground. SESNO: Gary Berntsen was the leader of a secret CIA paramilitary unit that had pursued bin Laden. BERNTSEN: I was looking for 600, 800 rangers, roughly a battalion. They never came. SESNO: Rumsfeld had won the first big battle in the war on terror but lost the prize, Osama bin Laden. He bet heavily on Afghan forces and said American troop strength wasn't the issue. RUMSFELD: We have seen repeated speculation about his possible location.",0.0790375712250712,2006-10-22
1022590,1314884,CNN,CNN Sunday Morning,"what we'll hear in Florida. ROMNEY: President Obama has no experiences running a business, and no experience running a state. Our party can't be led to victory by someone who also has never run a business and never run a state. STEINHAUSER: Rick Santorum finished third, but the former senator from Pennsylvania vowed to keep going. RICK SANTORUM (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let me assure you, we will go to Florida, and then we're going to Arizona and Colorado and Maryland and everywhere else. (CHEERS) STEINHAUSER: Ron Paul came in last, but the Texas congressman was still encouraged. REP. RON PAUL (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It looks like to not we will get four to five times more votes than we did four years ago. (CHEERS) (END VIDEOTAPE) STEINHAUSER: So, how did Newt Gingrich do it? Well, the exit polls tell the story. Listen, about two-thirds of the people there in South Carolina say they decided in the last couple of days, and those people went to Gingrich over Romney by a 2-1 margin. Gary, we're hear in the campus of the University of South Carolina. Got the CNN Election Express right behind me. We're packing up and we are heading to Florida. TUCHMAN: Heading to the Sunshine State. Hey, Paul, everyone knows that Ron Paul is going to be sticking around no matter what happens, but can Rick Santorum really stick around in Florida and beyond if he doesn't have good showings coming up right away? STEINHAUSER: He needs a strong showing in Florida, no doubt about that, but as of now, you heard Rick Santorum on CNN air last night saying he was going to Florida. They've already put his campaign telling us they put up ads in Florida and they're going to put up more in Florida. But it's tough right now. Santorum, Gingrich going after that same conservative crowd trying to be the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney. Only one of those two can survive -- Gary. TUCHMAN: You're right. You know, we also heard Jon Huntsman saying New Hampshire that his third place finish was enough to punch his ticket to South Carolina, and he dropped out. So, sometimes when candidates say those things, we don't always know if they're exactly true. So, either way, Paul, we really appreciate you talking to us and giving us analysis. It was really a stunning primary in Florida. It couldn't be even more stunning. Thank you very much, Paul Steinhauser. As Paul was mentioning, the Sunshine State primary next on the political calendar. It's set for January 31st, a week from Tuesday. Voting is actually started already. Early voting got underway in Florida yesterday and run through next Saturday. Then there's a break before the primary election day on Tuesday. The ""Miami Herald"" reports that more than 11,000, to be precise: 11,836 ballots cast on Saturday. There have also been more than 185,000 absentee ballots cast. That's very significant.
