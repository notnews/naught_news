PENHAUL: Well, there have been a number of developments on the search front, in fact, Nancy. Because the FBI specialist dive team, you`ll remember that that was requested, and that was going to be brought in. It was brought in, but those divers never dived. And those divers have now left, according to our FBI contact. And the reason they left is because no area was ever pinpointed for them to search. We`ve also talked to Aruba search-and-rescue teams. And they say today they have been doing their own thing, basically. Normally, they take the lead from the government in order to pinpoint certain areas where they can search. But the government ministries are no longer providing them with any area to search because most of the public areas have now been searched. So that throws up the question, where to search now? GRACE: Karl, wait a minute. You told me the divers left without putting a toe in the water? Is that correct? PENHAUL: Not a toe, not a flipper, Nancy. They haven`t been in the water. GRACE: OK, wait a minute. Wait. Wait. And you`re saying it`s because they don`t know which part of the beach to search? Why don`t they try starting with the beach where the guys say they took her? PENHAUL: Again, I`m not privy to that kind of information. But what one of the search-and-rescue team members did explain is that he would have expected the dive teams to be diving off some of the craggy shorelines where the currents are strongest, the currents that are being channeled in through that narrow stretch of sea between the southern coast of Aruba and the northern coast of Venezuela. But again, they`re also here as guests of Aruba. They can`t operate independently. And the FBI contacts have said it`s because the government of Aruba hasn`t pinpointed the areas where they should be searching. That`s why they didn`t go in the water. That`s why they`ve now left, Nancy. GRACE: Quick break, everybody. We`re going back live to Aruba. But first, to ""Trial Tracking."" Tonight, as you know, we have been looking for Patrick Welsh. Welsh, the 22-year-old college student who disappeared in April during a trip to New York City. His body was found last week in New York`s Hudson River. His family was contacted just last night. Patrick was a writing major. He had planned to graduate in December. No word on Patrick`s cause of death. As of tonight, what happened to Patrick remains a mystery.

444504,672888,CNN,The Situation Room,"you served in the White House under Bill Clinton. All of a sudden now -- we thought we knew the story, a year ago, when he pleaded guilty, paid the $50,000 fine, and had his security clearances removed for three years. But now it turns up that there was -- there is more to the story, and he actually took the documents, classified documents, top-secret documents, outside of the National Archives, and actually hid them underneath some construction site, and then came back an hour or so later to take them to his office, which shows that there was more than just a sloppy, nerdy Sandy Berger, which was earlier projected as the case, someone who just got overwhelmed. BEGALA: Yes. I say this as somebody -- I not only worked with Sandy. I love the guy. And I think he's a great patriot. And, yet, this was an enormous mistake he made. And let's call it what it is. It was a crime. Now, to his credit, after he committed the crime, which is a serious one, Sandy pleaded guilty. He confessed. And he took the punishment that the judge meted out, maybe not the punishment Jack Cafferty thinks he should get, but that's the punishment the judge gave him. And, so, at least there was accountability. And I do wonder if there is a bit of a double standard. The Bush administration prosecuted Sandy for this, as they should. It's a crime. But, yesterday, the president was asked at his press conference by Mark Knoller of CBS whether Mr. Bush was going to prosecute the people who leaked his aide Stephen Hadley's memo, which was classified. Or he might have been asked, why aren't they prosecuting whoever leaked Donald Rumsfeld's classified memo? And Mr. Bush said: Gee, it hasn't -- it's not fresh in my mind. I don't even know if I ordered an investigation. So, if a Republican leaks something, we don't prosecute. If a Democrat does, we do. It's a double standard. (CROSSTALK) BUCHANAN: First of all, this is not leaking. And this is not Sandy Berger taking responsibility. The reason Sandy Berger took responsibility is because he got caught. He lied his way up to the last minute, until they had the goods on him. And then he got himself the first-class attorney to get himself out of something. Get himself out of jail time is what he did. But the key here, I think, is, what this exposes is a man in the Clinton administration, a top fellow in national security, was deliberate in his effort to make certain documents were destroyed that would have obviously been incriminating to Clinton and... (CROSSTALK) BEGALA: Not incriminating. Nobody suggests they were incriminating. BUCHANAN: Well, no. Stop. You think that this man went in there and stole documents and destroyed them that would make him look good or make Bill Clinton look good? BEGALA: No, no. I'm sure...

They're trying to determine if Taylor ever handled so-called blood diamonds that were at the center of this civil war in Sierra Leone. And Campbell, she's involved because she said she was given ""dirty-looking stones"" after a dinner with Nelson Mandela in South Africa, presumably from Taylor. Here's what she told the court she did with those stones. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NAOMI CAMPBELL, SUPERMODEL: I wanted to find my friend who's someone I trust and does great things in South Africa for charity, to give them to him to do something with. I didn't want to keep them. And that's exactly what I did. (END VIDEO CLIP) BALDWIN: And Josh Levs now joining me a little bit of background and some of the courtroom drama today. Josh Levs, how is it in there? JOSH LEVS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There were some real fireworks in there. I mean, it's been interesting to follow this throughout the day. Yes, let me talk to you about some of the basics. First of all, how often do you even see anything remotely like this? You've got a supermodel, testimony at The Hague, and this is the war crimes trial of Charles Taylor. Let's recap who he is. He's the former ruler of Liberia. He's accused of stirring up a civil war across the border in Sierra Leone from '91 to 2002. About 50,000 people would killed there. All sort of atrocities have been reported from what happened there. And prosecutors argue that he paid for what he did using diamonds. Prosecutors actually rested their case more than a year ago, but they reopened it now to subpoena Naomi Campbell. And here's how she fits in. It was back in '97. She was with him at this event, along with other dignitaries. And she says it was later that night that these two mystery men gave her these rough, dirty diamonds that she assumed came from Taylor. And she has said that the next morning, she was with Mia Farrow and her former agent Carol White (ph), and she said that someone -- she doesn't remember who -- suggested the diamonds came from him. Prosecutors want to link Taylor to those diamonds. So here, today, is Naomi Campbell being grilled by Taylor's defense. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Neither of the men told you that these diamonds came from Charles Taylor. Is that right? CAMPBELL: Correct. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Furthermore, the next morning at breakfast, you did not tell either Mia Farrow or Carol White (ph) that the men said the diamonds came from Charles Taylor, did you? CAMPBELL: No, I did not. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The suggestion about Charles Taylor came from one of them? CAMPBELL: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And so, consequently, it is pure speculation that these diamonds came from Charles Taylor. That's correct, isn't it? CAMPBELL: I just assumed that they were. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But it's pure speculation, isn't it? (END VIDEO CLIP)",0.5574651087309315,2010-08-05

You would have to have it so bad that you would have to impact the supply chain and the workforce, working the supply chain. We're not even looking at numbers that close. So this is why I do not worry about it. Manufacturing is still working. And remember this is a cycle. So you see China coming back online. Italy will eventually come back online. It is going to be bad, but it's not bad forever. This is not a deprivation. If you have to wait a day or two, it doesn't mean it's going to last forever. I will tell you I worry about a lot of things, but this pandemic -- but this is not the thing I worry about. So that should make people maybe feel slightly better, but maybe not. So.

The World Health Organization says it shows that containment works. CNN's Steven Jiang with us now live from Beijing. You know, Steven -- containment may have worked, but the latest numbers from the -- about economy show that it is taking a huge hit because of the really tough measures that were put in place. STEVEN JIANG, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: That's right. The economic data for the first two months of the year, they were just horrific, you know -- the industrial output as well as investments in fixed assets which means infrastructure really plummeted for January and February. That's why you are seeing the authorities here increasingly trying to get businesses back online across the nation, including increasingly in Hubei Province, the epicenter. But they are obviously trying to strike a very delicate balance here. On one hand they really try to get the economic engine revved up again but on the other hand they're obviously, understandably worried about a second wave of new infections and cases, not only because if they get mass movements people nationwide again, that creates more chances of new transmission routes. But also they are dealing with the challenge of import (ph) cases as you were saying. That's why you see these two steps forward, one step backward kind of scenarios being played out nationwide where authorities often announcing, the ease of restrictions one day only to walk them back the next day. So I think -- you know, despite all these hesitations, there is slow but sure signs of things slowly getting back to some sense of normalcy, especially outside of the epicenter.

FUENTES: All of the equipment, all of the supplies involved in the Boston bombings was probably under a hundred dollars. GRIFFIN: And where would two brothers in Boston learn how to take a pressure cooker like this and make it into a bomb like that? Right here, of course. It's on the Internet. PAUL CRUICKSHANK, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST: The striking similarity between the Boston devices and a recipe which was put out by ""Inspire"" magazine in the summer of 2010. ""How to Build a Bomb in Your Mom's Kitchen."" GRIFFIN: Paul Cruickshank is a terrorism analyst for CNN. CRUICKSHANK: Now, these similarities include the fact that pressure cookers were used; an explosive shrapnel was used; a low- grade explosive powder was used. But, also, very specific stuff like the fact that ""Inspire"" magazine told followers that they should glue shrapnel inside the pressure cookers. Now, that's what was done in Boston. GRIFFIN: Published by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in English, the magazine was started by Anwar al-Awlaki, the American- Yemeni cleric who was killed by a U.S. drone strike. Cruickshank has been tracking al-Qaeda and this magazine for years. He says investigators are looking closely at whether the brothers Tsarnaev got their bomb recipe here. That could have larger implications. CRUICKSHANK: One of the largest concerns of Western counterterrorism officials is that ""Inspire"" magazine is still publishing new issues. In an issue that was put out recently, the magazine stated, ""We are publishing America's worst nightmare."" GRIFFIN: As investigators sift through evidence, the bits of bombs blown across the crime scene should yield other clues, too. RAYMOND LOPEZ, FORMER FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT: What were the components used in creating these devices? Coupled with that, you're going to have an investigation or laboratory sciences working on things like fingerprints, hair and fibers that may be included in there. And also tool markings. GRIFFIN: Ray Lopez is a former FBI explosives expert. LOPEZ: These things were made with tools, so there's going to be a look for tool marks that are left after these things were done. And that's going to be matched to any tools that they could find at any of the search sites that the investigators are working at. GRIFFIN: Officials now say at least one of the bombs was detonated with a remote control device similar to those used to control toy cars. Federal investigators must also now ask themselves hard questions like did they drop the ball with Tamerlan Tsarnaev? Two times, the Russian government approached the U.S. with concerns about the older brother, who later traveled to Chechnya. Upon his return to the U.S., Tamerlan posted this video, showing clear extremist tendencies. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), CALIFORNIA: What did he do when he went back for six months?

Plus, it is International Women's Day and in some countries women are still forced to choose between motherhood and career. Hello, everyone. And welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Michael Holmes. This is CNN NEWSROOM. And we begin with the breaking news. Stunning claims from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their highly anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey which aired just a few hours ago. Harry and Meghan speaking candidly about everything from the British tabloids to racism with a blaring message that they did not feel supported by the royal family. At one point, Meghan admitting she thought about suicide. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: But I knew that if didn't say it, that I would do it. And I just didn't want to be alive anymore. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES: Now that was just one of many bombshell claims. Another stunning revelation; Harry and Meghan say that there were concerns about what color their baby's skin might be. They were told the baby wouldn't get a title or have security. And Meghan says the tabloid reporting that she made Kate Middleton cry ahead of her marriage to Harry was exactly the opposite of what really happened; Kate made Meghan cry. Also revealed. Both Harry and Meghan said they felt trapped in the institution and, at one point, Prince Charles apparently stop taking Harry's phone calls. Harry says while he loves his big brother -- William, of course -- the two of them need space to heal. All right. Let's get more reaction to all of this with our Anna Stewart who is in Windsor, England. I guess a lot of people wondered how far this couple would go, and I suppose the answer is far. The notion that she was suicidal and wasn't being heard and that someone, whomever that was, raised the color of her child -- it's pretty stunning. ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: It's stunning. I think we were all prepared for some shocks and bombshells to be delivered, Michael. I didn't think I'd feel so concerned after this interview. The idea that Meghan felt suicidal at times when she was in the U.K. and as a member of the -- working member of the royal family back then -- I can't believe that all those public engagements we saw the couple at, I've been at many of them myself, that so much was going on behind the scenes.

RIPLEY: I don't think that it is over, Richard. I think that we're witnessing in real time the complete and radical transformation of Hong Kong, from a beacon of free speech, a Chinese speaking -- not democracy but a place where people were free to fight for democratic values, to a place where all of those dissenting voices are silenced, just like any other Chinese city. We've seen it with the ""Apple Daily"" newsroom that was ambushed by hundreds of police officers. It is now shut down because all of its assets were frozen. We've seen it with all of the pro democracy politicians and activists, either now in jail or in exile, or out of politics, signing pledges not to get back into politics. You saw it with the ""patriots"" only election, patriots, of course, those only considered loyal to Beijing, patriots in the eyes of the Communist Party. And now we're watching the erosion of academic freedom, even at the university level. Professors admitting to self censorship, especially with classes moving online, where they can be more carefully monitored. Even students reportedly rumored to be reporting their teachers for violations of the national security law because of bad grades. It's a chilling effect and the self censorship, I think, is bound to continue and intensify here in Hong Kong. QUEST: Will Ripley, thank you, sir.

WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Jim, thanks very much. Madam Secretary, thanks very much to you for joining us. Let me start with the deadly police ambush in Dallas overnight, the deadliest day for police officers here in the United States since 9/11. What would you do as president of the United States to prevent this from happening again? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, first, Wolf, I have expressed my deep condolences and concerns to officials in Dallas and in the region there, including the county judge, the mayor, the police chief, because this is an absolutely horrific event. I also want us to remember that, just 24 hours before, we had a killing, with the loss of life in Baton Rouge, in Minneapolis. And, right before talking with you, it appears we had an additional event in Tennessee. This is deeply troubling. And it should worry every single American. You know, we have got to do much more to listen to one another, respect each other. We have got to do everything possible to, you know, support our police and support innocent Americans who have deadly encounters with the police. This is a kind of call to action. And, as president, I would implement the very comprehensive set of proposals that I have been making for more than a year, including, we must do more to have national guidelines about the use of force by police, especially deadly force. We need to do more to look into implicit bias and we need to do more to respect and protect our police. Look at what happened in Dallas. Those police officers were protecting a peaceful protest, a protest of authority, that is a hallmark of America. And when the shooting started and everyone else was fleeing, the police were moving toward danger. So, let's start understanding, putting ourselves in each other's shoes again and really coming together as Americans to end this kind of terrible violence. BLITZER: Madam Secretary, how would you bridge the divide between police officers who now feel targeted and African-Americans who also feel they are targets? CLINTON: Well, I think that is the most important question, Wolf, because we've got to do a lot more to bring the police together with the communities that they protect, and we have to have better lines of communication. As I said, we need national guidelines to really set out when force should be used and especially when deadly force should be used. Some police departments have really taken that to heart. They have done an excellent job over the last years, trying to figure out how to prevent any situation from escalating into the use of force. And, at the same time, we need communities to feel that they can trust the police, that the police are trying to protect them and that is going to take a",0.0247993976877678,2016-07-08

You're the Democrat. But John McCain is out doing this, Meridian, Mississippi, today. He will be in the D.C. suburbs today, where he went to high school, tomorrow, on to Annapolis, retracing his life, trying to tell his biography, and connect the dots of his biography to why he wants to be president now. You have managed a Democratic campaign for president. If you were running John McCain's operation right now, is this how you would be spending this valuable time? DONNA BRAZILE, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Absolutely, because, otherwise, he would have to explain what's going on in Iraq, and Basra, and Mosul. And, of course, he would have to explain his -- his plan to keep us there for 100 years. So, I think it's -- it's important that he try to explain who he is, so that, later, when he has to explain why, you know, he supported the surge and, of course, where we are today, it might help him out a little bit.

RICHARD FRIEDMAN, MADOFF VICTIM: It's not enough just to say, OK, I'm guilty, put me away. What about all the other people involved? What about his family? I want to know. What about the money? CARROLL: Prosecutors say Madoff's fraud may have totaled close to $65 billion, money taken from modest investors, wealthy celebrities, even Nobel Laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. Leading to public fury so intense, Madoff wore a bullet proof vest to court. His attorney received death threats. Seeing Madoff taken from court in handcuffs for some is not justice. DR. GAIL SALTZ, PSYCHIATRIST: For some people that's not going to even be close to enough, because at the end of the day him sitting in jail doesn't bring you back your money. CARROLL: Victims like Miriam Siegman, who came to court, are still trying to comprehend it all. Her life savings gone. She showed me the food stamp card she now needs. Why did you come down today? What did you hope to... MIRIAM SIEGMAN, MADOFF VICTIM: I came down to, you know, damned if I know. I came down because I need to feel connected to what I'm feeling the result of what's happened but it's like living in a bubble of nothingness. (END VIDEOTAPE) CARROLL: I can tell she's still trying to get her head around what happened to her. The anger from many of the victims I spoke to also directed at the federal government, who they say missed the signs of Madoff's scam for so long. Madoff will be sentenced on June 16th. He's likely to spend the rest of his life in prison. His victims say prosecutors need to pursue the other people they suspect helped Madoff orchestrate his scheme. CHETRY: You just feel for them. Hopefully there's some way they'll be able to get some of their money back. But as we've been talking about, it will likely be pennies on the dollar, if anything. CARROLL: If anything.

FAUCI: It's a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death. TRUMP: We are going to be in two, three, four weeks by the time we next speak, I think we're going to be in very good shape. FAUCI: I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around. TRUMP: I think we are in a good place. FAUCI: I think it's important to tell you and the American public that I'm very concerned because it could get very bad. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER: And it has. Even in the days since he said that, it's gotten worse. Even as in states like Arizona, doctors and nurses say they're running out of protective equipment. Four months in and that is still a problem. We're still talking about personal protective equipment. Can you imagine that? In part because there's still no Federal effort to coordinate the purchase and distribution of supplies. Four months in, there's no Federal mandate on mask wearing or even the President support for statewide mandates. He is still flouting the guidelines. Even as his own Taskforce members implore and in some cases actually beg people to wear masks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR.

When I'm not in uniform, I wear them. They're white. They work very effective. And I think they're a great investment for the American people. DR.

And Bianca, come in here, because all the way along it's been trying to please all sides here, has been the challenge. If she delays this vote, what can she do here in order to change it, to get a vote ultimately passed here in Parliament? NOBILO: Well, the problem is, Julia -- as one MP put it to me the other day -- is everybody hates this deal for different reasons. So, it makes it very difficult for the Prime Minister to know what even to go back to the EU with and try and renegotiate even if that were to be possible. Because she knows that each of these interest groups within Parliament are still going to still have problems with it for their own reasons. So, she needs to decide who it is she is trying to target here. CHATTERLEY: Theresa May has entered the Houses of Commons here and she is speaking. Let's listen in. THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: -- EU and the political declaration, setting out our future relationship after we have left. I've listened very carefully to what is being said in this chamber and out of it. To what has been said in this chamber and out of it. By members from all sides. From listening to those views, it is clear that while there is broad support for many of the key aspects of the deal, on one issue on one issue, the North Ireland backstop, there remains widespread and deep concern. As a result, if we went ahead and held the vote tomorrow, the deal would be a rejected by a significant margin. We will therefore defer the vote scheduled for tomorrow and not proceed to divide the House at this time. I set out in my speech opening the debate last week the reasons why the backstop is a necessary guarantee to the people of North Ireland. And why whatever future relationship you want, there is no deal available that does not include the backstop. Behind all of those arguments are some inescapable facts. The fact that North Ireland shares a land border with another sovereign state. The facts that the hard-won peace, the fact that the hard-won peace, that has been built in North Ireland, over the last two decades, has been built around a seamless border. And the fact that Brexit will create a wholly new situation. On the 30th of March, the North Ireland/Ireland border will, for the first time, become the external frontier of the European Union's single market and customs union. The challenge, the challenge this poses must be met, not with rhetoric, but with real and workable solutions.

Britney responded by blowing off the judge`s orders and partying at will, as the public looked on in disbelief at the sight of a young mother, turning her life into a flaming wreck, from which it was impossible to look away. ALLISON: Britney really redefines train wreck. I mean, we no longer have to use the term train wreck. We just say she`s pulling a Britney Spears. She`s pulling a Britney! Oh, look at her.

Britney Spears is SHOWBIZ TONIGHT`s most controversial celebrity of 2007. And she seems determined to prove that she deserves that title, right up until New Year`s eve on Tuesday, she did not show up for a court-ordered deposition in her child custody battle, claiming she was freaked out by all the media that was waiting for her. But, what do you know? As you`re seeing here, ""Hollywood.TV"" caught her Tuesday night out on the town in, you know, what has pretty much become her usual element, hanging out at a gas station surrounded by the media and seemingly unfazed.

KIM SERAFIN, SENIOR EDITOR, ""IN TOUCH WEEKLY"": Yes. I think people have been saying that for a long time. What is her priority? Is her priority to get her kids back or is it to get photographed by the press? That`s why it`s so strange, because this is not someone who seems to be - who seems to mind that the paparazzi follow her around. She seems to encourage it. She seems to joke around with them.

Marco Rubio said the same thing as well. And now coupled with what Ted Cruz just said about if something changes that path to victory, you know, I will address that. Those sound a little bit like sabers being rattled, but at this point is there anything that can rattle Donald Trump? HEALEY BAUMGARDNER, TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER: I mean, I think the American people have spoken with the historic turnout that they've shown for Mr. Trump. And so I'm not quite sure where this rhetoric is coming from, from Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio and I think the focus needs to remain unifying the party and moving forward to defeat Hillary Clinton. BANFIELD: Let me throw up a couple of numbers that have come up. A recent Quinnipiac poll, these are head to heads in, you know, presumable races and, of course, since we don't have a Democratic nominee right now, you got a Clinton and a Trump match-up and a Bernie and a Trump match-up. But let's talk about the Clinton match-up. In Florida, she beats him by only a point. In Ohio, he beats her by four. And in Pennsylvania, she beats him only by a point. For his part, Bernie Sanders does better against Trump, significantly better, in fact, in all three states. So the question I have is, Tara, when Trump goes to this meeting on Capitol Hill on Thursday, there's so many issues, the RNC machine, these numbers that you're looking at, here are the Bernie numbers where he kind of trounces Trump on all three of those swing states which are so critical. But he -- he needs them and they need him. So nobody has a right to bulldoze through this meeting, do they, Tara? SETMAYER: Right. I mean, well, no one else has bulldozed anything except for Donald Trump. I mean that -- he's bulldozed and hijacked the Republican Party and is asking the 60 percent of the Republicans who did not vote for him to just fall in line when there are significant issues at question here and Paul Ryan, who spent his entire life fighting for conservative principles and is the speaker of the House. So, let's remember, he's elected by the people. The speaker of the House is the people's House. And since Donald Trump has emerged here, people like, you know, Charlie Cook, who is one of the gurus of political races and handicapping and things, they've actually said that it's possible the House majority, which is the largest majority Republicans have had since Truman, I think, is in jeopardy here. The Cook Report actually moves ten races to no longer leaning Republicans. There're up -- they are toss-ups.

A lot of this pointing to the fact that this population's a lot of frontline workers keeping what's been of the economy, keeping the food moving into this county and across the state. ELAM: They're really getting hit hard. Also, worth noting that half of the deaths, more than half of the deaths in the entire State of California are right here in Los Angeles County. We did see that the County announced more than 2,000 cases yesterday, 49 deaths, hospitalizations above 2,200 for the fifth day in a row. Obviously, that is a concerning statistic there. And the positivity rate, it is at 10 percent. It's been holding steady there just about for a while, but it is still of concern. They would like to see it getting lower but still because it did not go beyond that we are not going into a further stay-at-home order. However, to that end, the County is now going to start fining businesses that are not making it a priority to follow the guidelines and they're saying that this compliance and enforcement plan. They will have fines ranging from with $100 for the first offense up to $500 and a 30-day suspension of their license for these businesses that don't fall in line. Although they say that for the most part companies are doing their best to fall in line and to make this happen. But again it is so simple. Wear a mask. It would make such a difference if everyone wanted to get this economy back on its feet. Wear a mask, stay at home as much as you can and keep your hands clean.

You just heard Stephanie go through it and you're well aware you live there, the numbers in California. Is that overly optimistic to say we see evidence of a plateau? Is it too soon or do you see at least maybe the building blocks of it? DR. SEEMA YASMIN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: It is overly optimistic, unfortunately, John.

Let's take a look, shall we, at this evening's big roster for speakers here at the Republican National Convention. And you will definitely see some folks who haven't always had the most flattering things to say about Donald Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for one, who just in the last 24 hours said Trump was, quote, ""not my kind of conservative."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who says Trump is best scripted because he doesn't know much about policy. His former Republican rival, Dr. Ben Carson, who even while endorsing Trump said, quote, ""are there better people? Probably."" And then there is New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who some say is maybe still a little bitter about losing out on being on the Trump ticket.

I mean, these interviews have been going on apparently, for something like 90 minutes. Now, we should stress that we haven't confirmed this news ourselves, we've reached out to Amazon and to the FTC, haven't heard back yet. But you know, we saw earlier this morning, Amazon shares were dipping premarket on this news. Because you know, it really is just another reminder of the serious antitrust scrutiny that Washington regulators are putting on big tech, which is a really big deal, because big tech is really the heart of the bull market. Just earlier this week, we learned that 50 U.S. Attorneys General, they had announced this sweeping investigation into Google, Facebook, as well as facing scrutiny from eight states and the District of Columbia. And that's on top of Federal scrutiny. The FTC is investigating Facebook. The Justice Department is looking at Google. There's a House Committee that is also looking at big tech. So I think that what is really important here is that, you know, even if this doesn't result in some sort of a breakup of any of these companies, you know, there are costs here. I mean, there's obviously legal fees, there's distraction costs for the management, as well. And it really acts as kind of a cloud over the sector that we should expect will weigh on those lofty multiples for these companies. So Julia, clearly this issue is not going away anytime soon. CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's interesting. And I will make the point that Amazon argue all the way through that, look, they are just four percent of the U.S. retail market, even if you total what they are in terms of e-commerce sales in the United States, which is just shy of 40 percent. The question is does that defense hold when you're going down to the granular level in trying to understand how much and how much dependency there is on individual sellers on the Amazon platform. It's going to be fascinating to watch. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that. All right, let's move on. Apple investors seemingly unmoved by the latest announcements, 11 is the magic number.

GOERTZ: Well, and I understand that we do need women and Hispanics, but we are getting women - the woman and the Hispanic vote. I was with Mr. Trump in Arizona, and we won for Hispanics. I was with him in Nevada. We won the Hispanic vote there. He's winning the women vote in many, many locations. So I understand the tweet and what Mr. Trump is all about is results. He is a results-driven businessman, now politician. And he was just simply saying she's not doing a good job as the governor. And you heard the crowd erupt in favor of his comment. And that's just more or less like, come on, she can do better as a governor. And he's 100 percent behind doing good things for the state, as she knows, but it was just sort of, she hasn't been very kind to Mr. Trump, and you know that he will not back down to anyone, whether it's a male or a female. If you go after him, well, then he'll pull out your resume and say, you're not doing that good of a job. BANFIELD: You know what, I think you're spot on.

ROESGEN (voice over): Mayor Nagin says he should have chosen his words more carefully. NAGIN: If I could take anything back, that's what I would take, any references to god. I think that was inappropriate for that particular setting. It was something that I had discussed with a minister several weeks before, and for some reason, it became top of mine and it became part of that speech. It was totally inappropriate. ROESGEN (on camera): Inappropriate, but do you believe it, that this should be a majority African-American city? NAGIN: Well, I just look at the data. And the data tells me that from every perspective that the city will come back, and it will be, you know, a very diverse city, similar to what we had before.

Since his re- election to the Senate in 2000, Mississippi Republican Trent Lott has weathered many storms. 2002, he was pushed out as majority leader after some controversial comments. Last year, Hurricane Katrina destroyed his beachside home. So it was anyone's guess if he'd seek a fourth term. Today, Lott announced that he will run again.

It always seem like there are some kind of Wall Street types who find a way to make a buck on it. STEIN: Yes, yes. People will be selling short various types of securities that will go down if the debt impasse is not solved, all different kinds of securities. There are actually securities being custom made right now as a means of betting on whether or not there will be a default. So there will be people making great, great deal of money off this. It won't be you or me or you or I, it will be people who operate on a very high degree of dexterity and moving around huge sums of money. But the ordinary American will just get a lot of panic and nausea out of this, which is exactly what we don't need. We won't recover as long as people in this country, especially in the hiring arena, are scared. We won't recover with this much fear and Congress is generating a lot of fear right now. FOREMAN: The GDP number today didn't help any - they've revised this. Nothing is happening. What does this tell us about the economy? People keep saying Democratic side, they say it's recovering slowly. What do you think? STEIN: Well, there is no known economic theory under which having a government stalemate and defaulting on the bonds would help the economy. That is an unknown theory. If that's a theory of some of the Tea Party people and God bless their souls. They're very nice people then it's an unknown theory to everyone else. We have to have the government get together, unite behind a plan and go forward in such way that people out in the business say we're being governed by sound, sensible, careful grownup people and we are going to go forward and build this new plan in Spartanburg or build this new plan in Sacramento. We got to have a feeling that somehow, somewhere down the road we're going to have responsible Eisenhower type leadership. I mean, I keep going back to the fact, what would Dwight Eisenhower say about these people? I mean, he was a very, very fine Republican president. I think he would be horrified by the idea that they would stick to their convictions to a point where they would put U.S. Treasury bonds in default. I don't think Dwight Eisenhower could imagine that Americans would do such a thing to America. FOREMAN: A simple almost yes or no question here, do you think we're headed toward a double-dip recession, after watching all of this? STEIN: Well, it's -- if it's not a double dip recession already, it's a painfully, painfully cruelly slow recovery. A genuine double dip recession is almost unheard of. I think the last one is in 1958, 1960. There might have one at the beginning of the '70s. It's",0.1411023077406778,2011-07-29

MICHAEL NUTTER, FORMER PHILADELPHIA MAYOR & HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTER: Well, I mean, I said earlier, it really goes back to as secretary Clinton laid out yesterday in very measured remarks that were presidential in stature. She laid out the case for how this got started. It started with the ban on Muslims, started with insulting the Mexican community, started with insulting the physically disabled individuals. It starts the concept of Donald Trump is to insult as many people as possible, say anything you want and create an environment of fostering this hate. The secretary didn't accuse him of associating with these people. It's a fact he associates with them or encourages their support. Does not denounce people like David Duke and others.

NUTTER: Kayleigh, let me finish -- (CROSSTALK) MCENANY: -- you're talking about associate, well -- NUTTER: Kayleigh? Kayleigh? MCENANY: -- why did Clinton go to his wedding if he was such a bad guy?

NUTTER: What I'm saying here is -- (CROSSTALK) MCENANY: She went to his wedding -- (CROSSTALK) NUTTER: What I'm saying -- Kayleigh, cut it out. What I'm saying here is he has created an environment where all of this hate and controversy gets created. He's tangled himself up in it. And he has no pathway out. The reason you can't understand his immigration position is because he doesn't know what his immigration position is from time to time until he gets advice from someone else. BERMAN: Doug -- (CROSSTALK) MCENANY: Can I just quickly say, Mayor Nutter, I'm befuddled at you telling Trump supporters to cut it out. Your candidate put up an ad comparing him and allying him with the KKK -- (CROSSTALK) MCENANY: -- when we can do the same thing to you.

1258970,1570223,CNN,New Day,"(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The recommendations issued by a group of national security experts appointed by the president could lead to the most sweeping changes ever proposed for the NSA. JAY CARNEY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We felt it was important to allow people to see the full report, to draw their own conclusions. ACOSTA: Aimed squarely at the NSA's domestic and foreign surveillance activities revealed by the agency's former contractor and fugitive, Edward Snowden, the group's report doesn't hold back, stating the government should not be permitted to collect and store mass, undigested non-public personal information about U.S. persons. Among the proposals, end the practice of collecting data on nearly every phone call made, appoint a new public interest advocate to protect personal privacy and new higher standards before any surveillance on foreign leaders. An obvious nod to the firestorm over U.S. spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel among other heads of state and in a challenge to the culture of the NSA and its director, General Keith Alexander, the group urges the appointment of civilians, not military leaders, to run the agency. The White House says it understands reforms are needed. CARNEY: We need to make sure that we're not gathering intelligence solely because we can, but because we must, because we need it in order to achieve the objective of protecting the United States, protecting the American people and allies. ACOSTA: The question is what the president will decide. In a recent interview, he suggested the NSA could better police itself. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I'll be proposing some self-restraint on the NSA and to initiate reforms that can give people more confidence. ACOSTA: According to a source familiar with this week's meeting between top tech executives and the president, Mr. Obama repeated his goal of self-restrain, but indicated he may allow the collection of phone data to continue, but with more oversight and transparency. That may not be enough for members of Congress across the political spectrum. SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: NSA, you've gone too far. The bulk collection of Americans' data by the U.S. government has to end. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do have a right to privacy and we'll continue to fight this. (END VIDEOTAPE) ACOSTA: Now, the president is expected to lay out his proposals for reforming the NSA sometime next month. If it does not adopt all of the review board findings, you can expect to see a confrontation with Congress. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you so much, Jim. Now that we've heard from the president's task force, what changes can you expect to actually see in how the NSA operates? That's a lingering question for sure. Let's bring in chief national security correspondent, Jim Sciutto, for more on this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just want to be clear, a President Ron Paul would, therefore, not have ordered the kill of bin Laden which could have only taken place by entering another sovereign nation. REP. RON PAUL (R), TEXAS: I don't think it was necessary. No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. It wasn't necessary to do. PAUL: It was absolutely not necessary. (END VIDEO CLIP) ACOSTA: Now, Ron Paul says, you know, this is consistent with this small government views, that you don't goo into a sovereign country and do something along those lines. He says he would have worked through Pakistan to capture Osama bin Laden. He says sort of in the way that the United States worked through Pakistan to get Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. So, you know, Paul does come to this contest with some controversial views. This comes just after the GOP debate down in South Carolina last week where he repeated his support for legalizing drugs, including heroin. Guys, Ron Paul's one of those rarities in presidential politics. He will literally say whatever is on his mind. ROMANS: Sticks to his, you know, philosophical view. VELSHI: The government is not meant for these things. ROMANS: The funny thing about -- funny, I guess, the thing about the Bin Laden comment is that it's a one thing that -- it's one piece of bipartisanship we've had in some time is the patriotism over the killing of Bin Laden. VELSHI: Where is this getting him? Poll wise? ACOSTA: You know, I mean because of these views and because he's so willing to be outspoken about these views, this explains why GOP voters have always been a little weary of Ron Paul. He's a national candidate. Take the latest CNN polling, it shows Paul really in the back of the pack with about 10 percent of support. He does pull better than guys like Mitch Daniel and Tim Pawlenty and folks like that, but that is basically where he was four years ago when he ran in 2008. And, you know, the views on Paul also on evenly split inside the Republican Party, about 30 percent like him, nearly that same number do not. What Paul does have working for him, guys, is a very loyal and vocal following. You have seen this before at some of those informal straw polls like the CPAC convention earlier this year. You know, he, sometimes, wins those straw polls because of that vocal following but make no mistake, guys, he is a long shot for this nomination, but he will make it interesting. That's good for us.

A Russian fighter jet makes a dozen close-range passes over a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Black Sea. In other words, the Russians buzzed a U.S. warship repeatedly. The incident happened on Saturday. It's being described by the Pentagon as provocative and unprofessional. Let's bring in our Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr to tell us more. What message did the Russians want to send to the United States? STARR: Well, you know, provocative and unprofessional might be just the most kind words that the Pentagon has to describe publicly what happened on Saturday. They think that Moscow is sending them a message of harassment, to put it politely. You know, buzzing the USS Donald Cook, which was in international waters in the Black Sea conducting operations well announced publicly, and this Russian SU-24 fencer fighter jet makes a dozen low passes around the ship over a 90-minute period. It was not armed. It didn't have missiles under the wings. But, still, this is not -- you know, this is so far from standard practice at sea. And there was also a Russian frigate, another small Russian ship, shadowing the Donald Cook. So the Navy sees it as harassment. They see it as a political message from Moscow with tensions so high in that region over Ukraine. But the fact is, the bottom line is, the Navy says, the Pentagon says it will continue to conduct the exercises and the training that it's conducting and it really wants the Russians to back off. Carol. COSTELLO: Now, we know that Russian jet was unarmed, right? And the folks aboard the USS Donald Cook knew, too. I'm just thinking what that would be like to have a Russian jet flying, what, at 500 feet over my ship for 90 minutes? STARR: Well that's -- yes that's a really good point there. I mean unarmed, there were no missiles under the wings but in these low passes, you're absolutely right. It flew about 500 feet off the water and about 1,000 yards to the side. So, look, the ship knew, you know -- this airplane was not about to attack it, but this just isn't good seamanship. It's not good combat air practice. It's not the way military operations are conducted by responsible nations. And that's the point the U.S. is making. You want to send a message, do it diplomatically. But you know you get this close between military forces, accidents can happen. Things can happen. No one wants that, and this is not the kind of -- of venue, if you will, to send a political message. Don't mess with warships. Don't mess with fighter jets. You know? Act the way you're supposed to act at sea.

CNN's Matt Rivers joins me now from Mexico City. Matt, what are you learning about this? Is this part of a broader plan? MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jim and Poppy. I mean, in terms of this vaccine here in Mexico, this is good news for a region that could really use some. This agreement between Mexico, Argentina and AstraZeneca to start producing, eventually, somewhere between 150 and 250 million doses. Now, the timeline of this, AstraZeneca says it wants to finish phase three trials by November of this year. Assuming that those trials go well, that they produce a safe and effective vaccine, then production starts in the first three months of 2021. Now, how fast that these two countries can produce hundreds of millions of vaccines, how fast they can get it into the public, that remains to be seen. And it's also kind of a sobering reminder that best-case scenario here will be, you know, mid-2021 before a vaccination campaign really has an effect across Latin America. But still, when you look at the average number of deaths, for example here in Mexico, a vaccine is clearly, clearly needed. So this is good news. Meanwhile, down in Brazil, in the Brazilian state of Parana, officials there have said that they will work with the Russians on production of a Russian-developed vaccine, but they need a lot more information from the Russians before they're going to do that. And in that sense, they're kind of like the rest of the world, Jim and Poppy. You know, we've heard from Russia. They say they've got a vaccine, but they're not showing information about it. Is it safe, is it reliable? Can it be produced quickly? That's the kind of information that the Brazilians want before moving forward with Russia on that vaccine development. But clearly, you know, across Latin America, there are multiple different countries working on getting a vaccine to the more than 600 million people across the 33 countries in this region. SCIUTTO: Yes, there's kind of this international axis of people fighting science, right? Brazil and hydroxychloroquine, Russian vaccines and sadly sometimes our president echoing that.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you cut all the money from EPA and all the money from State, that's about $50 billion? TRUMP: I think the money is going to come from a revved up economy. You look at the numbers we were doing, we were probably a GDP of a little more than one percent. And if I can get that up to three or maybe more, we have a whole different ballgame. It's a whole different ballgame. And that's what we are looking to do. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAMEROTA: Senator, what do you think of that explanation? If he can get the GDP up to three percent, then the money flows in? KING: That's absolutely true, but there's no causal connection necessarily between what he is proposing to do and increases in the GDP. Increasing defense spending, for example, isn't going to increase GDP. There's always, growth is one of the important ways to get out of this. The question is, are the policies being annunciated going to contribute to economic growth? And I think the president is going to find that moving the GDP growth upward is a lot harder than it sounds. What we have to be careful with is what George H. W. Bush 30 years ago called voodoo economics, which is just cut taxes and everything is going to be great, the economy is going to grow and it will pay for itself. That has never proven to work. And so I think we just need to be careful. I want to see the numbers work, not a promise of, well, maybe growth is going to make it pay off a couple years from now.

Well, college admissions letters are finally in the mail, but paying for college could be harder than ever this year. Major changes in college lending have made it more difficult for students to get loans. And with spillover from the subprime mortgage crisis causing funding for loans to dry up, 55 lenders have dropped out of the federal student loan program just this past month. But there are some steps students of parents can take in order to secure a good loan. Try for federal loans first. They have the smallest fees, lowest interest rates, and allow students to defer payment until after college. Look into these before you look if to private loans. Make sure you shop around for the best possible interest rates and incentives. You don't have to stick with your school's preferred lender list. Use your school's financial aid officers. They can guide students on everything from the interest rates on loans to whether or not you'll need a co-signer. NGUYEN: Well, college student loans, mortgages, stock prices, we are following your money trail, weekdays. The economy, it is Issue number #1, so join us at noon Eastern.

SHAICH: Well I think we have to ask ourselves a question, and the question we have to ask is, what kind society do we want? The truth is we have the facts. One in six Americans -- 48 million Americans -- are food-insecure. Now, are there people in that group that are -- that are taking advantage of it in some way? I'm sure there are. On the other hand, are there people have real need? Absolutely. And the question we each individually have to ask is what kind of society we want? What does it mean? And how do we want to live? And that really falls into two things. What are we going to do personally? What is each of us going to do personally in our relationship with things like NGOs, nongovernment organizations, and charitable activities? What are we going to do with things like Panera Cares Cafes? Are we going to support them? And the other thing that we have to do is ask what do we want of our government? And what does our government going to do in the context of this? COSTELLO: But some might say that maybe some tough love is in order and that people who are, you know, don't have the energy to go out and find a job perhaps or -- or who just don't want to find a job or get a job that's higher paying so they can better feed their family and themselves and really the government is just enabling those kinds of people by handing out these food stamps? SHAICH: Well, this is the question we each have to ask right? I mean when we opened the Panera Cares Cafes, people said that -- in here -- these are cafes where there are no set prices. You can walk in and you -- you can order the entire Panera menu and you leave in a donation box what you think is what you can essentially afford with an expectation if you have the resources you need to pay it forward. People thought we were crazy, that nobody would do the right thing. The reality is these stores have been opened for a number of years. The reality is we'll serve one million people in them and -- and -- and these stores are self-sustaining and it's continuing to -- to work. The reality is, most people are fundamentally good. Not everybody is bad. Are there bad apples? Absolutely. That's what society is. But when we have 48 million Americans that are food insecure, we've got to ask ourselves is the problem that these individuals are all trying to game the system, or is there a real problem that we want to deal with as a society?

I think that as American -- (CROSSTALK) O'BRIEN: I'm sorry for interrupting. What do you think the chances are that he's going to be able to stay? And what do you think the implications are, because I know eventually what you're trying to do is to target the Obama administration's deportation policy? GUTIERREZ: Well, what we want to do is -- the deportation policy clearly enunciated by this administration in August of last year said, if you have American citizen children and you haven't violated any -- you haven't committed any felonies, which clearly Gabino Sanchez has not. It's -- driving without a driver's license. The last one was immediately outside his trailer park home in South Carolina. He's not a violent criminal. We should allow him to raise his children. And if you follow the policies as set out by the administration, otherwise what you're saying is undocumented workers in this country under the new policy and under the new guidelines for driving without a driver's license is equal to selling drugs, is equal to murder and mayhem in our community. It's not, Soledad. O'BRIEN: What do you think your chances are? As you know, the administration has deported more than a million immigrants? GUTIERREZ: I think they're good. We're going to take -- we're going to take -- here's what we're going to do, Soledad. We're going to take the document issued by Homeland Security and we're going to challenge them to do the right thing. When we sat down with the president, I and others sat down with the president, I think it is really clear that he wants to distinguish between those in this country causing harm and those that are kind of trapped in a broken immigration system, attempting to raise their American citizen children, and to have a viable future here in this country.

And this is a big thing when you start toying with the media and acting as if you own Fox, and you -- and if they report things badly, by God, you're going to punish them when it comes to the big debates. CABRERA: You know, CNN has learned that former Vice President Dick Cheney will headline a fund-raiser tomorrow supporting Trump's re- election. Patrick, does this now lay waste to the idea that traditional Republicans loathe Trump? HEALY: No, I don't think so. I mean, the reality is President Trump has very, very strong support in the Republican Party, and Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney, is in the House Republican leadership. She has been a very loyal foot soldier for the President in the House. So I think it's going to be both Liz Cheney, Representative Cheney, and her father who are going to be at this event. So I don't think it's a big surprise. What is interesting, though, is -- and you sort of wonder if the conversations will capture this. You know, Vice President Cheney has been pretty critical of the Trump foreign policy and sometimes comparing it to President Obama's foreign policy in terms of troop withdrawals, in terms of Syria, but also just asking the questions a lot of us ask in terms of stability. You know, does President Trump believe in NATO? How is he adding to stability in the world? And so, you know, I think Dick Cheney does still speak for, certainly, some people in the Republican foreign policy establishment who see the last 2-1/2 years as just -- you know, it's Trumpism. It's not -- it's not traditional Republican foreign policy establishment thinking. It's something very different. CABRERA: Let's talk about the Democrats briefly. The ""Times"" is reporting on the relationship between President Obama and his Vice President Biden and that the two had a conversation earlier this year in which President Obama told Biden, quote, you don't have to do this, Joe, you really don't. The article goes on to say he has communicated his frustration that Mr. Biden's closest advisers are too old and out of touch with the current political climate, urging him to include more younger aides. David, we've seen Elizabeth Warren have this huge spike in the polls. I just wonder, if Obama is as concerned about Biden's campaign as this reporting suggests, why isn't he one of -- one of the advisers of Biden in this race? GERGEN: I think it's a very delicate question about the relationship. Biden, obviously, wants to have the President's support. He wants his advice, but he doesn't want to be seen as a poodle for him. I think this is tricky. The ""you don't have to run, Joe,"" I don't think we know the context exactly in which that remark occurred.

And thanks to you for tuning in. Tonight`s lead, dishonoring our fallen heroes. This Republican shutdown of the government has created a new outrage that`s shocked the conscience of the nation. NBC News reports since the shutdown, the military has been unable to pay death benefits to the families of U.S. troops who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. This is marine lance corporal Jeremiah Collins. His family called him Jay. Jay died Saturday while serving in Afghanistan. Corporal Collins was just 19-years-old. His body was returned to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware yesterday. By now, his mother should have received a death benefit from the military. But instead, she`s gotten nothing.

For the sacrifice that our kids are making at the age that they`re making them, I don`t understand how this can be a benefit that`s withheld. I will not -- I won`t ever understand it.

Families of fallen troops are supposed to receive $100,000 death gratuity immediately after their loved one`s death to help them in the midst of their tragedy. Five service members were killed in Afghanistan this weekend. None of their families got this benefit. None. This is reprehensible. America is better than this.

BILLINGSLEY: Three health officials started making their way down the stairs to the pink house to go into the cell complex below and they were shot. One never returned. And, at that point I guess, they realized we have Taliban that are still willing to fight down in the basement. The reason he showed up was to actually bring the Mullahs there and to say look, look what your people have done and then hopefully to get them to call up the remaining fighters that were still in the bunker. He was most upset because their people had shown such discourtesy. VINCI: He was disappointment, obviously, because his deal had gone sour but he was really enraged and he tried to say, you know, I don't understand why they did this because we offered them food. We offered them a deal and they didn't respect our deal. But you could tell that inside himself he was really, really mad. PELTON: When I interviewed them, they were just really unrepentant about anything. They just said we fought for an idea and we didn't win. It's as simple as that, and that was basically how they summed up the whole Taliban movement. VINCI: You know betrayal, deception, these are rules of war.

Now we're learning more about the tactics they used and just how effective they were. Clare Sebastian looks at a protest that took place in Texas but it all originated in Russia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The small group of anti-Muslim protesters gathers outside an Islamic center in Houston, Texas, in May of 2016. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Down with the Nazis! SEBASTIAN (voice-over): A much larger counter rally forms across the street. Just another example of the struggle for tolerance and understanding in America. And yet this is different. The anti-Muslim protesters were responding to an event promoted on Facebook, called Stop Islamization of Texas, it was organized by a Facebook group named Heart of Texas. Heart of Texas, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, is among 470 fake pages or accounts Facebook turned over to Congress following its investigations into ads generated by Russia. Ads Facebook said came from an organization called Internet Research Agency, that according to people who worked there, operated out of this building in St. Petersburg, 55 savage in the streets (ph), more than 5,000 miles from Texas. The Houston rally, an example of a Russian effort that had real impact on the ground. While the stated mission of Heart of Texas was to promote Texans' secessionism, CNN has recovered parts of the account that suggest sowing religious, racial and social discord was also part of its playbook. One post asks, ""Since when has this country turned into a liberal cesspool full of all sorts of ethnic and sexual minorities?? Another raises the issue of voter fraud and another argues against gun control. The Houston rally was small and ended peacefully, according to the Houston Police Department and yet the Council of American Islamic Relations in Texas had alerted the FBI after a post on the Facebook event page threatened to, quote, ""blow this place up."" Fear and divisions on the streets of Houston, engineered from Russia -- Clare Sebastian, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) ALLEN: A new rule from the Trump administration means that many women may no longer have access to free birth control through their employer's insurance. CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're seeing the Trump administration essentially walk back this mandate. This is an Obama- era rule, that required employers to provide women with birth control through their health insurance. But with this new rule, it grants broad exemptions to companies that say they have a moral or religious problem to doing just that. So to put it bluntly, non-profits, private firms and these publicly traded companies can now stop offering free birth control through health insurance if they have, quote, ""sincerely held religious beliefs."" This is something Trump promised to religion groups when he was a candidate on the campaign trail that he would do. We heard press secretary Sarah Sanders defend",0.3009551374819103,2017-10-07

But, right now, the most important story we're following is on the Democratic side, because this race is a nail-biter, too close to call so far. Sixty-three percent of the precincts have now reported on the Democratic side in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton maintaining her slight advantage over Barack Obama, 39 percent to 36 percent, Edwards coming in so far with 17 percent. If you take a look at the raw numbers, 65,974, almost 66,000, votes so far for Hillary Clinton, just more than 61,000 for Barack Obama. That percentage remaining pretty consistent over these past two hours, since the -- two-and-a-half-hours, almost, since the polls closed at 8:00 p.m. Eastern -- Hillary Clinton slightly ahead of Barack Obama. We're in no position yet to project who the Democratic winner in New Hampshire will be, because this -- this race remains close. It could be a very long night. We're going to have to wait, perhaps, for all the votes to be counted on the Democratic side. The precincts are reporting, 63 percent so far.

We know that John McCain has captured the Republican presidential victory, the primary in New Hampshire. We know that John McCain has won a major comeback for him. But the story on the Democratic side remains too close to call, at least so far between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, with 66 percent of the precincts now reporting. Hillary Clinton remains atop, 39 percent to Obama's 36 percent. It's been a consistent 3 or 4 percent advantage for Hillary Clinton, going back at least two hours, since about 10 percent of the precincts have reported. She still remains atop over Barack Obama. We're watching this story unfold very, very closely. We're going to make sure that we get it right before we project a winner in New Hampshire. But we're watching the numbers very, very closely right now. No one is watching these numbers more closely than our own John King. You've got a good understanding of that state of New Hampshire.

ASHER: And I was just thinking you know what, we've talked a lot on this show about this K-shaped recovery and how COVID is only going to -- yes, anybody, whether you're black, white, rich or poor can get COVID but in terms of how it affects people economically, it's vastly different. The K-shaped recovery means that inequality is only getting worse with COVID-19. And it's important to remember that a lot of these micro- businesses are run by minorities. And so when you help these micro-businesses, they're very small, they don't necessarily need that much in terms of loans, they only have 1 to 10 employees but when you help them you can actually make a dent in reducing income inequality in this country, particularly racial income inequality. BHUTANI: That's right. Micro-businesses -- we look at density, so micro- businesses per hundred people in a community. By adding just one micro- business to that community, you can have a reduction in unemployment; in fact, one micro-business will create one or two other jobs in a community. Over time -- we looked at data from 2016 to 2019 -- the addition of one micro-business per hundred folks in a community will lead to an increase of $485 of median household income in that community. That's a huge dent. And we work with unrepresented minorities all the time that are running these businesses. You talked about savings, you talked about access to capital. Zain, these folks don't even have the relationships with the banks to get access to that capital. So we really have to be creative in how we support them because they go back and support their local economies and make a difference where it matters. ASHER: Yes. It's huge. The access to capital aspect of it is huge because, obviously, larger companies they have the connections with the banks, they know all the big banks whereas for micro-businesses, it's much harder. I'm just wondering what people who are watching, everyday viewers, can actually do. Because I know that during the pandemic I said to myself, OK, I'm going to try and shop local and I'm going to buy from small businesses and where I live but I've never really thought about micro-businesses. So what can viewers do to help these micro-businesses? BHUTANI: Micro-businesses are all around you. We don't think of them but they're actually the backbone of most local communities. If you're shopping local, if you're buying local, if you're engaging with your yoga studio which is closed or your -- I'll give you a story.

We want to bring you that report we promised you a little earlier from CNN's Ben Wedeman. He is in Jordan, a country at peace with Israel but where anti-Israel sentiment is running high. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ask almost anyone in Jordan's Beqaa refugee camp, home to more than 100,000 Palestinian refugees, and they'll say the same thing: peace is dead. ""The Israelis can slaughter every one of us,"" says Abu Khaled (ph). ""We won't give up one inch of our land."" The talk here is no longer of peace, but of a jihad, a holy war against Israel. ""It's an excellent idea,"" says Ayman (ph), ""so we can fight like the people in Gaza and the West Bank, so we can die like them."" (on camera): The anger in this refugee camp is echoed across the Arab world, as pressure mounts on Arab leaders to stop talking and do something to act against what is widely seen as Israeli aggression. (voice-over): But the people here have little faith in those leaders, many of whom are seen as corrupt and weak. ""They're just protecting their throne,"" says this man. ""Here, even the smallest child knows this is true."" ""The Arab leaders can do nothing,"" says another. ""Americans control them. So it is up to us, the people, to lead the jihad."" The majority of the 4.5 million Jordanians trace their roots back to Palestine, having fled a succession of Arab-Israeli wars since 1948. The ties are still strong, emotions still raw. Since the recent fighting broke out, Jordan has been the scene of some of the Arab world's most tumultuous demonstrations. Last weekend, protesters tried to take their grievances over the border separating Jordan from the West Bank. Only Jordanian water cannons and a cloud of tear gas held them back. The optimism born of Jordan's 1994 peace agreement with Israel has vanished, leaving Jordan's King Abdullah ruling over a restless population. MAHMOUD SHARIF, ANALYST: He cannot stand in the face of the cruel and ugly realities developing in Palestine. He cannot tell his people to accept what's happening as something natural. WEDEMAN: And increasingly, the anger is turning against the United States, Israel's friend and closest ally. ""Our first enemy is America,"" says Abu Jamal. ""America is the enemy of the Muslims. Israel isn't our real enemy, America is."" Here, they say the leaders of the Arab world and the United States ignore these voices of rage at their own risk.

Prosecutors focusing on the police search\nof Peterson`s house in the days after his wife Laci was reported missing. First up on the stand this morning, an evidence\ntechnician, Doug Lovell. He examined and photographed Scott Peterson at the police station on January 4, more than a week\nafter Laci went missing. Lovell said he wanted to see whether there was evidence Peterson had been involved in a struggle\nby checking his body for bruises, but there were no scratches or marks anywhere on his body.\n \n\n And get this -- on cross-examination, Lovell conceded that police lost 93 of the more than 100 digital photos they took\nof the Peterson home. Then Modesto Police Officer Kim Castro, he was watching the Peterson house on the night of December\n26, an effort to show the house was being monitored.\n \n\n The third witness who is still on the stand, Modesto Police Detective Henry Hendee. Hendee is responsible for searching\nthe nursery and bathroom in the Peterson home and Peterson`s truck. He testified that he found blood on the inside of the\ndriver`s side door and other places inside the truck as well. He also found small chunks of cement and receipts for cement\nproducts. Remember, prosecutors allege that Scott Peterson made anchors, may have weighed Laci`s body down with those cement\nanchors.\n \n\n And then later today Hendee described they found a hair about six inches long on a pair of pliers in Scott Peterson`s\nboat, said that there appeared to be some kind of material substance on the hair. Later it turned out that hair appears to\nbe Laci Peterson`s and of course prosecutors say she didn`t even know that he owned the boat.\n \n\n So the question is, are all of these witnesses helping the defense, though, more than the prosecution? Now let me --\nlegal team first. Let me introduce them -- Gloria Allred, attorney for Amber Frey, the girlfriend of Scott Peterson, expected\nto take the stand later this month, former San Mateo prosecutor, who`s been inside the courtroom all day, and former FBI profiler\nCandice Delong.\n \n\n OK.

794701,1064969,CNN,The Situation Room,"really striking to me that -- you know, in my interview in ""The New Yorker,"" Justice Stevens really talked about how much the court had changed since 1975, how much more conservative it had become, how much the court had moved to the left on so many issues. The case that he was particularly outraged about was the Citizens' United case earlier this year, the case that said corporations have the same right to free speech as individuals. He wrote a blistering dissent in that case. But just in general, here you have this Republican appointee, this life-long Republican, a moderate Republican, an endangered species, talking about how he -- the court was really a very different place now than the one he joined almost 36 years ago. MALVEAUX: Let's talk a little bit about what's making news today. Justice Clarence Thomas's wife, Virginia Thomas, started a new group now. It's a nonprofit organization, a lobbying group that is linked to the same philosophy as the tea party group, espousing fiscal conservatism, a limited government. It's called Liberty Central, and there's a quote that she gives the ""Los Angeles Times"" saying, ""I adore all the new citizen patriots rising up across this country. I felt a call to the front lines with you, with my fellow citizens, to preserve what made America great."" Now experts say this is not a violation of the ethical rules, but clearly, this might give a look -- an appearance of partiality, would it not, to have Justice Thomas's wife engaged in something so partisan here? TOOBIN: I'm really not sure it's all that dramatic a development. You have to consider who Ginny Thomas is. Ginny Thomas is a veteran political activist in her own right. She used to work for Dick Army, the former Republican leader in the House. She's has worked for various conservative foundations. She is an outspoken conservative, just like her husband, the Supreme Court justice. You know she shouldn't have to give up her career to -- because she is married to Clarence Thomas. Now could she get a job that is somewhat less explicitly political? Sure. But it's not prohibited by the laws. It's not prohibited by any ethical rules. And my sympathies are basically with Ginny Thomas here. MALVEAUX: I used to talk to Ginny Thomas all of the time in covering President Bush, and obviously she was a big part of the Heritage Foundation. TOOBIN: Right. MALVEAUX: A very conservative group. Is there anything that Justice Thomas needs to do, however, to reassure the American people that he's not aligned with his wife's philosophy or the lobbying? Would there be cases where he would have to recuse himself? TOOBIN: Well, if her organization were a party to any case before the court, of course he would have to recuse himself there, or if she filed a brief in some case. But I don't think she'd be silly enough to file a brief in a Supreme Court case.",0.4216059766475361,2010-03-15

FOREMAN (voice-over): The fury is not merely because Trump is winking at an old stereotype, suggesting American Jews may be as loyal to Israel as they are to their own country. Rather much of the anger flows out of a sense that Trump has been here before, inviting the creator of an anti-Semitic comic to the White House, telling a group of Jewish Republicans the Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, is your prime minister. And when rightwing marches in Virginia changed, ""Jews will not replace us,"" there was Trump, acknowledging their violent clash with counterprotesters but also giving them comfort. TRUMP: You also had people that were very fine people on both sides. FOREMAN: Still politically, this all makes sense. Less than a quarter of Jewish voters supported Donald Trump in 2016. He has a strong group of support among white supremacists who don't like Jews much anyway. And among Christian evangelicals, there are those who believe that Trump is an historical figure sent to fulfill a Biblical prophesy that will raise up the State of Israel before the coming end of days -- Tom Foreman, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) VAUSE: Ron, this slur of the disloyal Jew goes all the way back to the Book of Exodus. It has been trafficked by anti-Semites around the world. It is something else, though, to hear it coming from the president of the United States. BROWNSTEIN: It was something else to hear him go back coming from the president of United States, language that has been talked about would get you fired from any major company in the country. What's really striking about is the set of assumptions that cascade upon each other, that for American Jews,, for most American Jews, the principal issue in how they choose between the parties here is the policies towards Israel and even if you believe that is true, that the only way to express support for Israel is to express support for the Netanyahu government, which is essentially turning itself into an arm of the Republican Party, going all the way back to 2012 with Mitt Romney against Barack Obama and certainly coming here to give a speech against the Iran nuclear deal. Just all of the assumptions that go into this, not to mention the idea that the thought that anyone outside of Jews or Jesus are really waiting for a second coming. In all of these ways, the president compounds the mistakes and that help explain why he is very unlikely to improve upon that 75-15 split among American Jews, despite all of his process with the Netanyahu government. What this really does not only hurts him, Netanyahu has made a political blunder of historic proportions by aligning himself with this administration that is so unpopular among the vast number of American Jews and creating the impression that the Israeli government is now aligned with the Republican Party, making it even",0.1716600529100529,2019-08-22

Let's talk about the future of the parties and go through this quickly the issue obviously the president is highlighting its immigration. And I want to go back to 2013 after the 2012 laws, there was the growth and opportunity project report that came out. They autopsy as it's called from Republicans. And one thing that they highlighted here was reaching out to Hispanics. Let's see how that applies to what we're seeing today. And the finding was, ""If Hispanics perceived that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States, they will not pay attention to our next sentence. It does not matter what we say about education, jobs or the economy. If Hispanics think we do not want them here, they will close their ears to our policies."" What's the impact of what the president is saying and how he's saying it about this caravan? We understand that these are people who are potentially trying to seek asylum in the United States, what's that mean to potentially growing the GOP Hispanic vote? EVANS: That's a great question. And if you look at the demographics nationally, Latinos are going to be the fastest growing segment of the American population. So, there's no but doubt for both parties. Both the GOP in the Democratic Party creating messaging which appeals to Latinos is going to be very important. In my opinion, long-term thinking for millennials, which we both are. What we grew up in the most diverse generation American history. And I'm hopeful that because you look at what's happening the rhetoric on both sides, we have a situation where politics is polarized probably, for the most part, it's ever been in our lifetime. Going forward, I'm hopeful that given the way that we have both grew up, we can break that down. And because the demographic is going to continue to change, now looking at it -- (CROSSTALK) BLACKWELL: But is the president wrong in his rhetoric here? Because what he's saying and how is he saying, it is -- does not correspond with what you're describing you want the future of the party to be. EVANS: Well, I think that what the president is doing, he's saying there has to be law and order. There has -- there has to be borders and able to protect what we've created is the best country on earth. And if we enable anyone to just come forward in a caravan and assume that they're just going to be able to cross the border, is that going to continue to progress with the foundational principles we built the country on.

65099,70580,CNN,Larry King Live,"perhaps they had politics on their mind rather than law, your response? SEN. ROBERT GRAHAM (D), FLORIDA: My response is that this is an excellent court. It's elected through a nonpartisan process. Orrin, it's the same process that Connie Mack and I have been using in selecting federal judges that you have so kindly approved through your Judiciary Committee. I think these are seven fine jurists, and, they have reached an opinion based on their closely-divided interpretation of the law. COSSACK: But Senator Graham, how can they split? This is 4-3 opinion which may very well decide who the next president of the United States is, and yet they seem to be so far apart. The one -- the majority said that the standard that Judge Sauls used was wrong. The minority said, well, it wasn't -- at least two of minority said it wasn't wrong and one of the minority said that even if it was wrong, it was the right decision. How can that be? GRAHAM: Well, it can -- you know, Roger, what lawyers do is they make their living looking at the law and trying to reconcile disparate positions and sometimes those positions are irreconcilable. And so, you end up with a court which divided 4-3, but that is the legal system that we have. And I think the questions that we are about to come down to is do we believe that this process should be one which is essentially a political process or one which is rule of law? And if this next president, whoever it is, is going to have the legitimacy to be an effective president of the United States for our people and the world, it is critical that he be selected based on the rule of law. GRAHAM: Senator Hatch, we've just heard what Senator Graham says, it has to be law and not politics, but I think what you said is that perhaps you suspect the Florida Supreme Court of playing a little politics? HATCH: Well, I'm not even going to say that. I'm saying that they have ignored the Florida law. Now, look, Senator Graham and Senator Mack have worked very hard to get nonjudicial activists in the federal courts and they've been very successful in getting judges through the nomination of the Judiciary Committee and I've helped them because of good way they've worked, but this different. Let me just not -- let me just not make Orrin Hatch statements here, even though I think I would do my best to be honorable and honest, let me quote the chief justice of this court.

(END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: Apologize for what? It's Cory -- using his first name, not Senator Booker -- who should apologize. HABERMAN: Right. Somebody owes me an apology. I mean, really, that part was the part to me that just was so incredibly resonant of something that the current president would say. This is -- this is not just sort of an idle discussion about words. Joe Biden needs the support of African-American voters in this primary if he's going to be successful. And this is raising an issue that a lot of people have had concerns about with him, that he is just -- Is he right for this moment? Does he understand the current discussion about race, not just nationally but within the Democratic Party, and what a generational divide there is? And again, he made a cleanup effort last night at a different fundraiser, where he did say what you just described, which is again, I think, what he was trying to say. But we don't -- you don't get points for what you're trying to say. The current president often is trying to say something, and then we are told that we misunderstood him. Again, I think that this is going to raise a lot of new questions about, you know, Joe Biden's viability over the next several months. CAMEROTA: Because what he seems to be saying and what we often hear President Trump saying, or at least demonstrating, is that they don't really feel like playing by 2019 rules. HABERMAN: Right. CAMEROTA: I mean, this has happened a few times to Joe Biden now. HABERMAN: Yes. CAMEROTA: Which is, like, some vague recognition that there's new rules. But he doesn't want to play by those new rules. HABERMAN: I think the problem for Democrats is also that, again, it's really -- you can't really criticize Donald Trump for playing by new rules and then say, ""We're going to do the same thing."" I think they are trying to figure out what this all means. I mean, Donald Trump's biggest strength, as we have talked about many times, is a refusal to be shamed. And that is not necessarily something that we have seen Democrats want to emulate. So I'm not sure how this plays out. We say one top adviser to Joe Biden leave the campaign amidst this.

A lot of vote counting still to be down, but we could safely now and the Republican Governors Association has already congratulated Bob Ehrlich. He will be the Republican nominee for governor against the incumbent Martin O'Malley. Brian Murphy was the Tea Party candidate but he's pulling just about 18 percent of the vote at the moment. So, in that race in Maryland, Bob Ehrlich trying a comeback. He will be the Republican nominee in a very closely contested governor's race there. Now, let's get the latest on Delaware. We're still at 37 percent of the vote. This is the national message right now. Everyone is watching this race for the national message. This is a race to get the seat held by Joe Biden. For the Republican nomination, veteran Republican Congressman Mike Castle, a former governor of the state of Delaware, a moderate Republican, 45 percent. The Tea Party favorite, Christine O'Donnell, who lost to Joe Biden back in 1996, I think it was, she is winning at the moment, 55 percent.

We're reducing taxes, but at the same time, if I win, if I become president, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country. We won't be losing anything other than we'll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be. So this is a plan that's simple, that's a major reduction, I think people are going to be very happy. We've already had some very good reviews. I did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country. They love it. They say why hasn't this been done before and this is my wheelhouse. That's what I do well. The economy is what is do well. Whenever they do polls, I always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but I won't say that. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: That's from his news conference today. In a nutshell, his plan cuts the number of tax brackets in half to 10, 15 and 25 percent at the top. There is a down from 39.6 percent, the capital gains tax would drop, the estate tax would vanish and certain hedge fund earnings would be taxed as regular income. Mr. Trump says his healthy friends will not like that part and he says that non-masters of the universal will like what they see promising half of American households will pay no incomes tax whatsoever under this plan. The thing is, most already don't. And that's not the only way in which this plan opened a question. Erin Burnett, as we said, had a chance to ask some of those questions. She joins us now.

ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST, OUTFRONT: That's the big question, right, and I kept pushing him on that. Fundamentally, it seems like the way this is going to be paid for. And by the way, we're talking about trillions of dollars in tax cuts, right? This is an incredible amount of money is basically through growth. His campaign says we only need the economy to grow at three percent and this will pay for itself. A lot of economists think that they would need much more growth than that. But that is the but. This is a classic conservative plan in that one regard if you cut taxes, people are more productive and we will pay for itself.

This is an active crime scene, what you're looking at, one block away, and this is where the dumpster, the reciprocal is, that the explosion took place outside of it. They are now confirming. But they are processing the scene right now, they did confirm minutes ago that they have gotten video at that moment in time when that explosion took place. They are currently collecting more video. They are asking anyone that has any information, video or being an eyewitness. They would not go so far as to say if there was a device involved, but that there was an explosion. They do say that they will continue to give updates through the night as they see exactly what it is that they can report. But it is an active crime scene. They did say they believed it was intentional. An intentional act. They do not believe at this point that there is any correlation at all with terrorism. No link, no threat to New York City, but they did confirm, that just blocks from here, 27th, they are investigating another situation, would not say exactly what was that was, does not appear an explosion went off, but all forces are in that area right now.

Of course, as for former FBI Director James Comey, he took many notes that he's talked about, about his interactions with the president, and, of course, the special counsel will be interested in Comey expanding upon those. The president actually weighed in on Sessions' interview on Tuesday. REPORTER: Are you concerned about what the attorney general told the special counsel? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATE: No, I'm not at all, Kristen. Not at all. REPORTER: Did you talk to him about it? TRUMP: No, I didn't, but I'm not at all concerned.

Errol, I know you've been long waiting to get up at 3:00 in the morning to join us here but we appreciate it, nonetheless. Especially on a huge day in this Russia investigation. Among the developments we can put up on the screen -- hard to put them all on one graphic. But Bob Mueller seeks to question the president, some written, some verbal. Jeff Sessions was interviewed last week. James Comey was interviewed last year. Andrew McCabe was asked in the oval office who he voted for. How in your eyes did yesterday change at least the perception or the direction of the investigation? ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, it's certainly among other things putting to rest any lingering notion that this is a witch hunt, a fabrication, that this is politically motivated and there's nothing there. Throughout the last year really, the president has not acted like somebody who has nobody to hide. Every piece of information we get suggests that there's been active directive sort of interference in this investigation, attempts to discredit anybody who touches it. And a president who doesn't I think fully at -- at best I think you'd have to say doesn't fully understand his role compared to that of the FBI and the Justice Department, that these are not just a bunch of investigators and lawyers who work for him. That their oath is to the United States, that their independence is critical to the proper functioning of those agencies. And over and over again, you see the president kind of stomping all over that. Again, for anybody who is maybe tuning in to this for the first time -- we talk about it every day -- but it's like, are these the actions of a man with nothing to hide? And the answer to that to me is obvious. ROMANS: When you look at who has been interviewed in the probe at this point, it is a long list now. What does it",0.2667696256805167,2018-01-24

Ahead, the strong reaction from a Jewish group that says it is not enough. Welcome back to EARLY START on this Wednesday. I'm Ana Cabrera. SANCHEZ: Great to see you this morning, Ana. I'm Boris Sanchez. We are 31 minutes past the hour. And we start this morning with growing concerns among immigrants across the country about plans for more aggressive immigration enforcement. Guidance just released by the Department of Homeland Security could pave the way for a huge expansion of undocumented immigrants detained and deported. There's no doubt, much of this will come up as DHS Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visit Mexico City, they'll be meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto and his cabinet to discuss border security and trade. Now, let's take a closer look at this new plan from DHS. It increases the number of immigrants who face expedited removal from the country with almost no court proceedings. It also sets in motion plans to end the catch and release policy that limits who can be released pending a hearing. That means that detention becomes the default for thousands more immigrants. And that, of course, takes more resources. So, the plan calls for a surge in immigration judges and facilities. The guidance also orders more resource for ICE and Border Patrol. CABRERA: Now, DHS officials stressed that the agency would still target criminals. But they admit that by giving broad latitude to field agents, immigrants not targeted under President Obama may now be deported. DHS officials say they plan to enforce existing laws, and that there will be no deportation force of National Guard troops, for example. Also, there will not be huge roundups of undocumented immigrants. The Trump administration wants to emphasize that the DACA program protecting so-called DREAMers will remain in place. Now, this new guidance on deportation coming as we await another big immigration move from the White House, that revised travel ban. More on that now from CNN's Jeff Zeleny.

1030712,1323925,CNN,Connect The World,"MAX FOSTER, HOST: Iran says it's making great progress towards its goal of nuclear self-reliance. Today, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad unveiled what were billed as the first domestically-produced fuel rods. Iran also says it's created new centrifuges that can enrich uranium faster. Now, the United States is downplaying that news, saying Iran's advances are, quote, ""not terribly new and not terribly impressive."" But as CNN's Reza Sayah reports, Iran is determined to prove that nothing can stop what it calls its right to a peaceful nuclear program. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REZA SAYAH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Iran calling this a ""great day of achievement"" for what it calls its ""peaceful nuclear program"" in a ceremony in Tehran clearly designed for maximum publicity. Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the head of Iran's nuclear program making some important announcements about the nuclear program, Iran clearly using this day, using these announcements as a way to send a message to the West and Israel that it's moving forward with its nuclear program, and it's not deterred by the economic sanctions, the pressure, and threats of war. It's important to point out that none of the announcements from Tehran were surprises. Iran had long ago announced these undertakings to the IAEA, the UN's nuclear watchdog. In his address, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad praised the nuclear program and also, in his vintage style, mocked nations who already have nuclear bombs that are expressing fear that Iran is now going after a bomb. MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator): They have 10,000 bombs and they say they are against bombs. Well, are you making fun of yourselves? The whole of history will laugh at you, will ridicule you. The Iranian nation knows what it is doing. SAYAH: Even though Wednesday's announcements were no surprise to anyone monitoring Iran's nuclear program, look for the finger-pointing and the war of words to ratchet up in the coming days, Israeli leaders already sounding the alarm that this is Iran taking another step towards the capability of building a bomb. All this is, of course, taking place against the backdrop of Iranian nuclear scientists being assassinated in Iran over the past few years and attempted assassinations of Israeli diplomats in places like India and Georgia. Reza Sayah, CNN, Islamabad. (END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER: Let's give you some more context, now, about what Reza just called the backdrop of Iran's nuclear announcement. Perhaps no country has more concerns about Iran's nuclear intentions than Israel. It's been trying to rally global support for tougher action against Tehran. And now, it's pointing to a series of attacks in world capitals as proof that Iran is a state-sponsor of terror. Israel blames Iran for box explosions in Thailand as well as bombs in India and Georgia that targeted Israeli diplomats. Today, Thai police charged two Iranians in connection with Tuesday's bombings in Bangkok. Another Iranian suspect was apprehended in Malaysia.

2233903,2553227,CNN,Cuomo Prime Time,"CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESEARCH & POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA: Well, in fact, you're right, the hospitalizations are going up, and they're going up in many states, not just a few states, like we saw this summer. But you can actually also glean a great deal of information from the testing results. People can say ""We're testing more. That's why we're finding more."" But when you actually look at the rate of positivity, meaning how frequently is someone found to be infected, there, if you are just testing more, then the rate of positivity is going to go down, meaning if I sample twice as much, for the same number of infections, it will be half the rate of positivity. Our rates of positivity-- CUOMO: Well hold on a second, Doc? OSTERHOLM: --are going up and in some locations-- CUOMO: Doc? OSTERHOLM: Yes? CUOMO: Say it again. I didn't get it. OSTERHOLM: OK. So yes-- CUOMO: People think if you test more, you are only getting more positives because you test a lot, so don't test so much, and you're actually better off that way. Say again what you're saying. OSTERHOLM: Right and - and what I'm saying is, if you test more, but the percentage of people who are positive continues to go up, that means that the size of the pool of people, who are infected, is actually also going up, so that if it was just the same number of people, in the community, and you are testing twice as much, then your rate will be half as much. But if you are testing twice as much, and the rate goes up four times, that tells you there is a lot of new transmission in your community. And that's what we're seeing right now. Even ahead of the hospitalizations, we're seeing an ever-increasing number of people who are infected. And even more problematic than that, in many of our locations, up to half of these people have no known source of exposure, because that's how much virus is floating around, in our communities, right now. CUOMO: So, Anthony, what Osterholm is saying is being told to the President. You and I both know it. He is making a political decision. ""Well I'm not going there. I'm not running with that narrative. I'm going to run that they get the science wrong all the time. I did the right things. We're OK."" Why?

He's also got this reality distortion field around him, and he's got sycophants now that are feeding that.

So, at this point, the chorus continues to grow, but you can't understate how impactful this one is. We will see what happens over the next 24 hours.

I'm joined now by White House Correspondent for ""The Washington Post,"" Toluse Olorunnipa and CNN's Senior Political Analyst and former adviser to four U.S. presidents, David Gergen. David, what do you make of Northam's defense that he's not in this blackface photo, because he says he can actually remember the time he did put on shoe polish and darken his face and this wasn't it? DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST AND PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER TO NIXON, FORD, REAGAN & CLINTON: Well, he didn't restore his credibility in the press conference and now Senators Kaine and Warner along with Bobby Scott, they've put the final nails in the coffin. There's no way he can survive this now. And in my judgment, Ana, he made three serious mistakes along the way. Several days ago, he came out to issue very troubling remarks about what Democrats would like to see on abortion, on third trimester abortion, that he actually said that they would envision that the child could be delivered and then a decision would be made about abortion or about living. And that properly - that opened him up to all sorts of charges of infanticide, really hurt the party. Then he came in yesterday not prepared for that first press conference, apologized and said it was him in the photographs, which he should have prepared himself for whatever he was going to say. And today he showed up saying what he said yesterday was wrong that he has changed his mind, he wasn't in the photograph. But he produced no evidence. Nothing that would be helpful on the other side.

910600,1192845,CNN,News Stream,"BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Kristie. In fact, that's what we'll all be watching for over the next few days, exactly how significant this is. Basically, what happened after that meeting at the Elysee Palace a short while ago is that the French have agreed to an exchange of ambassadors. There's going to be a French ambassador in Benghazi, a seat at the Transitional National Council. And there's going to be someone from the Transitional National Council who's going to become the ambassador here in France. So, from a diplomatic standpoint, the French are the first to recognize this Transitional National Council that's fighting against Gadhafi, Moammar Gadhafi, and has been for the last few weeks. From a real practical standpoint, however, there's a little bit of a discussion going on in French circles, because when you ask the French -- there's a public opinion poll that's just out today that indicates that 63 percent of the French do not want to see any kind of armed intervention that would involve French troops or United Nations troops in Libya. So, from a real boots on the ground standpoint, the French are definitely against it. But from a diplomatic standpoint, there seems to be a lot of action. Alain Juppe, the foreign minister here, said just a bit ago that European countries should take concerted efforts -- make a concerted effort to recognize the Transitional National Council and further destabilize Gadhafi if it's possible. And, in fact, there is an informal meeting with the European foreign ministers going on right now to see what kind of joint action they can take -- Kristie. STOUT: All right. Jim Bittermann, joining us live from Paris. Thank you very much indeed for that. Now, a no-fly zone will be just one of the options on the table as Western powers meet to discuss a course of action for Libya. NATO defense ministers are gathering in Brussels, and they're all too aware of the risks involved in military intervention. Now, Phil Black joins me live from the Belgian capital. And Phil, what is the latest word from the NATO meeting. PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kristie, NATO defense ministers have just started their meeting in the building behind me, and they're here today to talk about their military options. But despite those strong calls from Libya's rebel leaders for some sort of military intervention from the West, you can almost be pretty certain today that NATO is not going to endorse that sort of action, certainly not at this meeting. We've already heard from the NATO secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who has said that NATO does not intend to intervene. And it will certainly not conduct any sort of operation without a United Nations mandate. So, the answer for the moment is no, not yet. They are not going to act on their own.

So they know back all the way back then. As the story goes, Prince and Sinead O`Connor had the same manager, and that`s how Sinead O`Connor even became aware of the song. What I`m told is Prince doesn`t like it when people cover his songs. He wasn`t a big fan of that. Of course, her version went on to become a much bigger hit. From what I understand, they never really like each other. There was no love loss between Sinead O`Connor and Prince. That also has to color the lens through which you look at this Facebook post and you see how she wrote it. The other thing about it is, according to these guys who were in the band with them, Prince had no hobbies. His hobby was to go play more music and that`s why he was up around the clock, playing all the time to clear through chords and ideas until he came up with something he wanted to build out into a full song. He said he was a relentless rehearser and would stay in rehearsals for so long, that`s what they saw him do. They didn`t see him do anything else. He lived for his music. FRAZIER: And that is the Prince that most people who had access to him saw, that guy who was relentless with his music. So it is ludicrous for Sinead O`Connor to come back now with this. PINSKY: And the fact -- I`m sort of glad this is happening. I`m sorry Sinead and Arsenio are not getting along, but the fact somebody is being held accountable for their social media post, it`s about damn time. You know what I mean? This is $5 million. Is she going to end up paying some money for this? ELIZABETH: You know, it will probably settle, because that`s how lawsuits go. But thank goodness we`re putting our feet to the fire and saying, you can`t do this. She could have obviously made a confidential report to the police or D.A. she chose not to, she chose to use her social media account for bad, and she should be punished for that. PINSKY: Use it for bad. Lots of people do. Kevin, I have a feeling we`re going to see more stuff this week about this Prince story that really is unsettling. I`m fearful it will taint the legacy.

They couldn't get out of their own way. So I mean, you know getting the timing right which is something at least in the campaign mode, Obama has been pretty good at. It's something that they are very thoughtful about. You know for instance he resigned his Senate seat. He's making clear he doesn't want to be part of whatever rough movement or last minute legislative foolishness goes on in Congress. DOBBS: How many senators do you think are thinking - I wish I could resign right now? LOUIS: Yes, exactly and just put it off for another six weeks and start over again which is what he is choosing to do. DOBBS: Diana, your thoughts - this is an absolute mess. Obviously this economic crisis is getting worse and not better. Is there any appetite you suppose in Washington, D.C. at all to say stop. Enough. The bailouts have to end and we have to draw a line here. This week we heard that the republicans will not go along with a bailout of Detroit. Your thoughts? WEST: Well I wish that there were sentiments to stop. If we remember back to a week or so ago, we have massive majorities in the House and Senate for the democrats who are very gung ho to continue the bailout. And you know, of course President-elect Obama was also one who signed on to it. So I don't sense any clear headed thinking except for maybe on this panel in terms of wanting to call a pause to this tremendous waste of billions. DOBBS: Right. Hank, the appetite if you will for prudence and responsibility and an end to these bailouts are manifesting itself. Because Christopher Dodd said that he couldn't find a republican vote for the bailout in Detroit. Do you think the result will be as apparently the democratic leadership in Congress now will wait through until the Obama administration is in place? Do you think that there is a likelihood that we will not see a bail out at all either then or now? WEST: It's impossible to believe for a moment that the Obama administration, thinking politically or from a policy perspective won't do something to aid Detroit. Because when you talk about Detroit, you are not talking about the city of Detroit. You are talking about a region and an economy the region is depending upon the auto industry. Something has to give. I think they will put it off and come up with some kind of plan, but I don't think it's going to be with the kind of richness that some would like frankly. DOBBS: All right.

Our Jeanne Moos counts the ways. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOSS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Take a good long look, the face of Barack Obama after announcing he will be the nominee. Absorbing all that applause as the first black presumptive nominee goes down in history. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Historical is the word and we can't use that enough. MOSS: No, they couldn't. BLITZER: This historic night. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Truly a history making night. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Profound historic importance of tonight. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Obama has just made history. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They were here when history was made. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is a historic moment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: History unfolding. MOSS: For once, history unfolded at a faster pace than even that other favorite election night phrase. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Best Political Team on Television. MOSS: Or BPTOT. The media blogs like to call it. But in this case, every political team agrees. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And American history has met the 2008 presidential campaign. MOSS: Even the history maker himself repeated it. OBAMA: Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign. MOSS: One of her supporters held up ""Newsweek"" with Hillary on the cover, while one of his supporters held up ""Newsweek"" with Obama on the cover. May the best cover candidate win. BLITZER: CNN can now project that Senator Barack Obama has enough delegates to secure the Democratic presidential nomination.

Brenda Cassellius, superintendent there for Boston schools, we appreciate all the work that you all are doing, and we're thinking of all of you. Thank you for being with us. CASSELLIUS: Thank you so much, Christi. SANCHEZ: Still ahead, the family of Ahmaud Arbery didn't hold back during the sentencing of the man who murdered. Very emotional moments in court, and what's ahead in the case, after a quick break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) SANCHEZ: So after nearly two years of waiting, Ahmaud Arbery's mother says her family finally got justice after all three men convicted of killing her son were sentenced to life in prison. PAUL: Remember, Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was chased and shot dead while he was running. This was back in February of 2020. It took the release of video of Arbery's killing, though, and national outrage for prosecutors to even bring charges. Here is CNN's Ryan Young. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDGE TIMOTHY WALMSLEY, SUPERIOR COURT, CHATHAM COUNTY, GEORGIA: Today the defendants are being held accountable for their actions. RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Two of the three men convicted of killing Ahmaud Arbery sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in prison. Travis and Gregory McMichael received life without the possibility of parole. WALMSLEY: After Ahmaud Arbery fell, the McMichaels turned their back to get a disturbing image, and they walked away. This was a killing. It was callous. YOUNG: William Bryan Jr. sentenced to serve life with the possibility of parole after 30 years. WALMSLEY: He had grave concerns that what had occurred should not have occurred. And I think that does make Mr. Bryan's situation a little bit different. However, Mr. Bryan has been convicted of felony murder. YOUNG: Before reading sentence, Judge Walmsley paused for one minute. WALMSLEY: I want us all to get a concept of time. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to sit silently for one minute. I kept coming back to the terror that must have been in the mind of the young man running through Satilla Shores. YOUNG: And the court heard powerful statements from Ahmaud Arbery's family. WANDA COOPER-JONES, AHMAUD ARBERY'S MOTHER: I laid you to rest. I told you I love you, and someday, somehow, I would get you justice. YOUNG: His mother spoke directly to her son and to the men responsible for his death. COOPER-JONES: These men have chose to lie and attack my son and his surviving family. They each have no remorse and do not deserve any leniency. This wasn't a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact. They chose to target my son. And when they couldn't sufficiently scare him or intimidate him, they killed him.

We're going to go live to Selma, Alabama, momentarily, the two top Democratic presidential candidates appearing literally yards away from each other at two different churches in historic Selma. We're going to have extensive coverage this hour of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, what they're saying to win votes down south. All that coming up. First let's check in with Fredricka Whitfield for a quick look at what's in the news right now. (NEWSBREAK) BLITZER: Fred, thanks very much. Selma, Alabama, the site of a very bloody but pivotal civil rights march that took place 42 years ago today. Among those in Selma commemorating the march and courting the crucial African-American vote are the Democratic presidential frontrunners, Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. CNN's Mary Snow is following this intriguing political situation for us. She's outside the First Baptist Church where Senator Clinton is expected to be speaking soon -- Mary. MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, good morning, and Senator Clinton not yet here but crowds waiting outside for her to arrive here. So many people saying today that they consider this an historic day, and many say that they feel that they are on the brink of history because the two Democratic presidential candidates are here in Selma on this anniversary of bloody Sunday. Now, a short time ago, Senator Barack Obama arrived at a church just a few hundred yards down this road, and basically what's going to be happening is that Senator Obama and Senator Clinton will be speaking simultaneously almost at church services so close to together. Senator Barack Obama was asked by a reporter this morning what did he think of the fact that the lines outside the church where he's speaking seem to be longer than the church where Senator Clinton is? You might hear those cheers, Senator Clinton just pulling up now and the crowd going to greet her. Senator Barack Obama, though, kidding",0.0388245281134525,2007-03-04

One of things playing out big here in Iran is the fact that the company that owns one of the tankers, in fact, the one in that video, apparently said its sailors are saying that they don't believe that the ship was hit by a mine. In fact, some of those sailors apparently saying they believe it was projectiles that were fired at the ship. Of course, unclear how much situational awareness those sailors would have had in the moments leading up to the explosions, and then as the explosions were occurring as well. The Iranian, however, firing back at the U.S. The Foreign Minister Javad Zarif accusing the U.S. of trying to destabilize the situation of trying to undermine diplomacy in the Middle East. Of course we always have to keep in mind that the attacks took place as Iran's supreme leader was meeting the Prime Minister of Japan. But one of the things the Iranians are very much making clear, which is something they have said in the past as well, is that they say if this confrontation escalates they are not going to be the ones who are going to back down, Martin and Christi. PAUL: All right, Fred Pleitgen thank you so much. In the meantime, President Trump is convinced that Iran was indeed behind these attacks. The big question this morning is, if that turns out to be true and Iran was responsible, what does the U.S. do about it now? SAVIDGE: CNN's White House Correspondent Boris Sanchez joins us this morning and Boris, we understand that a key U.S. ally is also supporting the president's claim that Iran is responsible? What have you learned? BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Martin and Christi. The U.K. is standing by the United States on this suggesting that it couldn't have been anyone else, really, that it was most plausibly Iran that carried out this attack. President Trump has made it clear that he essentially believes that Iran is written all over this attack. He pointed to that video that you just showed purporting to demonstrate that the Iranian ship was removing the unexploded mine from that oil tanker. The president was asked about this yesterday on a cable news show. He used the opportunity to attack his predecessor Barack Obama and the Iran Nuclear Deal. The president saying effectively that Iran is doing this out of desperation because their economy has tanked due to his harsh stance against them, the removal of the United States from the JCPOA as well as harsh sanctions. You noted that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Iran this week. There was some speculation that he might be brokering a potential meeting between American and Iranian leadership.

A separate civil trial to determine the cause of the accident is set to begin on Monday. And the cash-strapped. U.S. Postal Service is making an unlikely jump into the clothing and accessory business, announcing a new line that it plans to call rain, heat, and snow. The unofficial motto has been licensed to a Cleveland-based company which will design and finance it. The new line could generate new revenue for the postal service which just reported a $1.3 billion loss for the end of 2012. And I, for one, am going to be curious to see, Wolf, what exactly that new clothing line looks like. But we do know the name rain, heat, and snow. So, we can let our imagination wonder with that, Wolf. BLITZER: So, what you're saying is, you can go to the post office in addition to buying some stamps or roll of stamps, you can buy a new outfit? Is that what you're saying? SYLVESTER: Yes. You know, who knows what it's going to be. I'm guessing with the name that it might be maybe jackets, maybe some outerwear, something like that. But, certainly, it's a novel idea to help the postal service and they certainly could use the money right now. BLITZER: Yes. Maybe they'll be doing coffee producer over there.

NIKKHAH: I interviewed Harry just before he met Meghan the month before. And we talked about, you know, his private life, at the time. And he described it as massive paranoia that sat inside him, with regards to who he could possibly embark on a relationship with. So I think that made it very difficult to find someone, who could cope with that kind of spotlight. CAMEROTA: And what happened to his mother was never far from his mind. NIKKHAH: Harry and his brother, still, feel that, you know, the paparazzi and press intrusion were, certainly, partly, responsible for his mother's death and thought, why would anyone want to put up with this for me? CAMEROTA: Harry wanted to keep his relationship with Meghan private, as long as he could. But just four months after that first date, the news was out, and the paparazzi pounced once again. JUNOR: I mean, there was a photographer who got inside Meghan's house in Toronto. The paparazzi were camping on her mother's front lawn, and following, you know, and harassing all members of her family, anybody really, who knew her. CAMEROTA: Despite starring in a T.V. show, Meghan is relatively unknown. Now, the British press wanted to know who she was and if she was fit for the Royal Family. NIKKHAH: She was a woman who had been married, people were fascinated by the fact that she was divorced, people were fascinated by her background, her acting, a career woman, how would that work, being with someone in the Royal Family, and that's not what we've seen before. CAMEROTA: They also have not seen someone biracial dating a member of the Royal Family. And some of the conversation is blatantly racist. AFUA HIRSCH, WRITER: There was one newspaper headline saying, straight out of Compton, suggesting that she was from a gang-ridden neighborhood. And would Harry be dropping around for tea in gangland, which was very clearly racially loaded. COYNE: A whole another issue exploded, which was the number of rather horrific social media racist comments began to flood in, from the darkest vilest corners of the internet. CAMEROTA: The Royal Family responded in unprecedented fashion, with Prince Harry's team at Kensington Palace, releasing a statement, confronting the, quote, abuse and harassment Meghan was facing, saying, ""This is not a game, it is her life and his."" Why is it that you think that Meghan's upbringing, her race, why did that garner so much attention? JUNOR: In the past, members of the Royal Family, princes, would have married princesses. And when Harry's father, Prince Charles, was looking for a wife, it was also a requirement that a wife should be a virgin and a member of the church of England. COYNE: You just go back a few generations in the Royal Family, and everything that you can say about Meghan Markle disqualifies her from marrying Harry. This is",0.8554765093004513,2021-06-27

I came from a two-parent household; I had three siblings; and I got plenty of vegetables, and lots of exercise. All these things were true about me.

BATTISTA: ... and you were out in the working world or college or whatever, what was your life like? RICHARD: Well, I had to work very hard to accomplish the things I accomplished. I did manage after a terrible elementary school career -- never being able to get anything higher than about a D -- I got in junior high school and I pulled myself together. And I just worked as hard as I could and I finally was able to focus enough. I did get straight A's through high school and college and I got two college degrees.

And there`s more at stake here. I know that Simon wants to keep her from filming with the kids, so he is going to do whatever it takes to get full custody and get them out of her house and off camera. GRACE: Patricia Saunders, clinical psychologist, you`ve seen so many child abuse and child neglect cases. And as I`ve always said, when I was working at the battered women`s center, it`s across every socioeconomic. It`s not about education. It`s not about race. It`s not about money. Same thing with child neglect and child abuse. It doesn`t matter if you`re rich and gorgeous and beautiful and you`re on the ""Real Housewives"" of whatever. It still happens. In homes you`d never imagine it. And listen, Patricia, if we`re hearing about not bathing the children. They`ve got bugs in their hair. They`ve got a broken bone that they weren`t taken to the doctor. That`s what we know of. Those are the allegations that we know of. What is that we don`t know, Patricia? PATRICIA SAUNDERS, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST: Just use your imagination, Nancy. There`s a litany of possibilities. Sexual abuse and worse. That there`s a great book called ""Lost in the Mirror."" This woman is so busy with herself that the children are not even pieces of furniture for her. Pathological narcissism, to be technical. GRACE: Right now no charges of sex abuse. No criminal charges filed yet. These are court documents in a civil case. Unleash the lawyers. But first Stacey Newman. What more can you tell me, Stacey? STACEY NEWMAN: Tamara has just spoken out and said these allegations are B.S. They`re hurtful for the children, Nancy. Remember, Simon himself was actually on the show with their children. So how bad can this show actually be for the kids if he himself was on it with the children? GRACE: Well, you know what? I`m not as worried -- Renee Rockwell, Peter Odom, we`re not as worried about them getting filmed on this show as I`m worried about possible lice and not being fed and a broken bone.

LAURA MOYE, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA: Can we be sure that this man is not innocent? Can we be sure that the conviction of Troy Davis back in 1991 is still reliable?

We don't know if there were other individuals who volunteered to carry such bombs. We don't know if there are additional devices that were built, constructed in the same way. It would be unlike al Qaeda to build just one, just based on my own experience. And so they're rightly concerned.

And, later, one-time presidential candidate John McCain weighs in on the Romney campaign's latest self-inflicted controversy. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KING: Tonight, as part of our continuing look at the major dividing lines in campaign 2012, we grade President Obama on an issue that is also a major challenge for Mitt Romney, health care. Let's first look at the president's major health care promises. One was to deliver near universal access to health care. Another was to close an expensive prescription drug coverage gap Medicare recipients know as the doughnut hole. And another major promise from the president, he told most families, especially middle-class families , they'd see their health care costs go down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And if you already have health insurance, we will lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) KING: So has the president kept those promises? Well, yes, is the answer to sign universal or near-universal coverage. You may not like the law, but, yes, the president has signed that into law. Yes would be the line here. Yes, eventually, is the answer when it comes to closing the Medicare doughnut hole. The health care law phases in those costly changes between now and 2020. And on cutting premiums, if you scored it today, it would be a broken promise. Costs were up again in 2011, but we will score this one in progress. Why are we doing that? Because the true test will come after the health care law is fully implemented in 2014.

178846,317622,CNN,Live From...,"MILES O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR: With us now is former CIA Middle East operative Robert Baer. He's the author of several scathing criticisms of U.S. intelligence over the years. His latest book, ""Sleeping With the Devil: How Washington Sold Our Soul for Saudi Crude."" The title speaks for itself. Mr Baer, good to have you with us. All right, let's about that 28 pages that we can't see. If you were with the CIA and had a clearance, you could see it. What would you suspect would be in there? ROBERT BAER, AUTHOR, ""SLEEPING WITH THE DEVIL"": I think the information -- information like this, 28 pages, you can do what we call sanitize it; you remove the sources and the methods, and you can still publish it. You just state the facts. You don't say where you got it from. So it's undoubtedly something to do with political sensitivities concerning Saudi Arabia. O'BRIEN: Political sensitivities or national security, or both? BAER: Political. O'BRIEN: OK. BAER: Well, it includes national security, because look at it this way -- if there is enough information in those 28 pages to indict Saudis inside Saudi Arabia, possibly officials, and the Bush administration indicts them and the Saudis don't turn them over, where are they going to be in the war on terrorism? A lot of the information that was published in this report, I would indict some of those Saudis that have gone free, more than Zacarias Moussaoui, who is in jail now and may go to a military tribunal. The point is the Saudis will not turn these people over to us for investigation or trial, and that's the dilemma this administration is facing. O'BRIEN: Let's talk about the funding issue. There is some allegations out there that there really was perhaps some very direct funding of some of the 19 hijackers by Saudi interests. It's kind of hard to follow the money trail, of course, but the allegations are out there. BAER: It's complicated, but what we do know is there was a Saudi agent, a presumed Saudi agent, someone who the FBI believes is a Saudi agent, that met two of the hijackers and set them up in San Diego. He paid money. He put money down. It was undoubtedly government money. It's this kind of suspicion that is causing Bandar, the ambassador, so many problems. Who are these people? Who supports them in the kingdom? And the Saudis are asking us, trust us, we've gotten care of this, we're taking care of terrorism in the kingdom. But the point is, we've trusted them in the past and we've been betrayed. O'BRIEN: All right, but the issue here from the U.S. perspective is that a relationship with the Saudis is at the very core of U.S. national interest, and nations don't have friends, they have interests. And in this case, our interest is that oil. So don't we have to take the Saudis, warts and all? BAER: We have to, but",0.0686251549800247,2003-07-25

Do you want proof that kids desperately need this kind of thing? Look no further than Michael Brewer. Three boys charged with drenching the 15-year-old with rubbing alcohol, setting him on fire. Michael faces an agonizing, lifelong recovery from the burns. It started over a $40 dispute over a video game. Then there`s the hideous murder of 16-year-old Derrion Albert, stomped, pummeled to death in Chicago in broad daylight. An angry mob attacked him. You know, if these kids that are suspects in these cases had been going to group therapy from elementary school to middle school to high school, I personally don`t think these crimes would have ever happened. What are your thoughts? What does group therapy give the kids? KREVER: Well, what it really does is it allows them a vehicle or a venue to really observe healthy, positive relationships and understand what their role is in contributing or being a part of a positive. They constantly are barraged by negative messages and many of them, of our young people today, are involved in negative peer groups and not supported. How often do we have the opportunity to talk about what is a healthy relationship? And so, at Harvey Milk High School, or Hetrick-Martin Institute, they are able to really examine, what are the behaviors that make you feel safe, that let you know you`re in a loving relationship. And most importantly, how to take those relationships and replicate them in their lives. VELEZ-MITCHELL: Hang in there. Thank you so much. We`re going to continue to hear from you.

MAHER: And I -- that was Mark Wahlberg. I recognize him. So what is this movie about? You play a bear with Mark Wahlberg. MACFARLANE: Yes. It's sort of what happens after the Disney fairy tale is over. It's -- it begins in a very classic fairy tale fashion, where Mark as a young boy makes a wish that his favorite teddy bear would come alive and talk to him and magically it happens. And then the movie takes place three decades later, when he's now an adult. He's got a job. He's got a girlfriend and the bear is still with him and it gets high with him and drinks his beer and basically makes his life -- basically keeps him in adolescence.

But not everybody around here is hopping on the bandwagon just yet. He hasn't been commander in chief for the full year, but the rush is already on here in his home state to name slices of Hawaii after him, including Magic Island a beach where the future president used to body surf. MAYOR MUFI HANNEMANN, HONOLULU: He went there as a youth with his family, and since he returned he likes to picnic there with his family.

Embassy officials say the entrance is blocked by hundreds of protesters that are clashing nearby. The clashes are not threatening. So, I want to repeat that. They are not threatening the U.S. embassy in Cairo. It is just closed right now. That's what they are telling us. The clashes are coming from massive demonstrations against President Morsy that have threatened the young, new government after a decree last week that extended his powers to a very uneasy level for many Egyptians. So, just -- they're saying to be cautious, you cannot get in or out of the U.S. embassy in Cairo right now. ROMANS: All right. The fiscal cliff in this country is just 33 days away.

196550,344359,CNN,CNN Live Today,"DARYN KAGAN, CNN ANCHOR: She has opened her eyes and moved her arms and legs. Mackayala Jefferson was found floating face down in the family's swimming pool in California. She was rushed to a hospital and doctors pronounced her dead, but 40 minutes later, a police detective noticed movement, and doctors revived the 20-month- old girl. I had a chance to talk to her doctor last night. Dr. James Cappon explains the long, difficult road ahead for this family. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAGAN: Doctor, let's start with an update on Mackayala's condition. DR. JAMES CAPPON, CRITICAL CARE SPECIALIST: Well, Mackayala today is in serious, but stable condition in the pediatric ICU at Children's Hospital of Orange County. KAGAN: I realize the story doesn't begin at this hospital. She was taken to another hospital where she was pronounced dead. But I think anybody following this little girl's story has to ask, how can this happen? What would possibly indicate with little Mackayala that she would appear dead when she was still alive? CAPPON: Well, it's a difficult question to answer, and it is what everybody wants to know. Our suspicion is that she was relatively protected and somehow blunted by a fairly low body temperature, and by the time she got to children's hospital, she had warmed up to a degree that we could more reliably assess what her overall condition, particularly neurological condition, was. KAGAN: You hear about children falling into cold water and surviving, but usually those are children you hear about in Minnesota, or Wisconsin, not Southern California. Could that water possibly have been cold enough? CAPPON: Oh, you're absolutely correct. And I don't want to have any sort of mistake made in that regard. This is very different from a pure ice water drowning situation that occurs in colder climates, in which you are basically instantly frozen. That can be very protective to your brain and allow you to get away with a long period of no oxygen or blood flow. This is different, and hence the prognosis is much more guarded and our uncertainty is quite significant. KAGAN: Let's talk about that prognosis. It is a miracle that Mackayala is here and she's alive, but What kind of future does she have? CAPPON: Well, she's already surprised us a great deal by, No. 1, her survival, as you mentioned. She's done some things in terms of overall progress in the last several days, including getting off the ventilator, that are not expected. She's done some neurological activities that, again, exceeded expectations. They would include breathing on her own, some movement of her arms and legs and even some eye opening. What we await and hope to see, but are not guaranteed is to see purposeful activities, activities that she is responding to making efforts in her own regard. KAGAN: And it's kind of hard right now to tell exactly where she is because she's been sedated? CAPPON: She has, although her improvements over the last several days,",0.0151558816097498,2003-11-13

So we move on to EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, who announced her resignation this week, along with White House press secretary Ari Fleischer. Donna, you've been to this revving up for an election. Is that what we are seeing now, not a house cleaning necessarily, but the exodus that always seems to precede an election campaign? BRAZILE: Well, I think, first of all, this is a rite of passage in all the administrations to get out while the going is good, and for this administration, I would get rid of my domestic team before the election, because they haven't done a pretty -- they haven't done a good job in solving a lot of problems. So, go home, Ari, go home, Christine, because the best is yet to come. GEORGE: Actually, Ari has done a fine job in terms of representing the ... BRAZILE: Lying? GEORGE: Oh, come on. In terms of representing the... BRAZILE: Double speak? GEORGE: Excuse me. With people like Michael McCurry in the previous administration? But no, but I mean, Christy Todd Whitman, though, she was -- I think was a bad pick from the beginning, because she's in a completely different ideological level in terms of reforming environmental laws than the rest of the Bush administration. FRANKEN: Oh, there is a consensus that it was not a very good fit. And it never was. BEINART: I think this administration is very shrewd, actually. I think one of the things they realized with someone like Whitman, is that it doesn't really matter for this administration who you have in a top job like that, because decisions are made out of the White House. So you might as well put on someone who has a fairly moderate face, because they are not going to make policy anyway. FRANKEN: Let me just move along a little bit here, because I want to talk about as we're getting to the election, the issues that are coming up, and there are expectations that national security, of course, will be a key issue in the next campaign. In a memo to fellow Democrats, political strategists Bob Shrum, James Carville and Stanley Greenberg said the party is going to have to change its image on national security issues. The memo said in part, ""what Democrats can and must show is a firm commitment to keeping America safe from attack. This is not about faulting President Bush. This is about being part of a unified effort in the country to achieve greater security."" Well, the question, I guess is, how uphill is it for the Democrats, for the Democrats to get unified on anything, particularly national security? GOLDBERG: Well, if you look at the primaries in the base in the Democratic Party today, it's going to be very difficult for that kind of message to get out there, when right now the only applause lines you hear are from people like Dennis Kucinich and from Howard Dean",0.3290984492354244,2003-05-25

And so it would be foolish for them to allow their client to go into court and plead guilty to something that they haven't even really established yet. And so his confession, which we don't know how it was taken, it could have been lawful, maybe unlawful, but the evidence would have to be supported by his confession. So we don't know how they found the bodies. It wasn't too far off from where they lived, but that confession alone isn't enough for prosecutors to the convict him for first degree murder. They have to have some corroborating evidence. PAUL: I think what has been really tough to take in here, a lot of people thought about Scott Peterson. TEWOLDE: Yes. PAUL: And the case where he killed his wife, Laci, who was pregnant, but this is also a man who allegedly killed two of his children. What is his defense? I don't -- I mean accident certainly couldn't be part of this, yes? TEWOLDE: That would -- that would be -- that would be a stretch. Most defense attorneys would argue that he accidentally killed, say, one people, but we have three here. PAUL: Yes. TEWOLDE: So how do you accidentally kill three people? So that would be a stretch. The only other defense that they could possibly use would be insanity. PAUL: And what would they have to prove to do that? I mean what if there's some sort of premeditation? Because he came out the day -- the next day seeming calm. How does that, by the way, and how does that play into his interview the next day, begging for them to come back? How does that play into this? TEWOLDE: It demonstrates how cold, callus and calculated he is. Eerily similar to Drew and Scott Peterson. Prosecutors can use that to paint this picture of this person who isn't someone you should even feel any type of remorse for, but that he calculated these murders of his wife and children. And so it doesn't make him look good. But in order to support a plea or a defense for insanity, he would have to prove that he wasn't in his right state of mind at the time. But his actions afterwards say so much and speak so much to his mental state and where he was at and that he was also charged with tampering with evidence in that he was moving the bodies. He knew that police would be searching for their bodies and he calculated that and he moved them so that they weren't found. And so that also plays a role.

And it stems from all the fallacies that were printed about Sharon in the press right after the murders and one that sticks in my mind is ""Live freaky, die freaky,"" as if these people brought these murders on themselves. And this is a result of some things that can happen when someone else is blamed for their own murder. Even after the Manson family was caught, the owner of the house continued the lawsuit against the Tate family. GRACE: Alisa Statman, author of ""Restless Souls."" I want to go now to special guest, Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Manson. He is the author of ""Helter Skelter."" Vincent, thank you for being with us. Vincent, what do you make of Charles Manson being interviewed by ""Vanity Fair"" and giving all his thoughts on politics? VINCENT BUGLIOSI, PROSECUTED MANSON CASE: Well, they`re completely irrelevant. He`s become so notorious that we don`t draw the line on people who are notorious, even if it`s deep in infamy and say we`re not going to talk to you because you`re a bad person so that doesn`t surprise me at all. GRACE: But what`s also burning me up -- I want to throw this in addition to Bugliosi. I want to throw this out to you, Alisa, the fact that Charles Manson has a Web site, he`s got thousands of Twitter followers, they send him money behind bars, so he can get his Doritos out of the vending machine and other perks? Why? STATMAN: You know, he`s got a continued following. He`s able to get cell phones in prison. They`re smuggled in to him. It`s been an ongoing problem in the prison systems in California. And it`s unbelievable to me that anyone would support him, but they do. His Web site sells his artwork, artwork that, I might, that has the victim`s bodies embedded in them. It`s almost a slap in the face -- it`s a complete slap in the face to the victims that he`s done. (CROSSTALK) STATMAN: But he`s mocking the people -- GRACE: Hold on.

Also sources say, Cohen gave new documents to the committee, edited versions of false statements he gave to Congress back in 2017, but he says the edits weren't his. Now to help unpack all of this, we have this report by our senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) JOE JOHNS, SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, CNN (voice over): New questions about Michael Cohen's congressional testimony coming after a second closed-door hearing before the House Intelligence Committee. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER LAWYER FOR DONALD TRUMP: I believe they're happy. I'm here to cooperate and will continue to cooperate. (END VIDEO CLIP) JOHNS (voice over): ""The Washington Post"" reporting that Cohen told the committee he discussed a pardon with President Trump's lawyers, Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani. But the details of that conversation remain unclear. Sekulow flatly denying that the discussion occurred. ""The Wall Street Journal"" reports that after the FBI raided Cohen's properties last year, he directed his attorney to explore possibilities of a pardon with Giuliani and the President's other lawyers. Giuliani telling CNN that he never offered anyone a pardon. Both reports raising questions about whether Cohen misled Congress in public testimony last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COHEN: I have never asked for, nor would I accept a pardon from President Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP) JOHNS (voice over): Lanny Davis insisting to CNN that his comment does not contradict Cohen's testimony, saying Cohen directed his attorney to discuss a pardon with Mr. Trump's attorneys when they were in a joint defense agreement. Davis claims that Cohen was referring to the period after the collapse of that agreement during last week's testimony. Multiple sources tell CNN that Cohen also provided the committee with documents showing edits to the false written statement he delivered to Congress in 2017 about the timing of negotiations over the Trump Tower Moscow project. Last week Cohen testified that Mr. Trump's lawyer made changes to the statement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COHEN: There were several changes that were made, including how we were going to handle that message. Which was -- REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-MD), CHAIRMAN, OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Were you finished? COHEN: Yes, the message, of course, being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive. (END VIDEO CLIP) JOHNS (voice over): Davis tells CNN that Cohen authored the line lying about when discussions of the project ended, but a key question remains whether any of the lawyers who signed off on the statement knew it was false. (END VIDEO TAPE) JOHNS (on camera): So these allegations about the dangling of a pardon are potentially explosive in the United States because, here the definition of political corruption is essentially the offering of a thing of value in exchange for an official act, like a pardon. So it's really a question of who said what and when, what was their intent, and what's the proof -- Kristie. LU STOUT: Yes, and that's",0.6578469225528049,2019-03-07

That's not going to play out mere with Republicans or Democrats. And are you for the environment or not? And Al Gore gets very good marks, and George Bush does not. Campaign finance reform, in my judgment, is only meaningful to people when you connect it to an issue they care about. MATALIN: All right, governor, we're going to get to those other issues, but this is because of the McCain insurgency, and both of the candidates raising last night this issue. It is a top priority. And the vice president came right at Governor Bush this morning, also suggested that those commercials that were run in New York, these independent expenditure ads, were awful. He's going to ban those, too. But of course these same kind of independent expenditure groups are running millions of dollars of ads against George Bush in New Hampshire -- NARAL, and Americans -- whatever your other liberal groups are called -- the Sierra Club. Is he suggesting that the liberal independent expenditure groups also be banned from the general election? DAVIS: Well, again, Mary, if the candidates can agree on some rules that they both think will allow them to communicate their message, that is fine with me. But poll after poll has convinced me that Americans don't really think campaign reform is their highest issue. Yes, if campaign reform is stopping us from getting sensible gun control, fine, but John McCain is against that and so is George Bush. It only matters to people if money is keeping the Congress from doing what America wants. PRESS: Governor Pataki, it was a big victory for Governor Bush yesterday, but I want to show you a couple of numbers out of California that suggest maybe there's less there than meets the eye. And you know, the California primary was the first time in an open primary that it was Bush versus Gore, sort of an early test of what could happen in November. Let's look first at moderates. Clearly, Governor Bush wins among conservatives. But among moderates, Al Gore, 39 percent; George Bush, 20 percent. So I mean, this was a guy, a candidate, governor, who was sold as somebody having broad appeal. He hasn't shown that yet in one primary. PATAKI: Well, Bill... PRESS: Doesn't that trouble you? PATAKI: No, because, Bill, he has shown it as governor of Texas. You take a look at Al Gore. Al Gore's never run anything except when maybe he was involved in starting the Internet. Apart from that, he hasn't any executive experience at all. And take a look at Governor Bush. He's been a successful executive. He's run a diverse and large state exceptionally well.

So, Paula, Djokovic's parents are now saying he's being held captive, but the Australians say he can leave any time he wants? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Alison. We're really hearing some very emotive language coming from the family and also the supporters of Novak Djokovic. We are hearing from his father, his mother as well saying that he is being held captive. That he is a prisoner. His father going further saying that it is a persecution of Serbia as well saying that Novak is Serbia, Serbia is Novak. Saying it is politically biased. But what we've heard from the Home Affairs minister is that Novak Djokovic can actually leave any time he wants. She said, he is free to leave at any time that he chooses to do so. He is not being held captive. In fact, the border police will actually facilitate that. Meaning that they will help to deport him, pointing out that anybody coming into Australia does need to have the correct documentation, otherwise, this is what will happen. And we are seeing this really go to the highest levels. You are hearing from the Australian prime minister. You are hearing from the Serbian president. You are hearing emotive language from the families and the supporters. And then it is very polarizing. You are also hearing criticism from someone on the ground in Australia, especially Melbourne, which has been through some very lengthy lockdowns and pointing out that others are suffering from more. Also hearing from those who are supporting other people in detention in that same facility that Djokovic is in, some of which asylum seekers, refugees have been there for years. Now also, an interesting development. We are hearing from the Australia border force about two other players that we heard about. They say that one has had their visa canceled. We are hearing from the Czech foreign ministry that that is actually Renata Voracova. She's a Wimbledon doubles semifinalist. She is in detention just like Djokovic at this point. We understand from the foreign ministry, they say that she is probably going to leave voluntarily as her visa has been canceled. That she is not going to fight it because of issues with not being able to train at all. And there is also another individual that has already left Australia at this point. So, it just shows that this is not just Novak Djokovic.

FRAZIER: It's 11:00 a.m. in Cozumel, Mexico, midnight in Beijing. Hello and welcome to our report that's broadcast around the globe. I'm Stephen Frazier. GORANI: I'm Hala Gorani. From Tokyo to Toronto, Houston to Hong Kong, wherever you're watching, this is YOUR WORLD TODAY. Well, already considered extremely dangerous, Hurricane Dean is picking up strength and speed as it churns towards some of the Caribbean's busiest beaches. FRAZIER: It's a Category 4 storm, approaching Category 5, and it is approaching Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula after giving Jamaica and the Caymans quite a pounding. GORANI: Now, Dean's fiercest winds blew just south of Jamaica, but the hurricane still battered the island with driving rain, knocking down power lines and leaving streets littered with smashed roots and trees. FRAZIER: So far, no casualties are reported. There's some injuries, perhaps, but the storm is blamed for at least seven deaths elsewhere in the Caribbean. GORANI: Well, right now, Dean is southwest of the Cayman Islands, sparing them the worst of its 240-kilometer-an-hour winds. That's about 150 miles an hour. It's expected to grow into a monstrous Category 5 hurricane before making landfall near Cancun and cozumel. Tens of thousands of tourists in Mexico aren't waiting around. Not taking any chances to see whether Dean crashes ashore or not. They're mobbing airports for the last flights out, while many locals are heading for higher ground. Let's get an update from Cancun and our Rob Marciano. Rob, give us the situation now where you are on the ground. ROB MARCIANO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Well, the weather's all right, Hala, at least for now. The winds have been picking up, but as you can tell, the sun is still out. So, the weather has far from deteriorated, but the winds are picking up, and so the waves are rolling in a little bit more and the water is coming up. I mean, normal high tide is -- well, it's very close to where I'm standing. The problem with Cancun, if you haven't been here, is this entire stretch of beach for miles is lined with hotel after hotel. Here comes the high tide right here, right up to my feet, almost up to the seawall right here. OK? So, if you can imagine how high the water is getting right now, the sun's out, the winds maybe 20 miles an hour -- or, you know, think about just how far this water's going to get up later on tonight, when the high tide comes and the surge really begins to press on.

POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: OK, Leyla, thank you for the reporting and the big picture analysis. Appreciate it very much. Top of the hour, good morning everyone. I'm Poppy Harlow. Jim Sciutto has a well deserved day off. And President Trump is firing back this morning after Mitt Romney writes a scathing op-ed. The incoming senator slammed the president's character saying he has not, quote, ""risen to the mantle of the office."" More on this growing clash between Republican incoming senator and the Republican president in a moment. But it is day 12 -- morning 12 of the government shutdown and the president is just hours away from two key meetings, one with his cabinet officials, the other a high stakes meeting with congressional leaders of both parties will take place in the situation room. Can they hash out any sort of a deal? Let's go to the White House and begin with Boris Sanchez this morning. The meeting with congressional leaders in the situation room. Why? BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Poppy. We actually just learned the time for this meeting is set for 3 p.m. The White House confirming that. It is notable that this meeting is taking place in the situation room, an area of the White House that's typically reserved monitoring international crisis and military operations overseas. It sort of underscores how this administration feels about the issue of immigration and how perhaps the president feels about immigrants, noting that he's repeatedly called them invaders right before the midterm elections. We should point out the last time that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were here at the white House, things did not go well. They spent about 40 minutes to an hour arguing, not showing any sign of budging on their positions over the government shutdown because of President Trump's demand for border wall funding. This time it's unlikely that cameras will be there to capture the scene, but based on statements that we've seen from both sides already, there likely will be fireworks. Here is a statement from Nancy Pelosi, a tweet that she out regarding this bipartisan package of bills that Democrats are expected to vote on in the House tomorrow. She writes, quote, ""Donald Trump has given Democrats a great opportunity to show how we will govern responsibly and quickly pass our plan to end the irresponsible Trump shutdown, just the first sign of things to come in our new Democratic majority committed to working for the people.""

834010,1108684,CNN,American Morning,"35 minutes after the hour. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING) ROBERTS: Thirty-nine minutes now after the hour. A top-secret intel community is growing out of control, too big to fit into 22 U.S. capitals or almost three Pentagons. That's what a two-year-long ""Washington Post"" investigation into the post-9/11 world has uncovered and no one knows how much it's costing or whether it's even working. CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend was homeland security advisor to President Bush. She worked in the Justice Department during the Clinton administration and she is now a member of the CIA's external advisory board. Fran, good to see you this morning. So, this three-part series in ""The Washington Post,"" much anticipated -- as we said, two years in the making. How's the administration -- how's the intelligence community feeling about this report coming out now? FRAN TOWNSEND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR: You know, John, this has been sort of an open secret in Washington. Remember, the executive branch of government, the intelligence community in particular, doesn't get their money on their own. It's appropriated by Congress. And so, you know, there are many people here in Washington who understood very well the growth of the intelligence community. Let's remember, you know, after the end of the Cold War, the intelligence community budget had been sharply reduced. They had lost people. They were understaffed. And so, 9/11 happens and there's this influx of money. Well, much of that money, particularly in the counterterrorism community, is one-year money because it's done by what's called supplemental. That means it's not in the regular budget. And so, how do you spend that money, how do you get the capability quickly? You hire contractors. And that's really what the article is about. ROBERTS: You know, it's one thing to grow the intelligence community, but then it's another thing to make sure that it's all functioning well together. And one of the findings of this ""Washington Post"" article, if we can quote it, it's quote -- it says, ""No one knows how much money it costs, how many people it employs, how many programs exist within it or exactly how many agencies do the same work."" There's a suggestion here that this may have grown out of control, has it? TOWNSEND: Well, I don't think it's fair to say it's grown out of control. I do think what you see is there are pockets of excellence around the intelligence community. Unfortunately, as we've seen, whether it's the Christmas Day attempted bombing or the Fort Hood shooting, they're not all talking to one another. They're not all sharing the information. Do they have the actual knowledge we need them to have to prevent these things? And that's a right concern. But again, that's why the government established the director of national intelligence. That's really the job of the director to manage the enterprise that has become our intelligence community. ROBERTS: OK. You mention the Fort Hood shooter, the Christmas Day bomber.

1681830,1997339,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"you agree with him that comments about the judiciary, criticism about specific judges, if you agree, if demoralizing and disheartening? THUNE: Well, I think, John, that that -- those comments demonstrate that this is an independent judge and why it's important that we go about the process of confirming him. He clearly is somebody who has great respect for the court, great respect for the rule of law, someone who has been universally respected on both sides of the political aisle and has issued opinions as a judge on the Tenth Circuit that have drawn not only a lot of attention but a lot of praise. I think this is somebody who ought to be able to go through a process, get fair consideration, obviously answer hard questions, but at the end of the day get an up and down vote. And I think the statements that he's making demonstrate to me his independence and his ability to judge with impartiality and to call balls and strikes, which is what I think most Americans look for when they think about the Supreme Court. HARLOW: Some also see, Senator, Judge Gorsuch's willingness to go into these meetings with Republicans and Democrats lawmakers on the Hill this week, and say these things, alluding to the president's comments and call it disheartening, et cetera, and demoralizing to talk about the judiciary in that way. They see that as a play -- a very smart political tactic on his part to get the eight votes that he needs to get to 60 -- a Democrat he needs to get to 60 votes in the Senate for confirmation. But some are criticizing the fact that he's not willing to come out and say that publicly. How do you see that? THUNE: I think that he'll get that opportunity when he testifies in front of the Judiciary Committee here in the Senate and goes through the confirmation process. He'll get lots of questions. I'm sure many questions perhaps on this very issue. So he'll have a chance to answer on the record most of these meetings that he has with members of Congress. I think are by and large tend to be sort of private meetings, although this is obviously something that got leaked out into the public domain. And again, I think what it represents, however, is in these meetings that he's having with members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, he has been willing to express an independence and that's something we're all looking for. When it comes to the judiciary and our constitutional democracy, an independent judiciary is absolutely foundational to our success. And I frankly like the fact that the judge is speaking his mind.

But, Don, significantly, this is the latest in a string of establishment moderate victories in these primaries across the country. You saw it in the New York mayor's race. You saw it in the Virginia governor's race. So certainly, this will take the wind out of the sails of the progressive movement that is trying to be more ascendant here.

CHARLES COLEMAN JR, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, I think that this may be a surprise to many people's sensibilities but it should not be a surprise to your logic. And what I mean by that is, trials, Ana, are oftentimes a tale of competing narratives. And I oftentimes say that the important piece is to control the narrative, whatever side you're on. And in this case, what we saw were the competing narratives of Kyle Rittenhouse, on one hand, being a victim and, on one hand, being a vigilante. And ultimately, what we know now is that the jury bought the narrative of Kyle Rittenhouse being a victim. They thought that his self-defense claim was a lot stronger than the prosecution's provocation claim. I think that there were a lot of other things that took place during the course of this trial that didn't necessarily put the prosecution in the best of light. But let's be clear about something. This was not a slam dunk from the prosecution from the get-go. They had an uphill battle to climb. The judge in this case did not do them any favors with many of his rulings, from the very beginning, all the way through the entirety of the case. However, it should be noted that the prosecution did not have great facts to work with from the outset. And so while a lot of people out there may be looking at this case and wondering, how could this have happened, if, as the last guest said, they were watching the trial and paying attention to the details, you may have seen some of this coming. At least an acquittal on -- of the charges, if not all of them, as we've seen here today. CABRERA: There were lesser charges they could have considered, Charles, and so we never heard a verdict on those lesser charges for the most serious counts. Is that typical that they wouldn't address those at all? COLEMAN: It is typical in that they looked at the top counts, they looked at the more serious counts, and they decided that those were not things they were going to entertain. So what it came down to -- the jury gets a verdict sheet and the verdict sheet has what the final charges are. And there were those charges that were read to the jury that -- that were read to the public that the jury ultimately voted on and decided on. And so they basically threw those out. And at this point, we're looking at Kyle Rittenhouse as a freeman. I think it's important to understand that regardless of the outcome of this case, in some eyes, Kyle Rittenhouse was going to be a hero and, in some eyes, he was going to be a villain.

They will tell you that there are still explosions we hear in the distance. Whether that's more Iron Dome interceptions or rockets hitting the ground, we have yet to find out. But there is still explosions that we're hearing in the distance. At least a half a dozen or so in the last few minutes. On top of that, we've heard drones flying all night, long before we got the heads up from the IDF that rockets had been fired at the Golan Heights. We've been hearing these drones, perhaps surveillance drones, flying over the area. Let me reiterate, about an hour ago, the Israeli military says 20 rockets were fired at Golan Heights. Iron Dome intercepted a number of those. So far, the IDF, Israeli military, says damage is limited, and there has been no casualties. But that continues to point and that is obvious, again, Wolf, because these explosions in the distance. So whatever attack was coming seems to be ongoing at this point. In terms of an Israeli military response, the IDF says they have responded but have not been more specific about the form of the response, number of strikes in that response, or the target to that response. That information will be coming at some point this evening. But so far, as Barbara mentioned, and as we're hearing right now, more than 20 rockets have been fired from the Quds force, the militant section of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, at Israel. A number of those rockets have been intercepted. And we continue to hear these explosions every few minutes or so. Perhaps Iron Dome interceptions of more rockets or more rockets themselves landing in Golan Heights. We'll get that information to you as soon as possible. But whatever has started here about an hour ago continues at this point. Wolf, we'll get you more information as soon as we can. BLITZER: Very quickly, Oren, I know you're -- I'm now told you're on the Golan Heights yourself. Usually, when Israel detects rockets coming in from across the border, sirens are going off, warning people to go into shelters. Has that happened based on what you've seen? LIEBERMANN: There's been warning. Rockets have come over. We're used to having a red alert when the rockets are going off. We have gotten that alert. We spoke with the Israeli military, because they have not issued instructions to head to bomb shelters. But we know yesterday the Israeli military was on high alert, and bomb shelters were open. In that sense, this is a response that Israel very much expected. It was also a reported strike near Damascus that Syria has attributed to the Israeli air force for the retaliation from not only from that recent strike but also from other recent strikes in Syria that Iran and Syria have blamed on Israel.

That he was in a kind of centrist position\nand that his problem wasn\'t with the immunity for telecoms companies, his problem was with court oversight of the program.\nAnd once that box was checked, he was OK with it.\n \n\n It is a compromise.

They`ve been taken away, as of right now, Tamara, but here`s the kicker. I hope you`re sitting down, Tamara in Pennsylvania, because, as I recall, there have been five -- repeat, one, two, three, four, five -- investigations by child protective services of this family and the children were still in the home. So, Michael Bored, why were they still in the home? BORED: Good question. A lot of us want the answer to that question. We`ve had a lot of problem here in Texas with an overburdened child protective services system. It`s been a big problem across the state. They`ve done a whole overhaul of the CPS system here in Texas, because the workers came out and said, ""Look, we just can`t cover all of the cases that we have.: BORED: You know, Estella Olguin is with us. Estella, thank you so much for being with us. She`s with child protective services there in Houston. I know that everyone is overloaded, but five investigations in the last few years and the children are still in the home. Why would they still be in the home? ESTELLA OLGUIN, CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES: Well, actually, we had three investigations, and the last one being in 2005. And the children were placed with the grandmother who, at the time, assured us that the mother would not be returning back to take the children. What happened in the last few years, it looked like mother had an additional five children and she and her boyfriend, Emanuel, and all the children and grandma then lived together in this one-bedroom apartment. GRACE: Well, if you gave the children to the grandmother, isn`t the grandmother living there in the home with the parents who are using cocaine? OLGUIN: Right, it looks like not only were they returned back to the home by the grandmother, but she might have been aware that the children were exposed to the parents` activities. GRACE: You know, according to our research, there has been an investigation by child protective services ongoing since 2002, February 2002. Months later, the mom giving inappropriate food to the same baby; 2005, Melton allegedly used cocaine to induce labor; 2005, December, is when the grandmother said she would care for the children; 2007, found out about children living in roach-infested apartment. We have another example in 2005 where the mom lost the kids for a while, given to the grandmother. It doesn`t make sense that the grandmother lived there. That equals five. Then the 11-month-old ends up in the hospital. But now, in the nick of time, thank God, child services has taken the children away. I want to go back out to our lawyers, Rikki Klieman and Daniel Horowitz. This is a tragedy waiting to happen. Now, all these children are going to be broken up, Daniel Horowitz.

Joining me now for the entire broadcast, CNN international anchor, Hala Gorani, who is in Washington tonight. Again, we welcome viewers from around the world. We want to go to Baghdad now, which was the beginning and the center of this conflict in the beginning. CNN's Arwa Damon has reported extensively from Baghdad throughout the war. We've been talking about the more than 100,000 Iraqi civilian casualties and millions more who have been displaced bid this war -- Arwa? ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And, of course, Don, there are the tens of thousands if not even more who have been wounded, many of them amputees, many of whose lives will literally never be the same. Don, you would be hard pressed to finds a family in Iraq that has not lost a loved one or directly suffered the consequences of this war. Many Iraqis at this stage as the U.S. is preparing to fully withdraw incredibly frustrated, disappointed and to a certain degree angry with the United States because of all of the mistakes that have been made here because they feel as if they are the ones that ultimately paid the cost. They look back at the nation that the U.S. is leaving behind, and despite what we are hearing from the Obama administration, from Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, this is very much a smattered nation. This government, many people will tell you, is not one of national unity. They still do not have security and stability in the way anyone would want to have it. There are still deaths that take place here on a daily basis. Basic services still in shambles. Nine years on, many Iraqis don't understand how it is they only still have two hours of city power a day -- Don? LEMON: And, Hala, you've seen it firsthand yourself. GORANI: The infrastructure in the country when I was there was, in some cases, absolutely disastrous. You were lucky if you were an ordinary Iraqi to get electricity more than a few hours a day. But to the present day, I wanted to ask Arwa a question there, as she's been covering the last few days. This political crisis that's unfolding, here you have Nouri al Maliki, the prime minister, rumors flying around that the Sunni vice president, Tariq al Hashimi, is about to be arrested. That prompts the mainly Sunni block, Iraqiya, to walk out of parliament and threaten to suspend their participation from the government. I mean, this looks like a very difficult, to say the least, situation politically for Iraq. And, Hala, what it also looks like is this so-called unity government is unraveling before the last American soldier has left Iraqi soil.

And we'll be spared that at least. But nonetheless, this is wrong. And if we're going to heal the country, we have to -- Trump has to play a part in that, in bringing his base around and to say we're going to be part of the normal politics and when we lose, we lose. But we'll try to take it back next time. I just -- it would be so much better for the country, I think this is -- you know, he's just so insulting in so many ways, such a crybaby, it's just disgusting. SCIUTTO: Let me ask you about the real security implications here. I've been speaking to folks in law enforcement and national security. Following Wednesday, they are deeply concerned about a repeat on Inauguration Day, that many of these same violent people will return and that's one of the reasons why we're seeing the deployment of National Guardsmen by a factor of six. Their presence in D.C. sextupled yesterday as a security precaution, they've ringed the Capitol building with this much higher fencing, similar to what you have around the White House right now. By not attending, is the president further fueling folks like that, not just to not accept his loss, but to protest on that day? GERGEN: That's an interesting question. I'm not so sure about that. My hope would be -- of course, hoping anything for Trump (ph) to do that's decent usually is in vain, but -- my hope would be that he would tell his followers to stay home, that he's going to -- he's not going to be there, they shouldn't be there. And I think that would -- I think it would be -- it would lessen these concerns. I must say, Jim, I think we're going to be in a period for months to come when higher security alerts are going to be prevailing all over Washington. It's just -- don't you feel that, it's in the air, there's just a sense here, and I -- SCIUTTO: Well -- GERGEN: -- I've heard a couple of stories over the last -- just the last couple days about the security, you know, security concerns were skyrocketing. SCIUTTO: Yes. It's not just a feel, David, I will tell you, that very risk has been mentioned to me, because these groups have not disappeared. And, by the way, dozens -- GERGEN: Yes. SCIUTTO: -- hundreds of them who were in that building, the Capitol, are still out and free. And I saw some of them wandering around the Hill yesterday, when I was up there.

2673,2849,CNN International,Inside Politics,"UNITED STATES: What did the Democratic governor of Massachusetts think he was doing when he let convicted first-degree murderers out on weekend passes? (END VIDEO CLIP) SESNO: An independent group, not connected to the Bush campaign, then produced one of the most notorious attack ads ever. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, NATIONAL SECURITY PAC AD) COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCER: He allowed first-degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison. One was Willie Horton, who murdered a boy in a robbery stabbing him 19 times. (END VIDEO CLIP) SESNO: The Bush campaign produced its own controversial ads on the issue. Although Bush never used Horton's picture or name, he was accused of exploiting race for political gain. So why is Bradley attempting to connect Gore to the Horton affair now? Well, Bradley has been getting tougher and more personal, as the first caucuses and primaries are just weeks away. The two Democrats are in a tough fight for the important African-American vote. Bradley has made racial harmony a central plank of his campaign, and yet polls continue to show blacks are among Al Gore's most loyal supporters. (END VIDEOTAPE) SESNO: A surprising development indeed. So let's talk more about Bradley's new line of attack against Gore. CNN's Jonathan Karl, who has been covering Bradley on the trail. He joins us from Manchester, New Hampshire. Also with us, CNN White House correspondent Chris Black, who covered the 1988 presidential campaign and the Willie Horton controversy. Jonathan Karl, first to you. What is the explanation from the Bradley camp as to all this? JONATHAN KARL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, Bradley's people are saying that he was answering a very specific question with an honest, candid response. They say this was not a plan to go out and bring up the Willie Horton issue or to go after Gore on the issue of race. But they are not backing away in any way. In fact, what the Bradley people are saying is that, although Gore never mentioned Willie Horton by name, the whole controversy about that furlough program was a controversy about Willie Horton. And they said that mentioning the furlough program was simply code for mentioning Horton. SESNO: Jonathan, some observers saying this undermines Bradley's claim to the high road in this campaign. KARL: Well, it is interesting, the Gore people are publicly coming out, acting very indignant about this, saying this was an unfair attack by Bill Bradley. But one senior Gore adviser told me, quote, ""they are doing high-fives at Gore headquarters."" They are ecstatic about this. Because what they say is that Bradley's number- one strength is that he is seen as above the fray, not a traditional politician. And every time he goes out and attacks, he is brought down, and looks like a traditional politician. SESNO: Chris Black, you recall this event very well, this Willie Horton business. What could the motivations be behind this? CHRIS BLACK, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Whose motivation, Frank, Bradley's? SESNO: Yes. BLACK: Well, it",0.3678969890163196,2000-01-13

If I could get back to some of the things that Chris was saying\nabout manufacturing and creating jobs and building stuff in this country; to be fair about it, as much of an advocate as I\nam for labor and a believer in organized working in this country, it has been a rough night at the office. You know, they\ndidn`t deliver in Pennsylvania for Joe Sestak. They didn`t deliver for the gubernatorial chair in Ohio. Russ Feingold is\ngone. Barbara Boxer is back. Harry Reid is here. But this was not the sweeping victory that labor had in 2006 and in 2008\nfor Barack Obama. And so this is, I think, an opportunity for the Republicans. I would probably go with the most anti-labor\nguy I could find if I were on the Republican side. And that would take you right across the river from where you`re broadcasting\ntonight. Mr. Christie. This guy is an anti-labor guy. He`s a budget cutter. He will fall right in line with I think what\nBoehner is talking about and Cantor earlier tonight. And I also think that Michele Bachmann, who by the way -- earlier tonight,\nher victory party wasn`t even in her district. It was over in the Third District. So she talks about creating a jobs. Maybe\nshe ought to create jobs in the service industry in her own district and have her victory party in the Sixth District. It\nwas held over in the Third District. So -- and I think Bachmann going out and raising 11 million dollars, she is a national\nplayer. She has never seen a TV camera she didn`t like. She is very accessible to the folks across the street. And I think\nChristie. I think Bachmann. They`re media stars. They can raise a lot of money. They`re anti-labor. I think they are going\nto be players in 2012. Michele Bachmann, this is a big win for her. She doesn`t spend a lot of time in Minnesota. She has\ngone around the country. She stumped probably more than anybody else in the House for the Republican. She was everywhere.\nTerrell Clark put up a great fight. She was outgunned by seven million dollars. But she still lost by 12 percent of the vote.\n So I think Christie. I think Bachmann. They`re still fresh copy for the Republicans.

When you want something so bad and\nyou achieve it, you get overcome with emotion. He showed that he has a pulse. But again, Boehner is going to have to come\nback and he is going to have to work with the president to create jobs.

How do you think they're going to play for Donald Trump? HENDERSON: You know, I think he's got the advantage. He's got the momentum. Republican women seem to like Donald Trump, maybe not as much as Republican men. But there hasn't been any polling to indicate so far that he has taken a hit among Republican women. So I think he's got ahead of steam going into Indiana, all the polling because he's got something of an edge but who knows now with Mike Pence coming out, we'll see how that plays. But listen, Donald Trump has been successful.

An Oklahoma court has now up held a ruling not to bring charges of forcible oral sodomy, that's what they call it in the statute, against a defendant citing the wording of the law.

A combination of people from neighboring Zhejiang province known for their liberally use of sugar, soy and vinegar, and from Jiangsu Province known for fresh ingredients and attention to preserving the aliveness of its dishes. It's the best of both of worlds, great sauces, great ingredients. There's hong shao rou, braised pork belly in a deep red braise of dark and light soy sauce, cinnamon, sugar, and anise.

Anyway -- BORGER: What about -- SANTORUM: It doesn't mean you're going to find it. BORGER: What about stopping the use of the automatic sorting machines, for example, which hurt mail delivery? I mean, look, if it is not political, it is incompetence, but something is wrong, and we all know that something is wrong. And by the way, something is wrong with the way these -- with the way votes have been counted. We need to know, we need to change, now that we've seen how many people voted in a pandemic and how it increased participation with having more people being able to vote by mail -- JONES: On both sides. BORGER: On both side, something has to be done. I know it was said 20 years ago after Bush/Gore, but something has to be done to make sure that it rises to the level of competency so American people can believe their votes count and are delivered. SANTORUM: And there's nothing blocking the states from doing that. Some states do, some states don't want to. BORGER: And I know people have looked into a federalized system. People have looked into a federalized system -- SANTORUM: No. BORGER: And it is not going to happen.

BORGER: So you have different states with different ways of counting ballots and one takes five days and one takes three days because of what the state legislatures have ordered.

It would be hard to screw them all up at the same time, which is actually a good thing. BORGER: Yeah. JONES: But there is a Voting Rights Act that has been shot down by the Supreme Court that John Lewis was beaten for and John Lewis tried to work for, and the Republicans, by the way, helped pass that thing. This was a bipartisan bill, one of the more bipartisan successes. The Supreme Court shot it down. There's an opportunity now for Republicans and Democrats to come together to get the Voting Rights Act done again to at least raise the floor.

But the wonderful thing about John is, it would pass, and eventually he would apologize, he'd come up and gruffly on the Senate floor say, I realized I kind of overdid it there. But you always knew, when he did get angry about something, that it was because he sincerely believed that you were wrong on an issue, and he was trying to straighten you out. So he did try to straighten me out, not successfully on that particular issue. But, over the years, we had a wonderful relationship. And he was a real mentor to me. I think this is a part of John McCain that a lot of people don't know about, is that he took younger senators under his wing. And, in my case, I -- he taught me so much about national security and foreign policy, even when we didn't always agree. He took me four times with him to Iraq and Afghanistan. I'll never forget the first trip to Iraq. It was the very early stages of the war. And we did a spiral landing at Bagram Air Base. I was absolutely terrified. And he was just chatting with Joe Lieberman, and he reached over and he said to me, ""Don't worry, Susan."" I remember so clearly now. ""I have been through so much. I'm going to die at home in my own bed."" And I couldn't help but think of that yesterday, that at least he was at his beloved Sedona. TAPPER: Yes, he would always say that he couldn't... COLLINS: And with his family. TAPPER: He couldn't be killed in a plane. He'd been through five plane crashes or something like that, including when he was shot down by the North Vietnamese. Obviously, the senator is going to be missed here in the United States, but he was also -- he was an international figure. He had taken the role recently of reassuring American allies amid the turbulence of the Trump administration. Allied countries such as Canada and Germany have expressed condolences, including this line from the German Embassy -- quote -- ""Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Senator John McCain, to the people of Arizona and America, whom he served so admirably. We remember him as a champion of the transatlantic alliance and a friend of Germany."" And that's a -- that's a really strong statement for an ally to make, a champion of the transatlantic alliance. Obviously, this comes when President Trump is not seen as such a champion. Do you think the global order is less secure without John McCain in the world?

The infrastructure is not there. So, you can see that what's going to happen here. There's going to be one challenge after another.

And once the shot pulls out, you can see just how damaging those floodwaters are, really causing some problems there. Also, we're getting reports from this affiliate that there had to be some rescues from rescue crews to get people out of their vehicles there. And you see that bubbling up. That is that water main break. Just moments ago, Ross Marroso, who's a WDIV chopper pilot, filed this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSS MARROSO, WDIV: A gentleman got rescued, I believe it was from this car, maybe about 15 minutes or so ago. And he was able to walk out with the emergency crews. They sort of waded themselves through. But now, as I've got time here, circling around for me. It's now starting to come over the hood of the car, so it is getting deeper. It's certainly not getting deeper at a rate of, you know, feet per minute or anything like that. But every 10, 20 minutes, it is getting a couple inches deeper. And when you consider that this is in an area that's not designed to hold water at all, and it really has rein to go as far down the freeway it wants, this really gives you an idea of how fast the water is coming out, that the water doesn't even have the time -- forget trying to drain for a moment, but trying to, you know, just spread out fast enough. And you can see the damage that it's starting to take here in the parking lots and around even places where the water has receded a bit or has changed its course. You can see the mud here in the center of my screen. That's what's been left from this. Imagine what I-96 now is going to look like when they actually get all the water drained off of this.

Sanjay Gupta again joins us from the area around Sendai. And I want to bring Jim Walsh, a CNN contributor as well. Want to focus now on this nuclear emergency that we are -- that we are facing in an area south of where Sendai is, an area called Fukushima, which is just a little bit south of where I am. We're kind of on the outskirts of it. That's where we flew into earlier today. The biggest plant of concern right now -- there are a number of nuclear facilities in that area but one is called the Fukushima Daiichi Plant. And Japanese officials believe that in at least two of the six reactors there may have been a partial meltdown. They are assuming there has been a partial meltdown -- I stress partial -- in two of the six reactors but they can't confirm that at this point because it is simply too hot inside those reactors for them to really check and they're taking the incredibly unusual step of actually pumping in seawater. So I want to bring in Jim and talk to him. Jim, explain what that means, a partial meltdown in two reactors. JIM WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, I know when people hear the world meltdown, Anderson, they get very panicky and they think about that -- you know they think about Chernobyl, they think about Three-Mile Island, but there's a continuum here. You can -- as you rightly point out -- have partial meltdowns. That's very different than the consequences you would have if you had a total meltdown. When you have a total meltdown, the fuel rods all catch fire, they overheat, they melt, they congregate at the bottom of the reactor vessel, and when they do that, they -- you get what's called a criticality accident, and you get something that explodes. And then the question is whether the containment vessel holds all that or whether it cracks and throws that radiation up into the sky. We are not there yet. That's very important to underline. COOPER: So, Jim -- WALSH: So we've had what appears -- COOPER: Jim, let me just jump in here. WALSH: Yes. COOPER: Let me just jump -- Jim, let me just jump in here. Just explain a couple of terms you're using because you're talking about a containment vessel and fuel rods. The fuel rods, that's the actual nuclear material? WALSH: Exactly. Those are the -- that's the nuclear material that they stick in to the plant that is the fuel for the plant. And by -- and then the containment vessel is something that they did not have at Chernobyl but that they do have here, which -- and the sole purpose of the containment vessel is, if there is a problem, if there is a meltdown, a full meltdown, the purpose of that containment",0.2067905589356312,2011-03-13

He's reading scholarly books not Italian vogue. Nevertheless, from European newspapers to a Catholic publication to ""Newsweek"", Pope Benedict's fashion sense is under the microscope.

MUSIC MOOS: We couldn't quite nail down whether Pope Benedict's shoes are absolutely positively Prada. The company couldn't confirm it. Other Vatican fashion rumors, likewise unconfirmed, have it that the pope is neglecting the tailor shop that's made papal garments for over 200 years, in favor of his own personal tailor. There were stories of a fashion faux pas when the new pope made his debut. GALLAGHER: His cassock was about that high, you know, his hemline was of the cassock was that high from his ankles.

Another story in the saga of ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Two of the child actors who were discovered in an Indian slum in Mumbai and shot to stardom in the film could lose the money they were promised by producers. Instead of a paycheck, a trust was set up for the kids and they get paid every month and they'll also get a lump sum when they finish school. But the trust says the kids' families are not holding up their end of the bargain. Our Sara Sidner is tracking the story. She's live in New Delhi for us this morning. So Sara, what's going on this time? SARA SIDNER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, there's been a lot of twists and turns in the lives of these children, more so than in the movie itself. This time, the trustees that we spoke with said that two of the child actors from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" are simply not attending school very often. He told us that Rubina Ali, who is 9, and Azharuddin Ismail, who is 11, are missing school about 60 percent of the time. Now, the trustee told us he believes that the reason for this is that the families are trying to cash in on their children's success right now instead of giving them an education and letting them attend school, and one of the fallouts from all this is that the trust is set up specifically that these kids must go to school about 70 percent of the time in order to get the monthly stipend that they get every month to help with their living expenses and the lump sum of money that they are supposed to get, which is supposed to be sizable, after they graduate.

181498,321519,CNN,CNN Live Sunday,"KELLI ARENA, CNN ANCHOR: Now, to the war in Iraq and emerging details about what was happening to undermine the government of Saddam Hussein long before the war began. Our Chris Plante is at the Pentagon. Chris, what can you tell us about the new information? CHRIS PLANTE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Kelli. Some more reporting on U.S. military and intelligence agency efforts prior to the war, working hand in hand with Iraqi exiles and ex-patriots in an effort to essentially infiltrate and destabilize the leadership of the Iraqi military. Now we all saw the images of the U.S. and British forces racing north toward Baghdad from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. And we saw that they met with relatively little resistance, considering the size of the Iraqi army. It's now become fairly clear that a big part of the reason for that was an effort made primarily by U.S. Special Operations Forces, to reach members, and in particular the leadership of Republican Guard units and other heavy armored units of the Iraqi military, and effectively, threaten them and explain to them their lives would be a lot better if they agreed to not come out and fight. Now, some of the Iraqi ex-patriots also worked inside of Iraq contacting directly some of these leaders, and explaining to them it would be to their benefit if they didn't come out when the allied forces moved north and fight. Now, clearly we saw that there was some resistance, particularly in the south, but that was largely coming from irregular forces, such as the Fedayeen, and non-uniformed forces. But armored division, which had taken up positions around Baghdad in particular, while they took heavy aerial bombardment, didn't come out and fight. The reason, it turns out, in large part is because these Special Operation Forces and intelligence units e-mailed directly the military leaders, and called them directly on the telephone, telling them quite explicitly to not come out and fight. So clearly this has had quite a profound effect and will likely go down in the history books as an innovative means of collapsing your enemy. Kelli? ARENA: ...some communication, but there are also reports that the military may have paid some of those leaders for their cooperation. Quickly, is that true? PLANTE: Well, there are reports that payments were made. I'm told that there were a limited number of payments made, but for the most part it was simply explained that if they didn't come out, they would not be killed, and that... (LAUGHTER) ARENA: That's a convincing argument. PLANTE: It generally is. And that, as one official said to me today, is sometimes better than money. Kelli. ARENA: All right, Chris. Thanks very much.

A lot of people here, you know, graduated high school and went to Bobcat and they've worked there their whole life. KING: The store is a leading indicator of the local economy. Sales slumped at rumors of Bobcat troubles. And even the plan to shift work here from Bismarck isn't enough to erase the anxiety. HINKEMEYER: The workers come in here and you can see it in their faces, if there has been talks of a layoff or talks of, you know, the company might not be staying around. I'm satisfied that they're really trying to stay here, but I think you feel from a lot of people, they're not sure yet. KING: At the moment, Corey Essig is on the upside of the recession roller coaster. COREY ESSIG, BOBCAT EMPLOYEE: Shovel that dirt back. KING: But his family's lesson in the difficult math of unemployment is still fresh, $351 a week was his benefit when Bobcat laid him off five months ago. (on camera): What was the worst of that? ESSIG: The worst of that? KING: Yes. ESSIG: I'd have to say, probably paying the insurance, health insurance because you need it and my son has a heart condition, so can't hardly go without it. I was paying $440 a month and then you have to start cutting back on stuff like your cell phone, your computer, you know, you have to look at shutting some of that stuff off. And you know, it's buying less food and you have two kids to support and a wife. And it gets pretty trying. KING (voice-over): But Bobcat just called Corey back to work in the paint room that requires a hooded safety suit. ESSIG: I think that things will straighten out here, be pretty steady with work now. I don't think -- foresee them moving the company, but you never know. KING: Rumors of moving or shutting down are often tied to Bobcat's purchase two years ago by a Korean company, but Goldsbury says the owners are proud of their American-made product and of the company's North Dakota roots. (on camera): And you have full confidence that if I come back in 10 years, this will be here? GOLDSBURY: Yes, I do. KING: No hesitation. GOLDSBURY: No hesitation. We've been here for 60 years. I don't see us going anyplace. This is where we came from. This is our bellwether plant. This is where we started the business.

I think it's becoming increasingly clear it may not be effective, no more effective than not giving the medication. So there's other trials being looked at and other medications. I'm optimistic that one of these medications will show some positive results because so many trials are going on. The Hydroxychloroquine has gotten a lot of attention thus far, at least so far I think the enthusiasm is starting to be significantly dampened by this trickle of evidence. COOPER: The president would say what do you got to lose. Clearly. in this case, again, if this study holds up, there's a lot to lose. GUPTA: Yes. Even if it didn't cause any benefit and didn't cause any harm, the idea that you need to be looking at these other medications and investing the same sort of time, attention, and resources toward these other medications, because you don't want to miss something that could potentially provide a lot of benefit so that is one of the concerns. That's why when we talk about it from scientific terms, you want to always be optimistic but you need to see the data. COOPER: Come Monday, in Georgia, where you live, people can go to movies and out to restaurants. If you decide to go to movies or for dinner, if you're sitting a few seats away from others, I mean, are you safe? We were showing this diagram which shows, I guess, the spread of coronavirus in a restaurant in China, one person which is the -- one person, who is the primary patient, then spread it to other people in the restaurant. GUPTA: Yes. There's one person at these three tables. It's the person in the table in the middle, a table. A1 is diagnosed with the disease and doesn't know it when he has a meal at this restaurant. He infects four people at the same table and two people in the table behind him and two people from the table across from him. COOPER: That is incredible. GUPTA: I found this -- yes. I found this to be quite storied. There was an air-conditioner, I guess, by table C. It was blowing air across. No one is suggesting this got into the air-conditioning system. Clearly. we are dealing with a really contagious virus. I think people should look at this because despite the fact that you can maybe go to restaurants starting Monday, I think a lot of public health officials think that is a bad idea, but despite the fact you can, doesn't mean you should. I certainly don't want to unnecessarily frighten people, but I think that imagine, which is on the CDC's Web site, Anderson, should be something that people look at and are reminded of as they go.

(on-camera) It's an odd feeling here in the parts of Aleppo occupied by the free Syrian army. People are out. They're buying vegetables, the bakeries are working, but all the while occasionally, you hear blasts like that as the area comes under bombardment. (voice-over) This man shows me his son, Mustafa, born 10 days ago to the sound of fighting. ""He cries and is terrified during the bombings. The bombardment appears to be random. I was told this house was hit in an air raid two days before killing two of its inhabitants. There are no rebel positions in the area."" Cut off from the rest of the city, Shikari (ph) residents have turned a public park into a temporary graveyard. Abu Hamud (ph), a fighter, explains that the latest grave contains three bodies no one could identify because they were so severely mutilated. The shelling goes through the night. The explosions and the uncertainty about where the next round will fall makes sleep difficult. Early in the morning, around 100 residents of Shikari (ph) line up for bread. This is the only bakery that makes bread in the area. Bread has become the main staple here. Each family member is allowed one flat loaf a day sold at a symbolic price. The flour is provided either by the free Syrian army or wealthy benefactors. Even if more food was available, cooking is a problem. This part of Aleppo has run out of cooking gas. Umad Nan (ph) explains she cooks for her extended family of 16 on firewood she collects in parks and in the street. And for the children, there's a sense of bewilderment as war turns their lives upside down. ""We're confused,"" says 11-year-old Nana (ph). We feel they want to attack us. We left this area before then we came back. Now, we want to leave again, but we can't.

But the truth of the matter is that this is piling up with fence-sitting evangelicals and what I mean by that is it ultimately those fence- sitting evangelicals are going to have to decide, do they want to support him again. And I'm not talking about the deplorable evangelicals as I like to call them, but the ones that he had it hello from the beginning. I'm talking about those ones that kind held their nose a little bit. COOPER: I think the point you're making is important one because it's very easy, I think, for people to paint evangelicals with a very broad brush and sort of think about evangelicals as this one block of people but obviously there are different philosophies in it, different outlooks, different points of view and it's interesting that you're kind of breaking it down to, you know, fence-sitters and people who are, you know, they had -- they were for Trump from the beginning. BRODY: Well, I think it's very dangerous, especially for the Trump administration, to think they just have all evangelicals, that those just be with them again. And, look, this administration has done a lot for evangelicals, I don't think there's any question about it. But you can't assume that the whole pie is going to be with you in 2020 for sure. Now, look, having said that, Anderson, I have to tell you that the folks that are on the fence, at least from an informal poll on Twitter but beyond that word on the evangelical street, the folks that I travel in basically say that they will still take actions over insults. COOPER: So bottom line, the kind of the point you've been making just in the last couple of days with some of the tweets you send is that the administration should not take evangelicals for granted that, you know, the percentage he got, there are a certain number, a certain percentage -- of the percentage who voted for him, the 81 or so percent of evangelicals who went to the polls who voted for Trump, some of them are what you say are fence-sitters and this cumulative effect could hurt Trump if they turn against him? BRODY: Yes, I think that is a distinct possibility. Having said that -- and here's the other part and this is the important part as well, Anderson, there's a lot of evangelicals that did not actually vote for Trump in 2016 and those folks will see a lot of his actions in these first couple years of his administration and go, ""You know what, he was right on judges, he was right on the life issue, he was right on the embassy in Jerusalem.""

I support President Bush's commitment to bipartisanship. I'm going to try to do better this time. I supported Trent Lott in trying to reach an agreement that we wouldn't be fighting here in the beginning of this session, even though some felt maybe it had gone too far. We need to work together. And I think this hearing is a bit of a test. The independent groups, hard-left that they are, have every right to speak and advocate and raise questions. But I think this body needs to evaluate it and give John Ashcroft a fair hearing, in terms of what was known to him, what was the circumstances when he made these decisions, and not take them out of context and give it a spin that's unfair to him. All of us have done things, if taken out of context and twisted about, could be an honest statement, but be a misrepresentation of what's happening. John has not been an obstructionist here. I've looked at the numbers. He voted for 95 percent of President Clinton's judicial nominees. He voted for 26 of 27 African-Americans; the only one that was raised, Ronnie White, is the only one he's opposed. And he had a personal and good reason for that, in my view. He's going to be a champion of prosecution of gun laws. Under this administration prosecutions have dropped. I've talked to John about it. He's committed to me that he's going to work to increase the number of people that are prosecuted for violation of gun laws in America. And in my view, they can be done dramatically with no new resources, frankly. And on Bill Lann Lee, this committee split on that vote. SESSIONS: And, Chairman Hatch, if you'd like to read a brilliant address on it, read his speech on the floor about why he opposed Bill Lann Lee. That was not a racial thing. It was a serious discussion about his views about whether or not he would actually follow the Adarand Supreme Court decision. The Adarand case, he said he would support, but the way he defined it, in our view, was not an accurate definition of it. So then he would not be enforcing Adarand if he didn't properly understand Adarand. So that was the basis of our opposition there. So I would just say this: I believe that John Ashcroft has all the gifts and graces to make a great attorney general. I believe he will be a great attorney general. I believe he will serve this country with distinction. I believe this department will flourish under his leadership. I know he will be responsive to us if we have problems.

It's kind of he said/she said at this point. BALDWIN: That's why the iPad video is so clutch, but it's smashed and it will take a couple of weeks, you were telling me? SMITH: Right. It could take weeks, even months, said the police today. But the key to that is going to be who attacked whom, because is someone hits someone else with that iPad, that's potentially domestic battery. That could carry anywhere up to, depending on how it's looked at, a year in prison. That's max, by the way. BALDWIN: So, with domestic battery under Florida law, police actually decide whether or not those charges could be filed, correct? SMITH: Right. It's up to police. Now, what they want, if police are filing charges like this, they want the victim in this case to step behind them and say, yes, I will testify. Yes, I want to press charges. But police can go forward either way and press charges if they think a crime has been committed. So the question is going to be what is on that iPad? Because if it shows someone hit someone else, that's something they could move forward with. BALDWIN: No pressure on that technician to put the pieces back together. SMITH: Oh, boy.

BOLDUAN: Regardless, if you're a juror, it has to make an impact, even if they have to make a distinction. CALLAN: Here's what the prosecutor is going to say to this Texas jury. That statement indicates that he was shooting them, he had a motive. It's a lame motive. But it shows that he was punishing them for not talking to him. That means he understood that what he was doing was going to have consequences. So they're positing that to use that as their argument that this doesn't meet the insanity standard from a legal standpoint. BOLDUAN: It's so confusing. It really is difficult to follow all the twists and turns. Including this one. Eddie Ray Routh has an uncle. The uncle eventually says, in the course of the investigation, that Routh pulled up and told him, ""I'm driving a dead man's truck,"" referencing Chris kill's truck, which he tried to escape in. But the uncle wasn't alarmed because Eddie Ray Routh said crazy things all the time. CALLAN: Yes. And the uncle, you know, repeated that testimony. But he also repeated other testimony that the two of them discussed religion often. He played some kind of a Jesus hymn, which the prosecutor is going say, once again, is an indication that Routh understood the difference between right and wrong, and if he understands the difference between right and wrong, he doesn't meet the Texas insanity law. Texas law is so strange. I'll just tell you one story. There's a guy who's on death row now, who, when he was tried, wore a purple cowboy suit, subpoenaed John F. Kennedy, the pope, and 200 other witnesses to his trial. He was rambling incoherently. A Texas jury convicted him in one day and sentenced him to death. They didn't buy the insanity defense in that case. So it's a tough mountain to climb in Texas if you claim insanity. BOLDUAN: I would say so. We don't know that Eddie Ray Routh is wearing any of those things or trying to have any of those people come to testify in this case. CALLAN: Not so far. BOLDUAN: Not so far. CALLAN: OK.

Joseph Estrada faces charges of perjury and plunder during an administration hit by economic turmoil. CNN's Maria Ressa is in Manila. Maria, what happened today? MARIA RESSA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well Mr. Estrada faced the first of three corruption-related charges against him: that of perjury, in effect fact that he understated or misdeclared his net worth in 1999. The court proceedings lasted about 45 minutes. Security was very tight. It was a very controlled environment. Thousands of police holding back a small crowd of anti-Estrada demonstrators, and journalist. Unlike the impeachment proceedings from last year, television cameras were not allowed in this courtroom. The charge was read, and Mr. Estrada was asked to answer a plea. He refused to say guilty or not guilty on the advice, he said, of his lawyers. On the absence of a plea from Mr. Estrada the court automatically entered a plea of not guilty and set the next hearing on this case for August 2 -- Dalton. TANONAKA: Maria, part of the case involves plunder. What does that mean? And what does that entail as far as the monetary he is said to have had? RESSA: Well, the economic plunder case really is the main charge against Mr. Estrada. It's the reason he is under detention, because it's a non-bailable charge and carries the maximum penalty of death. The charges against any government official who amasses illegal wealth above a certain amount was originally created at the reaction to the billions of dollars allegedly stolen by former President Marcos. Mr. Estrada's lawyers are challenging legality of that law. They did succeed in delaying that case for two weeks. Ironically, Mr. Estrada was one of the proponents of that law when he was a senator.

The U.S. is imposing new security checks on electronic devices in the coming hours. Any device bigger than a cell phone will have to be out of its cover and will be subject to inspection separate from any other luggage. Well, meanwhile, the electronics ban imposed in March for U.S.-bound flights is coming to an end. Nine of the ten airports affected have already had the restrictions lifted. And the airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia is expected to be next. The U.S. Homeland Security Department says the airports have enhanced security measures to comply with U.S. standards. Well, South Korean authorities are investigating how a famous defector ended up back in North Korea. Over the weekend, Jeon Hye Sung was shown in a propaganda video released by Pyongyang. Tearfully describing how hard her life had been in the south. It's unclear how she got back to the North after defecting more than three years ago. David McKenzie has more. DAVID MCKENZIE, INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN: A North Korean celebrity confessing in a propaganda video on a government-sponsored web site. She looks shell shocked, even scared. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIM JI-HYUN, NORTH KOREAN DEFECTOR (through translator): In South Korea everything was about money. As a woman who defected, I betrayed my father land. Was only met with physical and mental pain. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCKENZIE: In fact, Lim Ji-hyun as she was known in the South, appeared on reality TV and talk shows telling what her life was like in the North. She defected in 2014. Lin's many fans are shocked that she went back to the repressive country. Fellow guests on the show said she was happy and successful in the South.

(END VIDEO CLIP) MCKENZIE: It's very rare for defectors to go back to North Korea, which is ruled with an iron fist. To friends and fans speculating that she was pressured to go, or even abducted.

HARRIS: I got a heads-up that we'll see some tape soon with the president and the regulators you were talking about, people who are very much stakeholders in all this. Here is the tape right now. Ali, stay with if you can, as we listen in. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Got everybody? All right. Well, I'm looking forward to a constructive conversation with these outstanding regulators and supervisors who have helped us design how we're going to approach a critical problem in our economy. I'll have more to say about it this afternoon. But I want to publicly thank them for their service to the country. Thanks, guys. HARRIS: All right. So there you go. Boy, Ali, I'm trying to figure out the best way to explain what's coming here. We've talked about derivatives, talked about credit default swaps and what the proposals for the president will do to help fix some of the abuses in these areas. First of all, what the heck are derivatives? How do they contribute to the mess in the financial sector? What does the president propose to do about? VELSHI: This is my coffee. I went and paid for my coffee. This is my coffee, I get to drink it. If I rent to you the right to drink some of this coffee for 15 minutes, that is a derivative of my asset. The coffee is my asset. You get to do something with it for 15 minutes or you get to use the cup after I've cleaned it. The derivative is something based off a base investment. Most of us working stiffs just get to take advantage of the basic investment. The derivatives are everything around that. The right to buy it later, the right to sell it at a particular price, the right to convert it into something else. Those are derivatives. That's where the financial market gets very creative. That's not necessarily all bad. But if you don't regulate it, people can start to make money in ways that the government never would have really thought about because the government is not supposed to be at the front end of that. Sometimes it can be very risky. Some of the derivatives that were designed to be hedges, to enhance your safety and return, end up being very dangerous like the credit default swaps that AIG was involved with. That's what the government wants to keep an eye on. HARRIS: Let's do this. When you're here next week, let's spend more time on this. I've got you so close to the top of the hour, and you have more business to do on the radio show. Ali, as always, great to talk to you. See you next week, Doc. VELSHI: See you next week.

And essentially what they are allowing him to do by not putting anything on the air about his record is to portray that record as moderate, down the middle, common sense, with the populace. And again, I think if they attack his record as, instead of a guy that's moderate, a guy that can't be counted upon in the tough fights on the issues that New Yorkers most care about like education and abortion and gun control, and the environment for that matter, I think they are blowing their opportunity to create for the first impression. MESERVE: And, Josh, one last question for you, Lazio got the support this week out of the Conservative Party, Hillary Clinton of the Liberal Party. In New York, what difference does that make? BENSON: Well, it wasn't a surprise to anyone. The Conservative Party especially has been particularly important to Republicans statewide. They helped George Pataki get over the top in 1994, and Lazio very badly needed it. But I think it became clear as soon as Mayor Giuliani dropped out of the race that he was going to get it, so no big surprise there.

But today you can eat lobster tails if we closed it down right now, because we're still hanging in there. The bulls are still hanging in there. And we actually got some good news on the jobs front. It's been so busy. And that's one of the reasons why the market's so volatile, whether it's Congress or the economic stimulus plan or the Federal Reserve or corporate earnings. Economic data, jobless claims, the number of people seeking unemployment benefits last week fell for the fourth straight week. And the claims fell to the lowest level in four months. That's good news. What's bad news is the turmoil we're seeing among bond insurers. That is a niche in the financial market. You know they've been rocked. Security capital shares are down 24 percent after a ratings agency downgraded its financial strength. Why is that? Well, ratings agencies have been worried about bond insurers and about their ability to make payment on claims. What kind of claims? It all comes back to subprime loans. Believe it or not, as those risky mortgages default, bonds backed by those troubled loans could also default and some ratings agencies are worried that in a worst case scenario, a whole flood of them could put such pressure on bond insurers that they wouldn't be able to make payment. That's a concern. You're seeing that play out vividly, even though the three major averages are up right now.

So, the situation is if you look at the data that was analyzed, right now, you don't need it right at this moment, because the one thing you want to make sure you do is you protect people from getting serious illness, requiring hospitalization. So, at that moment, the protection is still high. But when you plot it, and look at the curve that you just mentioned, from the New York cohort, from the Mayo Clinic cohort, it's going down the wrong direction. And if you look at what's gone on, in Israel, the same thing happened. And then they started to get in trouble. We had more serious disease and hospitalization. So, rather than waiting until that happens, in the future, a month to three months from now, we want to do the boosters now, to prevent that. Use the hockey analogy. You want to skate where the puck is going to be, not where the puck is. So, what they said is true, right at this moment, the protection, against hospitalization and death, is still very high. But given the ominous signs of the protection diminishing, for infection, and clinical disease, we want to make sure we're not all of a sudden in trouble, and then decide we're going to do something about it, as opposed to anticipating the problem, and doing something about it right now.

Things the president wants this morning? A conversation with Robert Mueller, a shutdown and a parade, not necessarily in that order. Things that key White House advisers and senior Republicans don't seem to want this morning? A conversation with Robert Mueller, a shutdown and a parade, not necessarily in that order. Yes, on a morning Republicans and Democrats say they are very close to what would be a major spending deal to keep the government running and fund the military for two years, an eternity in Washington terms, the president is still talking about a government shutdown. On a morning when the president's lawyers and friends say that he should not sit down with investigators from the special counsel's office because he might get caught lying, the president is saying he can handle the truth. Also, the president wants a parade, a big one with tanks and troops because in a nutshell he likes parades and wants one. Much more on that coming up. But first, words we don't speak very often because it's a thing that doesn't happen very often. We're getting whispers this morning turning into shouts that we could be minutes away from a big, substantive bipartisan deal on Capitol Hill. So let's get right to the breaking details. Suzanne Malveaux on Capitol Hill with the very latest. Suzanne, what are you hearing? SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, John, I just spoke with Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat, saying do not let the president taunt you, do not fall into his trap. There is a possibility of immigration on the one hand and also this big budget deal that's in the works on the Senate side, a bipartisan deal that could avoid some of the short-term spending deals, if you will, the spits and stops in funding the government. Here is what they are looking at, the potential here. It would fund the government for six weeks up to March 23rd while they sort out some of these other things, things that Democrats and Republicans want. Significantly increasing defense as well as domestic spending for two years in the tune of $300 billion-plus, includes a disaster relief package for those areas ravaged by the hurricanes.

We're going to have more on that in just a moment. A lot more on that in just a moment to tell you about. But tonight, we've also got to talk about all the president's enemies, OK? Well, his perceived enemies, at least, anybody who doesn't knuckle under and give him exactly what he wants, anybody who stands for something, like John McCain. President Trump just, he won't let it go. Went won't let go of his grudge against the late senator and war hero, by the way, who died of brain cancer in late August. But the president doubled down again today after blaming McCain with blatantly false race tweets over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years. And then he got to a vote and he said, thumbs down. And our country would have saved a trillion dollars and we would have had great health care. So, he campaigned. He told us hours before that he was going to repeal and replace. And for some time, I think I understand the reason, he ended up going thumbs up. And frankly, had we even known that, I think we would have gotten the vote, because we could have gotten somebody else. So, I think that's disgraceful. Plus, there were other things. I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: Just let it go, man. The reason I say that is because, I need to remind you, the senator's no vote on repealing Obamacare was in July of 2017. that was two and a half years ago. The president still can't let go of it. Even after the senator's death. And in response to his accusation that McCain misled him about his vote, a former McCain aide today said the president is lying. It's also clear this was never all about Obamacare. Donald Trump made no secret of his hatred for John McCain. Who can forget this during the campaign? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: He's not a war hero.

Now, when Trump repealed the DACA executive order from Obama, what he said is, the Congress is -- you fix it now, I want legislation on this. Well, the Republicans control the House and the Senate and let us make sure that we have decent legislation. And the good news is, by the way, is that you have Republican senators working with Democratic senators who are making progress on this issue, may not be what I want exactly. But we are making progress and protecting the legal status of these wonderful young people. CUOMO: I'm just saying, if you have the president come out of this immigration deal with the high ground of being a unifier and getting a wall after he calls the immigrants, people who come from shitholes, it's not good for the Democrats who are counting on you guys to get your job done. That's why I bring it up. And that's why incidentally senator, you're hearing these calls that would have been seen as fantastical before Trump for Oprah Winfrey. What do you think about Oprah Winfrey running for president, while I have you? I know you hate talking about the presidential cycle. Too bad.

CUOMO: Would you run against Oprah in a primary? SANDERS: See -- no, no. We're not going to get there. I do not believe in never ending campaigns, so I know you guys do. I don't. And that's not what the American people want. What the American people want us to do is to start working for the middle class and working families and not worry about who's going to run for what in three years.

Ellis, starting with you here, how difficult do you think it will be for Republicans to push this through along with this president for a legislative win? ELLIS HENICAN, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it's make or break. They certainly have a tremendous incentive to try and get this done. They're all in the desired page. That's not a problem. But then you get down to the details of mad tax reform, mighty complicated. When you take something away from one pile to give it to another, you end up making both angry. So, it's going to be a tough fight, but they do have an incentive to make it work. HOWELL: Ben, do you agree? BEN FERGUSON, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: I do. Look, I think that this is going to be a tough battle any time you're doing something to change the tax code. But I also think there is very much an appetite for it in this country. The question is, can politicians actually be bipartisan and have a real conversation about this, and actually look at getting things done for the American people? If you look at the polls, the average American says that they do think there needs to be some refining of the tax code. Everybody almost agrees there needs to be a simplification of the tax code. And so lower taxes adding on that as well and helping with small business owners with some of the tax breaks that they would receive. This should be something that should be able to get done in congress. Again, you're talking about congress. And most Americans also say that they suck at their jobs. So, who knows if they can actually pull it off or not. HOWELL: So, the president will need members of his own party obviously to push this through. Many of the people though that he has publicly attacked, people like Senator Mitch McConnell, who was asked whether those attacks could hurt President Trump's efforts on this. Let's listen here. We can talk about it on the other side. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You've been on the receiving end of several of those attacks. Do they help you get legislation through the senate, sir? MCCONNELL: Look, I'm not particularly concerned about all of this. What we're interested in is achieving an agenda for the American people.

The government was arguing that the judge's settlement had the effect of increasing illegal immigration because people maybe heard about it and were coming to the southern border. That rubbed the judge the wrong way. The Trump administration also cited a lot of the political pressure, the chaos that's all over these detention centers, the lack of coordination between different agencies. And what the judge said in response, and backed up by the ACLU's position, is that while the chaos is of your own making, this is something that you did. She said she found all of the Trump administration's arguments very dubious, unconvincing. She did not want it put back on her. What this means is that 20 days -- there's a requirement under the Flores settlement that, after 20 days, children have to be released from detention. And why that matters right now, as families start to be reunified, immediately the clock will start ticking on the 20 days by -- under which the kids have to then be released. The Trump administration doesn't want to let families out altogether. Although they could with, say, ankle bracelets, monitoring devices. What we'll see ahead, they will appeal this to the Ninth Circuit. If they rule against the Trump administration, this is where it really gets into uncharted territory. It could potentially go to the Supreme Court. The justice in charge of the Ninth Circuit is Justice Kennedy. His resignation is effective July 31st. So there's a gray area. If it's before or after that, who will handle it on the Supreme Court now, and will that case ultimately get to the high court? BOLDUAN: A lot to watch there. REYES: Yes. Very complicated. BOLDUAN: But it all comes down to a simple fact. As this judge says, these children are blameless. They're separated from their parents. REYES: Exactly. BOLDUAN: You guys got to get it together and fix it. REYES: Exactly. BOLDUAN: Great to see you -- (CROSSTALK) REYES: The tough part is that the court process moves so slow. But these kids are in detention now. They need their parents' help. BOLDUAN: Yes. Exactly right. Raul, we'll see what happens with this deadline today and what happens next. Coming up for us, President Trump is en route to meeting with key NATO allies, and yet, the meeting, he says, will be the easiest with Russian President Vladimir Putin. What? And why? Next.

That money is crucial in order to get development projects going, to get this rubble removed. The rubble is still everywhere. People can't move back into their neighborhoods to get new homes to be built. It all costs money. And until that donor money shows up, it seems like it's not going to happen. President Clinton says he's going to dedicate the next seven weeks to really trying to get donors to set out a schedule of when they are actually going to start to send the money so that the Haitian government here and the Clinton commission that he's co-chairing with Haiti's prime minister, can actually start to distribute some of that money and get some of the long-term recovery and rebuilding projects going. I also talked to the president about a problem that we found and we've heard from a lot of the NGOs, non-governmental organizations, the charities that are working down here. Basically, when they're bringing in emergency supplies and building supplies for the Haitian people, for the relief effort, they're getting hit at the airport or at the ports with taxes by customs officials. Taxes of 20 percent. We brought in $5,000 worth of relief supplies from one organization that we were requested to, and a customs official has tried to charge us $1,000 for those relief supplies that's basically going for the benefit of the Haitian people. That's something the president said the Haitian government should not be doing. He's trying to get it changed. I talked to former President Clinton about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I agree with that, but keep in mind, I -- it is not for lack of effort. We have met with the groups in the United States, representing over 90 percent of the funds spent by NGOs here. They all promised to work with us through the commission to coordinate their activities, to put them on the internet, to describe how much money they put in Haiti and where it was being spent. COOPER: Because unless they are coordinated and working with you -- CLINTON: Exactly. COOPER: It makes no sense. A lot of NGOs are running into problems when they're bringing in emergency supplies, building supplies. They're getting hit at customs with taxes or huge storage fees. We brought in for one organization $5,000 worth of equipment for building -- CLINTON: And it wasn't pre-approved, so they made them pay fees. COOPER: We got hit up for a thousand dollars in fees. Twenty percent of the cost. And a lot of NGOs say that happens, and the government gets that storage fee money. CLINTON: Yes.

I think John McCain is an American hero and, you know, quick to honor his service on behalf of our country. But we've got some big problems that we're facing right now. You know, I meet families all the time literally are having to make decisions about do they drive to work this morning or do they pay the electricity bill? I meet families who don't have health care for their kids or themselves despite the fact that they have one, two, three jobs, in some cases. So those are the kinds of issues that aren't going to lend themselves to sound bites. They're not going to lend themselves to clever ads.

(END VIDEO CLIP) BATTISTA: Well, that may be the bottom line there from our Internet friend. Joining us now is Susan Eckstein, professor of sociology of Boston University, and author of ""Back From the Future: Cuba Under Castro."" And Susan, a lot of the discussion at least among our audiences deals with the sort of life that Elian Gonzalez would be returning to. You know, we hear about the communist regime in Cuba and we hear about, you know, Fidel Castro and we hear Cuban exiles call him murderer, and -- but what do -- most Americans don't really understand or know what kind of life this little boy will have back in Cuba. Can you help us with that? SUSAN ECKSTEIN, BOSTON UNIVERSITY: Surely. Life is, of course, not nearly as bad as many of the Cuban exiles believe, and it is not as wonderful as many people would like. It is somewhere in between. Economically, certain -- certainly people and children don't have the consumer goods -- the wealth of consumer goods that children here have. On the other hand, they do have some, and they are allowed to have more, and even Cuban -- even U.S. foreign policy allows for remittances so that children can get dollars to buy the things that they can have in this country. In terms of health care, Cuba does wonderfully for a Third World country. Life expectancy for men is about what is -- in Havana is about the same as it is for men in this country. Infant mortality rates are about three times higher in Washington, D.C. than they are in the Cuban capital, Havana. So there is good health care, there is good education. There -- both of these, of course, are getting worse with the current crisis in Cuba. In the 1990s, since the collapse of Soviet aid and Soviet trade, conditions have gotten worse. There is -- Cuba is in an economic depression and as a consequence of this, living standards have deteriorated, health standards have deteriorated, but the country does have the infrastructure for this. If you look at the pictures of Elian's school and the community in which he lived, you see that people look healthy, happy, and so I do think he would return to a good life, and most of all, of course, he would enjoy the comfort of his father at a time of losing his mother. BATTISTA: Is it your impression that Elian's father is speaking or able to speak freely? ECKSTEIN: I have no reason to think otherwise.

He was being sort of under low-class by doing that. This is the same thing. The wheel has turned and he has gotten a hold of it, no? MANIGAULT: Absolutely. And, he is separated himself from the snores and the bores. He has connected with all the people who understand that you have to bring more to the table than just going down and saying old promises.

2366689,2687618,CNN,At This Hour,"put another way, in paraphrasing your own words from your opening statement, if after 20 years and hundreds of billion dollars of dollars in support, equipment and training, there is not enough for the Afghan government to become more resilience or self-sustained, what do we think is going to happen as that support began to be removed? What do think we think was going to happen when the terrible status quo was changed? It doesn't stake in exquisite piece of intelligence or some brilliant analysis to conclude that if you radically change an already bad status quo by removing U.S. and NATO forces by enabling air support, that the status quo was going to collapse in favor of the Taliban. This is not an argument in favor of staying. I think that ship has sailed. We know a lot of time has been spent on justifying the withdrawal. We're not debating the withdrawal. What I'm arguing is, we had a terrible status quo as is, by your own admission, and the Afghan government after billions of dollars in 20 years, and was not self- sustaining, was not resilient, we should have known that as we begin to draw down support, we were going to see the potential for a collapse and that is what all of these pieces pointed to as well. So, it's concerning that no one saw all of this and concluded that there was no evidence or no reason to believe that there could be a rapid collapse. More to that point, we began to seek clear signs weeks ago that this is where it was headed. Without air strikes, the Taliban now began to mass and maneuver going from intimidating the small Afghan outposts, to actually getting them into -- we were seeing Afghan outposts beginning to quit. They went from surrounding the small provincial capitals to surrounding major cities, with 5,000 to 8,000 Taliban fighters. This is weeks before. By the way, this is at same time as I believe on July 8th, President Biden was still giving this naive optimistic prediction about the fighting capabilities of the Afghan forces and so forth. We could see them meticulously focused on the north. We could see that they were methodically and carefully splintering the sclerotic remains of any sort of resistance, weeks before the fall of Kabul. You could see the Taliban was on the verge, was headed towards doing something they hadn't done before. They were going to isolate Kabul from the north, cutting off all of their supply routes. So we knew weeks before -- we knew weeks before that we were headed for a Taliban controlled north, all of the traditional routes of Taliban encroachment on Kabul were nearly sealed, the south and the east, and Kabul faced the prospect of no fuel. The Afghan government faced the prospect of being unable to mount any viable opposition and sustained defense. What did we think was going to happen?

I don't know if the loud speaker went out as part of the explosion in the front car or not, but many of us were, you know, just sort of making it up as we went. We had to. LEMON: Yes. So how quickly did you get off of the train? Did you try to help other people before getting off of the train? WALLACE: Yes, I was somehow able to remain calm, and I tried to help others to remain calm.

I was able to get the attention of one of the people in lead, and remind them to stay calm, and that is the only way that we would be all right. I was able to make eye contact, and emotional contact, and letting them know that if we stayed calm we'd be all right. LEMON: Were you worried about yourself, your life or mostly concerned about the people in that first car? WALLACE: You know, I have to say that I really was not concerned for myself. We did not seem to be any immediate danger in the second car, and there was some of us looking for the fire extinguisher, which we now know wouldn't have done a lot of good, but we found it, and tried to pass it forward. We tried to get into the first car and saw shapes of people moving around in the smoke, and we knew it had to be absolutely hell in there, and we were worrying about the people expiring because of the smoke inhalation. So we tried desperately to get the door open and it was locked. There was a man ahead of me. He tried to kick the glass to no avail. It's a pretty thick glass between the cars.

MCALEENAN: Very unfortunate that parents are putting their children at risk and bringing them into that situation to try to rush through the border illegally and being present for that kind of interaction. If people are throwing rocks nearby, you are facing law enforcement professionals, it's not a good play for you to have your children. So it's very unfortunate that some children and women had to rush away from the gas and were affected. CUOMO: Right. Right, I just want to try and get it straight for the audience what was going on. And again, this isn't about you having to own what the President says. He wasn't there. I don't know where he is getting his information. The idea that a lot of officers were seriously hurt and that's why this had to be done, that's not true. They were hurt but thank God they had the right equipment on. They didn't have to save their lives in situation. So that's good for the audience to understand. But the idea that the parents were putting the kids in harm's way, Commissioner, why, if they are making a run for it -- that's what they are trying to do, they're trying to get across the border. There was no way to avoid putting tear gas where those mothers and kids were? MCALEENAN: So it's inherently dangerous to try to enter with a large group making a rush across the border. CUOMO: Right. MCALEENAN: When lead elements of that group are throwing rocks to try to back off a border patrol agents who are trying to prevent that dangerous situation from unfolding, you have to be aware that we have to resolve that and secure that border. CUOMO: Was there an order given by you or other in command saying, this is what you do if this happens? MCALEENAN: That's not how law enforcement use of force works. It's up to the professional law enforcement agents and officers on the ground who go through rigorous training, who have to follow strict use of force policy that's in constitutional parameters, that's tested and trained and use equipment that we have vetted, verified and they have been certified to use. So it's based on that individual officer's perception, the totality of the circumstances they face to choose what method to resolve that situation with. CUOMO: You are going to review it, I know that. The Mexican authorities are also asking for it to be reviewed. That is an interesting point that they are making, commissioner.

That is stunning because I think also, Erin, a lot of Republicans disagree with that. That question that was asked to Christopher Wray, that was asked by a Republican lawmaker.

That's the businessman Donald Trump which you can ask yourself why did he never call the FBI if he saw something illegal, showing that he's never morphed into the commander in chief and the person that the constitution expects to protect the United States democratic system.

They first denied the meetings and they said the meetings were about adoptions and they said, ""Well, the meetings really didn't matter.""

So they've been laying this out, just quickly to think about it both in terms of offense and defense. Offense is this is a welcome mat. It is a come hither, not just for the Russians, but for the Chinese and not just Donald Trump but for every Republican running that he wants to win in the House or the Senate. On the defense side, this may be related to concerns Donald Trump has about some of these pending cases and what they are going to show about his family's collusion, I'm going to use the word, with the Russians.

WENDY MURPHY, FORMER PROSECUTOR: Well, there's so much to what we don't know and Avenatti setting very low expectations suggests that there still could be more to it even after tonight is over, and if we all say, oh, that was a big yawn, there's not a whole lot more to it than salacious details, I don't think the story ends but I do think the public's attention might wane a little bit. So my concern is, obviously, not about the sex, but about campaign finance laws and the possibility that the president may, in fact, some day face a perjury charge related to this case if he has to submit to deposition, for example, in Avenatti's state court case in California. So tonight if we hear anything at all about connections between Trump's campaign, Trump himself, and the money that Stormy Daniels received only days before the general election in November of 2016, that could change the trajectory of this story and it could very much change the president's legal exposure or at a minimum Michael Cohen's legal exposure because thus far, we've been told there's no there- there. There's no connection. This was a private deal. Michael Cohen made the payment. It was all to protect the president's family from shame and nobody I know thinks that's true that Michael Cohen really did that only out of the personal goodness of his heart. The question is whether we'll hear more about those possible connections tonight and whether that disc that we've all seen a picture of now, the disc that Avenatti sent a photo of on Twitter claiming there's stuff there, I think his implication is that there are documents that will corroborate whatever shocking details Stormy Daniels does talk about tonight. So the president won't be in a position to say she's a liar because there's going to be something in writing to prove that she's telling the truth. WHITFIELD: Yes. We don't know what stuff is on that DVD that's in that safe that he, you know, tweeted out that photograph, Amy, but, you know, Daniels' attorney he is essentially threatening the president and his team. That they need to be careful about what they say out loud, how they respond out loud, to that interview tonight. Do you think, you know, that will silence the president who has already attached his name to a legal challenge against her but at the same time denying that there was an affair? AMY KREMER, CO-CHAIR, WOMEN VOTE TRUMP: So, Fredricka, I think that -- I mean, Stormy is riding this all the way to the bank. I mean, that is what she's doing this to promote herself. I mean, she is obviously a PR (INAUDIBLE) and good for (INAUDIBLE). We all love to make money. But just in general, I'm not an attorney and don't play one on TV but in",0.8374857257337474,2018-03-25

HAYES: That lawsuit alleges that the law as written does not allow for subsidies through federal exchanges to be applied in states that did not create their own exchange. An argument one constitutional scholar called preposterous. In Ohio, Republicans are fighting the Medicaid expansion in the state championed by Republican governor John Kasich. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ohio`s Republican governor bypasses the state legislature to get approval to expand Medicaid in Ohio. HAYES: The expansion was approved by independent committee after it was blocked by Republican lawmakers in the statehouse and Senate. It would ensure 275,000 people in the state. Yesterday, six state Republican lawmakers sued, saying the board did not have the authority to approve the expansion. If it hasn`t dawned on you that there is no end to the fight, it should by now. Seventy years from now, conservatives will still be trying to kill the Affordable Care Act. Oh, sure. Eventually they`ll talk about how it`s part of the nation`s ironclad commitment to the people. RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT: This bill demonstrates for all time our nation`s ironclad commitment to Social Security. HAYES: But in their unguarded moments, Republicans will still be saying it`s a hoax. GOV. RICK PERRY (R), TECAS: It is a Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 or 30 years old, that you`re paying into a program that will be there. Anybody for the status quo with Social Security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids. (END VIDEOTAPE) HAYES: Joining me now is one of the six lawmakers who filed the suit against Ohio Governor John Kasich over the state`s Medicaid expansion, Ohio state representative, Republican Matt Lynch. Representative Lynch, thank you for coming on tonight. Why do you want to deny these 270,000 Ohioans Medicaid? STATE REP. MATT LYNCH (R), OHIO: Chris, thanks for having me. I knew it would be fun. That is not really the issue for us in this lawsuit, Chris. We found a lawsuit to preserve the constitutional system in the state of Ohio that separates the legislative from the executive authority. HAYES: Let me stop you right there. I totally understand that. There`s a question before the court that has to do with the Ohio state constitution, and I will admit to you, Representative, I am not an expert on the Ohio state constitution. But the point here to me is the lawsuit you`ve reverse engineered around opposition to the substance of the policy. I mean, you don`t want Medicaid expanded. You`re going to do whatever it takes to make sure that doesn`t happen. Isn`t that right? LYNCH: Well, it`s true I don`t want Medicaid expanded. And, frankly, many, many members of the legislature do not want Medicaid expanded. But we`re still debating that issue. We`ve never brought it to a floor vote. And, frankly, this action by the controlling board is what`s preventing it. The controlling board simply masqueraded as a legislative body. On Monday, for",0.0317028451866411,2013-10-23

Over here, some chopped tomatoes in a can. Some baked beans. Pasta ready to be cooked. Lots of other things. It's all expected to last between seven and ten days for a single family, so it's not that much. But charities are saying that as the global recession intensifies, more and more British families will be dependent on handouts like these just to survive. CHANCE (voice-over): The British government says it's committed to eradicating child poverty. Save the Children complains they're not doing enough. And this first British fundraising campaign, says the charity, may keep some children here off the poverty line. Matthew Chance, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE) RAJPAL: Well, last year in the UK, food banks run by the organization Trussell Trust fed over 128,000 people. That's 100 percent more than they did in 2010. I want you to take a look at this map here of the UK. The green pins show just where the food banks are across the country, and the pink pins are showing you just where they want to plan -- to open in the future. A lot of these -- many of those are in the northern city of Manchester, where in 2010 nearly half of the children were in poverty. That's according to the campaign to end child poverty. We're joined now by Laurence Chandy, and expert in global economy and development from the Brookings Institution. Thank you very much for being with us, Mr. Chandy. These children in the UK are going without essential items, and that is, indeed, a growing concern. But are they considered poor if you compare them to children in Bangladesh or Niger? LAURENCE CHANDY, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: Well, it's not really a fair comparison. I think you spelled that out well in the introductory piece. When we talk about poverty in the developing world, we use an absolute poverty line of a dollar a day. It doesn't matter -- whether the country grows richer over time, we stick with that same measure. Whereas in the UK, like in other Western countries, we use a relative measure of poverty, which does change over time, it does change with the fortunes of the other people in the economy. And at the moment, the UK's poverty line is equivalent to around $10 a day. So, it's really a very different figure, and it reflects a very different experience being in poverty in the West compared to being in poverty in the developing world. RAJPAL: OK. When we talk about poverty in the West, then, the UK is not the only developed country suffering tough economic times.

WATSON: To put all this in perspective, Richard Gephardt is not just fighting to win in Iowa, he literally is fighting for his political life. He's been in office for 27 years. And as Julian has said before, if he losses Monday, he doesn't just step out of the race, he steps out of politics. So expect more bitter campaigning, not less, like it or not. EPSTEIN: Yes, but Anderson, final point, if you got a second. COOPER: I already -- take it. EPSTEIN: The notion of going after Dean -- Gephardt going after Dean is nuts. The people that Gephardt ought to be going after are the independents and the centrists. Shooting at Dean right now is a real mistake. That's why Edwards is moving up. Real mistake on the part of Gephardt. COOPER: All right. Leave it at there. Julian Epstein, Carlos Watson good to talk to you. Thanks very much. Got a lot in. The Iowa Caucuses aren't always the best predictor of who will win the party's nomination. A quick news note for you, 1980, George H.W.

LISA BLOOM, COURT TV: Hi. COOPER: Should they be able to open up these records? Should the jury be able to see them? BLOOM: First of all, I've read both the prosecution and the defense papers. The defense argues, essentially, that because she's bi-polar she has no credibility. That's a big leap that I don't think is established in their papers. They are going to have to prove to the satisfaction to the Judge. There's about 2 million people who are bi-polar. You're doing this wonderful special on depression all week. Bi-polar disorder is, essentially manic depression. Depression doesn't correlate in any way with psychosis, with delusions, with hallucinations, that's what they're going to need to show. COOPER: Right, but the defense is saying, look, if she has some sort of track record of unusual behavior, of behavior involving sex, maybe that has some sort of impact on this case.

So Jackie Kennedy put herself forward in a very vocal and a very strong way as a trendsetter and as someone who wanted to make the White House beautiful. Melania, to date, the first lady, has not been as public a figure and has not really put herself forward for that. And maybe she will, but at this point, she is not, certainly, in the same mold as first lady Jackie Kennedy. CABRERA: I've got to ask you about this other comment the President made in the clip that we saw from ABC News this morning, in which he talks about Richard Nixon, basically saying that he didn't fire Robert Mueller because it didn't work out so well for Nixon. Do you think the President actually learned from history? Is this some evidence of him learning lessons? NAFTALI: Well, let me tell you that that is a very good lesson to have learned if you want to stay in office. What started the impeachment process against Richard Nixon was the Saturday night massacre. The American people were not in favor of impeachment after the Saturday night massacre, but they were in favor of starting impeachment proceedings. So somebody around the President -- and maybe the president, although I doubt it, but someone around the President knew the history and said to the President, you want to do something that is a true red line in our politics? Because President Trump is proud that he can cross most every red line and emerge unscathed. They probably said to him, this one you can't cross. So either he learned the lesson or someone enforced the lesson on him. Either way, it was the right thing for him to do if he wanted to stay and finish his term. CABRERA: All right, we'll see.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Shots ring out at sea, a NATO warship in hot pursuit of Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. The Canadian frigate spotted the pirates trying to hijack a Norwegian cargo ship. After a seven-hour chase, they grabbed the pirates, questioned them, then released them. Canada's prime minister defending the tactics: STEPHEN HARPER, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: We obviously act within our legal authorities and also within our capacities, and in this case, as you know, we did briefly detain pirates and disarm them. And I think that was the appropriate -- those were the appropriate measures under the circumstances. MCKENZIE: NATO says that arresting pirates is not within their mandate, despite international conventions clearly stating that any warship can detain pirates. Earlier in the weekend, a Dutch ship stopped a pirate attack, freed 20 hostages, and also released the pirates. The leadership of Somalia's transitional government is not impressed with the international help. ABDURRAHMAN HAJI ADAM, SOMALI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER: This is something that we could have done something about it, but the international community still actually giving less concentration of support in Somali government to help the international community in this piracy. MCKENZIE: Coalition and NATO forces do have scores of boats off the coast patrolling against piracy. But despite their recent aggressive tactics, pirates continue to attack ships seemingly at will, hijacking a Belgian dredger ship, the Pompei, way off the coast of East Africa near the island atoll of the Seychelles some 800 miles from Somalia. Pirates are reportedly sailing the ship back to their coastline, where more than 200 sailors remaining hijacked waiting for ransom to be paid. David McKenzie, CNN, Nairobi, Kenya.

Let's hope they leave the politics at the door and have meaningful conversations. There you go, 5:30 at least. A conversation scheduled. I wonder how long that will take.

A two-week shutdown, 0.3 percent off growth. A four-week shutdown, economic growth will be cut in half. Jobs would be lost. You wouldn't have as many growing. Bad for businesses, orders, confidence.

I would say, in this case, the first question for the pilot is policy, procedure, training and I think we're going to discover that this happened exactly as it should have happened. That the pilot did what he was supposed to do. PEREIRA: Well, let's follow this thread that there was a suicide vest. That the hostage taker, indeed, has one. MUDD: Yes. PEREIRA: OK, let's go with that presumption right now. Would that not have shown up in airport screening, or could you separate those components prior to passing through security -- put them together after security and board the plane? MUDD: Let me tell you something. If we find that he had a vest that should have been discovered in pre-screening, anybody in my position is going to say let me get this straight. We went through the downing of the aircraft over the Sinai last year and months later you still couldn't come up with sufficient procedures to ensure that another person couldn't get on an aircraft with an explosive device? That would be stunning to me, Michaela. PEREIRA: Well, and Jonathan, I saw you raise your eyebrows as we were saying that because the fact is I think that is why there's a certain amount of reasonable skepticism of the Egyptian authorizes coming out saying we don't believe he has a suicide vest. GILLIAM: Right. PEREIRA: This is not terror-related. I think people want to wait a bit, given what happened with the Metrojet crash last year. GILLIAM: Yes, another good point with that and maybe go a little bit off topic here, but when the officials come out and say that immediately, from a bad guy perspective they can immediately turn around and hijack a plane and say no, no, no, we just want to go see someone, we're emotionally disturbed, and then turn this into a terrorist incident. That's the way that these people think -- these professional people that use terrorism, which is fear and intimidation to cause a political change. This is the way they think. They'll see this and they'll say we didn't think about that. PEREIRA: Right, but this is not out-and-out terrorism as we've seen in recent years, right? GILLIAM: No, not at all. PEREIRA: Because we know that this guy was making demands. GILLIAM: Yes. PEREIRA: He tried to get the plane to go further. The plane didn't have enough fuel, thus, they had to land in Cyprus.

It looks like just very plain doors on a building here. This is the same mosque that Mohamed Atta, the 9/11 -- one of the 9/11 hijackers attended and had a group of supporters. Some of the people that went with Ahmad Siddiqui (ph) to Pakistan, we're told, had strong ties and connections with Al Qaeda.

It came to symbolize the breakdown of what was meant to be a fairy tale marriage. Anwar Hussein was in the royal press pack that day. ANWAR HUSSEIN, PHOTOGRAPHER: It is iconic because she looks very small against the big expanse of the Taj Mahal. It's a big building, important building. And so, and the way in which she was sitting down there looked maybe lonely, nobody in the background. Looked like as if she was the only person in the Taj Mahal, which belonged to her. FOSTER (voice-over): The shoot was organized by then-royal press secretary, Dickie Arbiter (ph). DICKIE ARBITER, FORMER ROYAL PRESS SECRETARY: It was left to everybody else to decide what was the state of the marriage was in and I think she gave that impression by the way that she looked at the camera and what she said to one of the cameramen. PRINCESS DIANA (from captions): Healing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (from captions): In what way? DIANA (from captions): You work that out for yourself. FOSTER (voice-over): That was interpreted by those who were there as confirmation that the marriage was in trouble. ARBITER: It is recognized as a temple of love and Diana was there in front of it all alone, her husband having been there 12 years beforehand, who, incidentally, said one day I would like to bring my wife here. Well, she was there and he wasn't. FOSTER (voice-over): This wasn't the fun-loving Diana that the photographers had pictured before.

Why is this so important if, in fact, that is Trayvon Martin screaming as some of the experts have said?\n \n\n COFFEY: Well, of course it\'s critical because if, in fact, the prosecution has a reliable expert who is going to say\nthat\'s Trayvon Martin\'s voice, that\'s a very big issue and that strongly supports the prosecution theory. But for the defense\nto act surprise when this has been a very central issue for 16 months, the 911 tape, the question of whose voices on that,\nthat isn\'t going to go anywhere with this judge. So, whenever their rationale is for seeking a delay, I would be astonished\nif the judge buys this particular excuse.\n \n\n SHARPTON: But Paul, why do you think, I see you nodding, why is this important in the trial if this in fact is Trayvon\nand the jury believes this to be Trayvon, what does this do in terms of the evidence in the trial?\n \n\n HENDERSON: Well, this tape and that audio recording is going to be almost the linchpin to define how both sides see\nwhatever happened that evening. Right? So the prosecution is going to say that you can hear him screaming, Trayvon, trying\nto get help and yelling out. The defense does not want that key evidence to come in because that kind of colors the whole\nbasis that the prosecution is making their claims on and so they will do anything they can to diminish, to modify or to delay\nthat evidence coming in.\n \n\n And even if all they are able to do is throw out the prosecution\'s witness and have them choose a new expert, it\'s one\nmore delay, one more modification, one more thing that may diminish",0.3419166759434487,2013-05-24

CAROL LIN, CNN ANCHOR: So Rocky is a Siberian tiger cub who lives in New Jersey, far from his native habitat. COLLEEN MCEDWARDS, CNN ANCHOR: And Rocky has been abandoned by his mom, but he is making the most of the situation. And so is Jeanne Moos -- ""Making the Moost of it."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): You'd feel like hitting the bottle too if your mom shunned you. KAREN YUCHINSKI, SIX FLAGS WILD SAFARI: Here we go. You got it. MOOS: Three-month-old Rocky lives at the Six Flags Wild Safari in New Jersey, one of those drive-through animal parks where your car can end up festooned with baboons perched on your mirror chewing gum. But Rocky had a problem that must have left him feeling like Babe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""BABE"") BABE: I want my mom. (END VIDEO CLIP) MOOS: In this case, Rocky's mom gave birth, then left her cub on the concrete floor. YUCHINSKI: She just went through that door and she didn't look behind her. MOOS: Meet Rocky's new mom. YUCHINSKI: He thinks I'm mom. But what's a cat's concept of mom -- you know, milk, right? MOOS: Actually, a combination of milk and liquefied meat. The park's education coordinator, Karen Yuchinski, bottle fed Rocky every four hours. At least she didn't have to worry about diapers. YUCHINSKI: And at home, he's paper-trained. MOOS: During the day, Karen brings him back to the park. Where else would Rocky get to socialize with a llama? In the movies, it's usually the animals who end up raising orphaned humans, from ""Tarzan"" to ""The Jungle Book."" Humans likewise make goo-goo eyes at Rocky. Do you cuddle? YUCHINSKI: Yes. Yes, we do. MOOS: Rocky acts like a kid. YUCHINSKI: I know. I know. I know. MOOS: He gets into mischief. He's untying your shoes. YUCHINSKI: That's fine. MOOS: We learned that tiger baby teeth are sharp. YUCHINSKI: And I love her to death. She is like the best. MOOS: Ah! All that action. Whoa! But just as in ""The Jungle Book""...

YUCHINSKI: Ah, oh, look out tiger kill. This is his favorite toy. This is a striped orange animal. He had a recognition with this immediately. MOOS: Doesn't Rocky realize you don't have stripes?

It may be that he knows important details about the case. It remains to be seen why he\'s coming back.\n \n\n MATTHEWS: Let me go to Pat Korten.

Just, there was something unforthcoming\nabout them, especially Mr. Ramsey. Tell us what your view was, representing them at the time of these perceptions.\n \n\n PAT KORTEN, FMR. RAMSEY FAMILY SPOKESMAN: Well, in the first place you\'ve got it wrong in one important respect. They\ndid talk to investigators.\n \n\n MATTHEWS: Well why did it seem like they were evading them all the time?\n \n\n KORTEN: They insisted on talking to them together, rather than separately and that is certainly their prerogative. They\nwere not charged with any crime. But the important point to realize here is that they are innocent. They did not commit the\ncrime. And they were unfairly ...\n \n\n MATTHEWS: Well, what -- OK. Fair enough. Well, you don\'t know.

2442114,2766481,NBC News,The Ed Show,"VIDEO CLIP) SCHULTZ: Let`s bring in Kelli Goff, political correspondent for TheRoot.com. And also with us tonight, Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis. Kelli, you first, the war on women. I mean, these remarks by Mourdock have continued to erode away. How big of an impact is it going to have on these races? KELLI GOFF, THEROOT.COM: Huge. It already is, right? And I think the way I look at this, Ed, is the perspective of the GOP was that this election cycle was essentially about three issues: the economy, the economy, the economy. And that is partially true, right? But you could be the brightest economic and business mind on the planet, and if you are running for office and you say something like, I kick puppies in my spare time, I like Adolf Hitler, I hate black people, people aren`t going to vote for you. I think what a lot of the men in the GOP underestimated is, in the eyes of a lot of Americans, making crazy insulting comments about rape falls along those lines. And people aren`t going to vote for candidates, even if the economy is their number one issue, when they`re making these crazy comments. SCHULTZ: Michele Bachmann seemed to have a hard time splitting away from Richard Mourdock`s comments. GOFF: Because she agrees with him, right. But she doesn`t want to say that out loud because she has seen what happens when you actually say that out loud. So they can`t get away from this issue. It has become the albatross around the neck of every Republican candidate. And that`s what we`re seeing. And let`s not forget the other too that a lot of voters don`t care for, Ed, is hypocrisy. And one of the Republican congressman we didn`t hear mentioned is Scott Dedarlis. I might have been mispronouncing his name, but you know exactly who I`m talking about. He was the pro-life, Tea Party candidate who was caught on tape pressuring his girlfriend to get an abortion, right? Meanwhile, he`s trying to make it -- the procedure illegal for rape victims. So voters don`t care for this sort of nonsense. And that`s what we`re seeing. By the way, his race is tightening. He`s an incumbent and his race is tightening as well. SCHULTZ: It is. Chris Kofinis, it is interesting that in different parts of the country, the most aggressive people on the president are having trouble winning re-election. West in Florida. King in Iowa. Walsh in Illinois. And Bachmann, of course, is in a tight race in Minnesota. What are we seeing here? CHRIS KOFINIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think what you`re seeing is this kind of growing, you know, desire among the American people to move away from basically blow torch politics. And there is -- I think there is something that has been happening now in two cycles, in particular in the Senate races. There were three races last cycle during the midterms, Colorado, Delaware and Nevada, where Republicans arguably could",0.1721866096866097,2012-11-02

The Blackhawk like this one was on a routine mission in Iraq when it began to experience transmission problems. It was forced to make an emergency landing in hostile territory. There were 14 U.S. and Iraqi troops on board. LT. COL. CHRIS CALLAHAN, U.S. ARMY: We made a conscious decision to land the aircraft because eventually it would become unflyable if the transmission seized. BLITZER: The 14 troops were quickly joined by reinforcements to guard the helicopter and its sensitive technology. CNN has obtained this nightscope video from the U.S. military, pictures that captured the recovery of the Blackhawk during a complicated and dangerous operation. CALLAHAN: So what we ended up doing was putting together a mission where we would use one of the CH-47s, which is the Army's heavy-lift helicopter, to come in and literally pick it up off the ground and fly it back up here to the lot. BLITZER: You can make out the much larger CH-47 helicopter lifting the damaged Blackhawk and literally carrying it back to the Balad Air Base, a flight that took about an hour and 15 minutes. CALLAHAN: And I used what we call a long line, and they hooked it and very gently picked it up and brought it back. BLITZER: The operation had to be carefully rehearsed. And a separate unit of commandos was sent in to secure the area. They were backed up by Apache attack helicopters, from which these pictures were taken. CALLAHAN: And then what we see on the camera film, we see two snippets. Specifically, one is just simply the enormous length of the rope and how it flies, and then one is, as it comes in to touch down, where the crew did a real nice job of, between the ground crew and the flying crew to set the aircraft back here on its, you know, right side up, and no further damage, you know. And that was good news. BLITZER: The mission was successful. Helicopter pilot Zane Zanenghi was on that Blackhawk when it made the emergency landing in dangerous territory. He's keeping an audio diary of his tour of duty for his hometown radio station. Here is his dramatic account of waiting to be rescued. ZANENGHI: We're still here, and right now we're waiting on a Guard team, which is the maintenance team, to try to determine what they're going to do with the aircraft, try to get us out of here. But it was the real deal today. And it still is the real deal. But I just felt like I should get some audio. It's still kind of reeling through my head. And my anxiety is still way up.

But interestingly enough, despite the Clint Eastwood factor and his political donations to Republicans, he also gave to Democrats, and so even the most, quote-unquote, ""conservative"" movie was on the left side of the spectrum, as far as the people who worked on that movie. HARLOW: But can I -- let me ask you this. OK. Honestly, when I saw this, I was like, how much credence can we give this? Because it goes back and it looks at people's political donations like for Bradley Cooper, the last political donation it has was from 2000. I mean, how much can we really read into this? MOODY: Well, that's just one person. There's dozens of people who work on movies. And a lot of the donations were from 2012, quite a few people who worked on these movies gave to President Barack Obama or they gave to campaigns in California, where a lot of them live. Brad Pitt, he gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to support the pro-gay rights movement in California. So yes, there are some that go back quite a ways, but also you can tell a lot from a person over time to see their donations over several years. You wouldn't want to look at one cycle, because views can change over time. So I think having a nice, a long sample is really -- really is helpful. HARLOW: It's really interesting. Go to CNN.com, read the piece. You can sort of see the spectrum. It has all the movies listed there instead of the blue to the red. And as you said, most of them were on the blue side.

There's absolutely been an erosion in their credibility time and time again. We've seen this where they issue a statement that then later proves to be false. So I do think everything they say or do does require that scrutiny and does require that microscope. And, you know, moving forward, I think it's reasonable that journalists are, you know, putting that scrutiny on the White House. STELTER: Yes. I think they can -- they can answer some more questions and perhaps provide doctors to talk about why he's doing this annual physical early. Dan, does this remind you of anything from past presidents? RATHER: It does. When the Watergate news was really tightening on Richard Nixon (INAUDIBLE). He leaked out that he had an examination for flu virus in his way. It right at the moment when history was catching up with him, when truth were closing in on him, and he had this strange flu virus incident which they leaked out was an obvious effort to get sympathy. That was in Nixon's time. With President Trump, you've hit it right on the head. The Press Secretary can't argue about, well, listen, take us at word when she and the rest of the White House, including the President himself, have been so untrustworthy, so loose with the truth, and opposite of the truth.

California Federal opened close to 100 of its branches in California and Nevada for convenience and to reassure anyone with concerns about Y2K problems. So far, no major problems reported by any federal banking agency. Bankers from coast to coast have spent their new year's in command centers monitoring offices worldwide, making sure all systems are go. Here at Union Bank of California, they've spent $50 million on Y2K. The entire industry spent as much as $10 billion, and it apparently paid off. The biggest concern, of course, was hoarding. The Federal Reserve printed piles of extra currency, about $225 for each man, woman, and child in the U.S., so banks would have enough cash.

In fact, the question of HIV- AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria is an issue that's been embraced by many members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike. They all would be becalmed to this meeting. Again, there's no way to cover up existing charges. So it is ludicrous to think that a meeting like this could do so. And, certainly, it is not exclusive to race because Mr. Jackson's fans, if you will, or people who have grown up on his music, whether in the United States or around the world, are probably one of the most diverse audiences you have. The question here is to take up the challenge that Mr. Louis (ph), the U.N. envoy has given to us, that we can't hide any longer away from the fight on AIDS. We cannot hide from millions of others dying from AIDS and tuberculosis and malaria. Mr. Jackson is ready to put himself forward doing something like ""We Are the World,"" bring in other entertainers. I would say we need to take up this opportunity, begin the planning right now. BLITZER: And remind our viewers, what has Michael Jackson done to try to fight AIDS in Africa? Has he given money, has he organized concerts, has he been there? What exactly has he done? LEE: He has. First of all, this award will be given because Mr. Jackson was touted as the entertainer who has given the most amount of money to charity, upwards of $50 million. But in Africa in particular, he's provided resources for child immunization, hospitals and health clinics. He's been to South Africa. We would hope he would diversify his portfolio and visit some of the smaller countries. And we're very pleased with the diversity of countries that will be represented this afternoon with the ambassador corps, Uganda, Mozambique, and many others who are devastated by the HIV virus. Let me also say that this is not something that has not hit the United States very hard. In the minority population, in particular, we know that HIV-AIDS has been the number one",0.1775938502169401,2004-03-31

We have a strong economy before you tried to disrupt us and bring the horror and devastation of September 11th, and we're going to have a strong economy after we bring you to justice, too.

The former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean charging yesterday on CNN that the decision to raise the terror threat level may have been an effort to help President Bush politically. Here is some of what he said yesterday with Wolf Blitzer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOWARD DEAN, FMR. VERMONT GOVERNOR: I am concerned that every time something happens that's not good for President Bush he plays this trump card, which is terrorism. His whole campaign is based on the notion that I can keep you safe, therefore in times of difficulty for America stick with me. And then and out comes Tom Ridge. It's just impossible to know how much of this is real and how much of this is politics, and I suspect there is some of both in it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: Howard Dean's remarks quickly denounced by the Democratic senator Joe Lieberman yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE LIEBERMAN (D), CONNECTICUT: I don't think anybody who has any fairness or is in their right mind would think that the president or the secretary of homeland security would raise an alert level and scare people for political reasons. That's outrageous. (END VIDEO CLIP) HEMMER: Now the Kerry campaign rejecting any suggestion that the terror alert might be hyped in a statement from a senior adviser released yesterday, saying in part now, and quoting, ""John Kerry and John Edwards will bring all aspects of our nation's power to crush al Qaeda and destroy terrorist networks. No matter what threats we may face the terrorists will not divide us."" That statement from the campaign.

Yes, you can make the case if you remember the Great Recession at the beginning of the Obama administration, the country is in a much better place. But you can find a lot of pockets in there, mostly in these big blue swing states where people, even if the numbers are a little better, they don't feel it. Their legs are tired. They've been through so much. Can Trump and Pence turn this around in these big blues? RESTON: I mean, I think that clearly you talk to voters in those states and they are not feeling the numbers that they're seeing on the economy. They're talking about friends and neighbors who are having to string together two jobs to make what they were making before. They feel like that, you know, the country has never really quite recovered since the recession. And he clearly does have a real gift in terms of reaching out and connecting with those voters and that's why, as Jeff was saying, the Clinton campaign is so worried.

You know, we're getting -- we have, you know, dopes, essentially Donald Trump says the people running our government is stupid. They cut bad deals. I'll rip up NAFTA. I won't do TPP. She's against TPP now, the Transpacific Partnership. But she really isn't. He's questioning her authenticity. You mentioned the Sanders voters. They're trying to make a populist appeal to people who think this town and New York essentially screw the little guy of every opportunity. ZELENY: No doubt one group in Michigan that the Democrats there are working hard. The Arab Americans in Dearborn, Michigan. This is a group of electorate that's grown since the Reagan Democrats and they are offended and turned off by Donald Trump. So if she wins in Michigan, which most people still believes she has an advantage in Michigan. KING: Right. ZELENY: I mean, he is more competitive. It is because of the diversity of Michigan so I think that that is a huge problem for Trump there. Given all the things he's been saying. HENDERSON: Yes. It goes to the fact that in many ways he has been more of a cultural populist than an economic populist. But you imagine, if they would have picked up -- I mean, as far back as 2012, that race between Romney and Santorum, I mean, Santorum was the one to started to pick up on this idea of populism, and he talked about his dad working in the coal mines.

Should we take this announcement as an indication that that review is completed, or is this just a one-off instance, specifically pertaining to UAE? PSAKI: So as you said, and for people who are not totally as familiar with this issue as you are -- I know there's a lot going on in the news. Shortly before the inauguration of President Biden, the United States lifted a 10 percent existing tariff under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act on aluminum imports for the UAE. His campaign promise included a commitment to carefully evaluating all steps taken by the previous administration on trade, as you also said, including the private deals and assurances that may have been made. As part of its campaign commitment, we are conducting an immediate review. So the review is under way of the previous administration's trade policy to determine what steps need to be taken. So that includes, you know, decisions on tariffs, and you know, the previous administration's decision to lift the existing tariff on the UAE under Section 230 at the last hour -- was made clearly in our view on the basis of foreign policy policies unrelated to trade. So it's all part of the ongoing review. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Thank you, Jen. PSAKI: Great. Thanks, everyone. See you tomorrow. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: All right, Jen Psaki there finishing up the White House press briefing, as it is clear at this point in time that the White House is not bending, that President Biden is not bending on the large price tag that he wants on that COVID relief package. I do want to bring in Kaitlan Collins, Dana Bash, and our CNN Espanol anchor, Maria Santana, to be with us. Kaitlan, to you first. They appear to be proceeding, Democrats do, without Republicans on this. And despite meeting with Republican Senators, it is very clear that the White House says $1.9 trillion it is. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they don't seem any closer to an agreement or to what that Republican package was, given it was less than a third of what Biden had actually put forward. Because she said President Biden does stand by that $1.9 trillion price tag of his bill. That compares to the one the 10 Republican Senators brought him, which was a lot closer to $600 billion. Of course, that's a lot smaller. There's a big gap between those two. Brianna, it's not even just she stands by the price tag. It's also what's included in Biden's proposal, which is that federal minimum wage, stimulus checks that some Democrats, some centrist Democrats have agreed with some Republicans, are not targeted enough to certain families. She said he still does believe that certain families should be able to get that. That's going to be a big question moving forward because we're already",0.3678780284043442,2021-02-02

And now we know that the Ukraine President seen to view Mr. Giuliani as some kind of authorized entity acting under color of authority of the President that may or may not have concerned the State Department. So, what do you want to know from them? ENGEL: Well I - I - I want to know exactly what - what they've seen or heard the President do. Look, when you talk about Rudy Giuliani, he wasn't working for the government. He's the President's private lawyer. And-- CUOMO: But he says the State Department asked him to go. ENGEL: Right. CUOMO: Do you believe that? ENGEL: No, I don't. And I think it's mixing apples with oranges, and trying to make it look good, but it really isn't good. You know, you - you would think that given all the hoopla about Russian interference in the previous Presidential election that the President would be very careful this time around, and not use, or try to use, foreign leaders, but he apparently learned nothing.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) VAUSE: Perhaps it's just human nature, but with the passing of time, we tend to settle on an agreed narrative about some of the most defining moments in history, essentially a headline with no detail. Like this iconic image of courage and defiance by a lone protestor in Tiananmen Square. Yes, he stopped the tanks, but at the time the tanks were actually leaving the square. This photograph of a passionate kiss between a sailor and nurse would become a symbol of joy and celebration after the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II.

SCIUTTO: No question, also information to prevent a similar thing going forward. Max, you're in Paris where the plane took off from. We know that more than a startling number, 85,000 workers in Charles de Gaulle Airport there in France had access to secure areas where this plane might have been parked before takeoff. Are authorities tracking down those individuals? Can they track down a number that large and vet them at this point? MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The issue we've been told is that until Egypt causes a terror investigation and a terror related incident, then that sort of terror level of investigation can't be spot here either because Egypt is very much leading on this. But as you say, a huge amount of pressure on the French authorities to start looking at whether or not there was a weak point here, a weak link in the chain at Charles de Gaulle Airport because this is where the aircraft sat for an hour-and-a-half before it sets off to Cairo. Was it sabotaged? Was something he put on the plane? Could one of those 86,000 people who had access to the secure areas here but planted something on there? These are extraordinary claims, but families want to know the answers. So, the families of the passengers, the French passengers on this jet, will meet with government officials today, also with aviation officials, they will know if this airport is secure, and concerns were heightened today after an interview on CNN where a former CIA director said, he would think twice about traveling from this airport. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES WOOLSEY, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: I think I'd think twice about it. But and especially during the forthcoming soccer championships. I think I'd be worried about it. I might still decide to do it. I just got back from flying to Europe not long ago. But it's something that people should start thinking about. (END VIDEO CLIP) FOSTER: This is sort of speculation, Jim, that the French authorities want to keep a lead on this. It's not what they want out there because they don't people put off from travelling here, of course, and they want some firm evidence to present to the families as well, and they have not got that yet.

So if you're pushing on some of the Republican senators, I wondering how you're doing that because we've heard pushes from other Democratic lawmakers primarily in the House at this point suggesting that if, you know, Biden wins, if the Senate turns over to Democrat majority come November, that Democrats should just expand the number of Supreme Court justices. You have tweets like this from Congressman Joe Kennedy, III. ""If he holds a vote in 2020, we pack the court in 2021."" Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler tweeted something similar. Is that the plan? VAN HOLLEN: So, Ana, our focus right now remains on trying to stop this abuse of power right now, to try to get another two Republican senators who will not want to face the wrath of their constituents. Obviously, relying on people like Lamar Alexander, who some thought might want to retire with some dignity. Obviously we can't be counting on that. At the end of the day -- CABRERA: So who are you counting on? Who are the other two who might join Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski? VAN HOLLEN: Well, there are still -- there are, of course, are number of Republicans, who again, have not weighed in on this. There are a number of key states like Cory Gardner. Again, I'm not banking Cory Gardner, but he's in a very, very tough race right now. And he cannot win without independent moderates voting for him. So look, again, Ana, what I'm saying is we will use every procedural opportunity. We are calling on the American people to weigh in. If somehow they abuse their power and ram this through, then obviously we will consider all the alternatives available to us. But right now we remain focused on trying to stop this abuse of power to strip away the Affordable Care Act, to take away women's rights, to take away worker's rights. CABRERA: Okay. Here's what Joe Biden said last year. He said, no, I'm not prepared to go on and try to pack the court, because we'll live to rue that day. And I guess, Biden's whole candidacy, as you know, has been based on this notion he's going to return the office of the presidency to some kind of normalcy, that he would be a uniter, not a divider. So when you say all options are on the table and you're, you know, prepared to take these further actions if you can't convince Republicans to stop, you know, moving forward with a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court, doesn't that openly contradict what Biden is trying to sell?

George Will and his inimitable George Will style putting it all out there. And, Marc, listen, I know this is awkward for you to, you know, have to comment on your former boss for whom you were press secretary, but do you take any of George Will's points that George Will isn't alone, that some people have seen the vice president as being a tad obsequious?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) Developing overnight, President Trump activating the National Guard in the three states that have been hit hardest by coronavirus: New York, California and Washington. It comes as governors across the country plead with the federal government for supplies. Joining us now, Dr. Daniel Varga, chief physician executive at Hackensack Meridian Health, New Jersey's largest hospital system. He is leading their medical response to coronavirus. Also with us, Arlene Van Dyk, a critical care nurse at the Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey; and CNN national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem. She's a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. And Juliette, I want to start with you with the news of calling in the National Guard for these three states. What exactly does that mean and what can they do? JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: So it means that their -- essentially, their status has changed from what's called state active duty, which is the governors control them and tell them what to do and pay, to what's called Title 32. It is just a way for the governors still to be able to utilize them, so they're not under Trump or the secretary of defense. But the feds pay. And generally, the status is when there's a national crisis or national security crisis. We used this after 9/11 when the National Guard was used to protect airports. So it's a -- it's just a money shift. It actually relieves the burden on the states. It's good that it's -- that it was extended to those three states. But President Trump probably should prepare to extend it to all 50 states so that governors can begin to get their National Guard ready, building things, preparing, helping with logistics, supply chains. All the things that the military is really good at doing, simply to relieve the stress on public safety and public health that are under tremendous stress right now because of patients. BERMAN: Erica. HILL: -- what's still to come. Dr. Varga, as you look at this and you're working on your preparations, how are you trying to game out this timeline so that you can make sure you're prepared all the way through? DR. DANIEL VARGA, CHIEF PHYSICIAN EXECUTIVE, HACKENSACK MERIDIAN HEALTH: Well, I mean, right now the four biggest areas are clearly going to be testing, masks and supplies, and making sure the supply chain is there. Staffing is a really big issue very soon and then also capacity management. We're right now at critical levels relative to the timing of getting tests done; relative to our access to masks. We have probably three to five days of N-95 masks left. We're already reinstituting all sorts of different types of staffing models to be able to kind of stretch the highly-skilled nurses that we have right now across",0.0122524052065648,2020-03-23

But also, this is a dignified way of handling it because he won't, I hope, be, so to speak, be unseen. What we will be seeing, I'm sure, in state occasions (inaudible), certain occasions which are very special to him and the queen - and don't forget his platinum wedding anniversary, 70 years, since 1947 to the queen in November. I'm sure we'll be seeing him then. SOARES: Yeah, and of course, Richard, our viewers will know we've been mentioning all this morning that he's, of course, a patron, a member, a president of than 780 organizations, or so. He will be standing by them, not appearing publicly of course. But talk to us a bit about what happens in terms of the workload. How will that be spread? FITZWILLIAMS: The workload will be spread because the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Kate, will be returning to Kensington Palace, making it their official base. They're currently in Admiral Hall (ph) where William is a pilot. And this will be in the summer. Prince Harry will be taking on more, possibly Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall. The royal family spread around, 4,700 engagements. And the fact that Prince Philip is attached to 680 organizations, patronages, it is almost super human what he's managed to do over the years. He's now earned a step back whilst others take up. And it is royal patronage is very, very considerably valued. But it's an amazing career that Prince Philip has had. And I must say, looking back from the war years also to the career he would have liked to in the navy, to have supported the monarch and also the institution of monarchy and the way he has, it's been truly phenomenal. And he's, of course, as you know, got his characteristic idiosyncratic style of doing so. SOARES: And of course, Richard, on that, his style, we've got examples here. He's very well known for his colorful comments. He's credited as saying I declare this thing open, whatever it is, on a visit back to Canada back in 1969. And he said, you know, when a man opens a door for his wife, it's either a new car or a new wife. This is him talking about marriage. And e finally he said, I wish he'd turn the microphone off. And that was as he watched a performance by Sir Elton John in 2001. Media of course will miss him terribly for these comments as will the British public. FITZWILLIAMS: Well, you're absolutely right. But something else may come out of this, too, because some of the quotes, the quips that you've just mentioned, they've had people laughing or sometimes rather infuriated over the years, but they've tended to detract from the serious nature of so much of what he does, the Duke of Edinburgh Awards scheme which has helped millions,",0.9634534525016902,2017-05-04

Put in human terms, 180,000 people contract the disease, that's 60,000 of them who don't have to. BATTISTA: So how many studies are you actually basing your information on, just the one? FRIEDRICH: No, no, all of them. And in fact, in the ""British Journal of Cancer"" earlier this year, the World Cancer Research Fund distilled the evidence from all of the population studies and said that the link is absolutely clear. At Oxford University earlier this year, they did yet another clinical study and they came out with, the more dairy products you consume, the higher your rate for prostate cancer. And again, the American Cancer Society when they're talking about all types of cancer say that diet causes as much cancer as does smoking, and their top two recommendations are eat plant-based foods and cut back on high fat, especially animal foods, so that's very important for people to realize. Of course, we also want to talk about the animal cruelty involved, the fact that these cows are treated like milk machines, they're pumped full of hormones, they're shipped to the slaughterhouse at a fraction of their natural lifespan, and every single one of the veal calves who is slaughtered in this country every year, every single one of them comes from dairy cows. Cows give milk for the same reason humans do, for their babies. BATTISTA: And that is largely the agenda of PETA, we might add. FRIEDRICH: Sure. BATTISTA: Let me bring in Dr. Gilbert Ross, who is executive director and medical director of the American Council on Science and Health. Dr. Ross, Bruce just quoted a bunch of studies there. I mean, is there a link between prostate cancer and dairy products? DR. GILBERT ROSS, AMERICAN COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND HEALTH: I've reviewed the data on this extensibly. There are some studies that link in a slight way the consumption of animal fats and dairy products to prostate cancer. There are many other studies which refute such a link. So I would say the body of scientific evidence is not in on that fact yet, and I think that Mr. Friedrich overstated the case against the dairy products substantially. BATTISTA: So the bottom line is we really don't know if there's a connection, so if we accept that, is PETA necessarily wrong to warn people that there might be a connection? ROSS: Well, no, I wouldn't say that they are wrong to warn people that there might be a connection, but everything is a risk. We could warn people about potential connections -- if you do enough studies on enough potential dietary and nutritional factors, looking at enough cancers, by statistics alone you'll find some links with a number of them, which will not be borne out by further rigorous studies.

If I remember correctly, as a member of congress, he was not as successful as he would have liked have been on many fronts except when he had a working super majority of 60 democratic senators and even then fell short on many legislate efforts. BALDWIN: But even now know you have republican-controlled, you know, senate, house and that a republican in the White House. Let me ask - let me ask you one more and then I'll let you go.

Beyond that, the most controversial part of this is what the White House is advocating that states should put into effect.

SCHNEIDER: Well, Americans do feel that use of force was justified. President Obama has talk about how a country can't just sit by and watch its territory being hit by missiles, in this case, missiles and rockets coming from the Gaza. But when asked, do you think Israel was justified in taking military action against Hamas and the Palestinians in the area known as Gaza, 63 percent of Americans said they thought Israel is indeed justified. That's a 2-1 margin. Thirty one percent said they thought Israel is not justified in taking that kind of military action. When asked, do you think Israel has used too much force in its military action, there you see 38 percent, a little under 4 in 10 say, yes, they think there has been too much force. But if you add together the number that says about right or too little, you have a solid majority saying Israel's use of force was in fact justified.

And number two, he was too close to the car. What he is saying is that he was -- he did not do whatever his training told him to do. HOUCK: His position had nothing to do with it, Don. Nothing at all. No matter where he was, although his tactics might have been not what I would have done, but it still is the fact a car stop, and something like this here, that officer probably felt he was in a good position at that time. That -- it is not against the law and it's not against the department of regulation to have bad tactics. Police officers have bad tactics all the time. All right?

In an effort to do damage control, Bush campaign manager Joe Allbock (ph) called one of McCain's top aides to say ""The Times"" selectively quoted Bush, leaving out the positive things he said about McCain. But McCain's they are looking for a commitment from Bush to incorporate at least part of McCain's campaign finance reform proposals into the Republican agenda this fall. In a speech in Illinois, Bush offered an olive branch of sorts to McCain. BUSH: I appreciate the hard campaign that John McCain waged. He ran a good race. He highlighted the need for reform, and I appreciate the ideas that he brought forth in the campaign. Of course, he and I agree on a lot. And it starts with this: The best reform for America is to end the Clinton-Gore era in Washington D.C. (APPLAUSE) KARL: And Bush's advisers they are serious about winning McCain's support. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to work very hard behind the scenes with Senator McCain's staff, with Senator McCain's advisers, with Senator McCain. We want to unify our party.

And fairly or unfairly, whether the quotes are selective or not, Governor Bush comes across as a little bit petulant and resentful of McCain's success. He needs the McCain voters. Governor Bush and the minor Republican candidates together got about 6.5 million votes in the contested primaries. Gore and Bradley together got about 7.2 million votes. McCain got five million votes. They are the prize. They are the swing voters. And I don't really understand why Governor Bush isn't going out of his way.

BALDWIN: -- thanks to CNN.com -- on this Postal worker, Mary Granados, and her twin sister hearing her screams. Horrendous. Juliette Kayyem is joining me now. Thank you so much. Juliette's a former Assistant Secretary for the Homeland Security department. And, Juliette, as I was just talking to Ryan, we actually just got some new information, that a neighbor tells CNN last -- that last month, the gunman threatened her with a rifle because she put trash in a dumpster. She says that he would often shoot into his backyard from a structure on top of his house and go retrieve dead animals. She said that she called the police, and they didn't show up because his house was not on GPS. Again, this is all according to this neighbor, but your reaction to those new details. JULIETTE KAYYEM, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS: So I think that this is going to be inevitable at this stage. I was on earlier pretty critical of the local press conference with the Governor just because I think it's an opportunity to present facts for the public about who he is and what they know so far. So what we're going to probably start to hear is a story much more complicated than this guy woke up one day and decided to shoot a bunch of people. They're always much more complicated than that story. BALDWIN: Sure. KAYYEM: How much interactions did he have with local law enforcement? How many times had he been approached? How many times had neighbors called about him? What are -- the questions surrounding his access to the gun, if he had a criminal record. And, of course, the use of the A.R. weapon. I don't think we have a number yet, but the -- which is -- which is just now basically the mass murder weapon. There's just no other way to describe it, it's used in almost all of these cases. So that's where this investigation is going to go in terms of a determination of motivation and then also, what can we learn about missed clues. BALDWIN: And, you know, you mentioned the A.R. rifle -- and, by the way, that didn't even come out in the press conference. KAYYEM: Yes. BALDWIN: They had to be asked about it for them to divulge the type of weapon that was used. And it's my understanding that here in Texas, you know -- and, again, we don't know if he obtained this, you know, weapon legally or not, but, you know, it is perfectly legal, it's my understanding, in Texas -- KAYYEM: Yes.

So, isn't it time given that he's at the top of every Republican poll, isn't it time for Mr. Trump to rule out a third party run? Obviously, he's winning among Republicans. COHEN: Yes, I don't know why they keep talking about it. Right now -- CAMEROTA: Because he hasn't ruled it out. COHEN: He's leading in every poll that's come out. There's not as one turns around and says, well, somebody else, then he and somebody -- he's lead in every single poll that's out there. He will be the Republican nominee. So, there's no point of even talking about it. All he's asking for, and all he's ever talked about is if they treat him fairly, which they are. He's talked about it over the course of the past weekend. If they treat him fairly, he will rule out. CAMEROTA: OK. As of today, has he ruled out any third party run? COHEN: That you're going to have to ask Mr. Trump. Only he can sign the oath. But he's made it clear if they treat him fairly, he has no intention of doing anything to damage the Republican Party. CAMEROTA: I mean, he has to definitively say one way or another soon, yes? COHEN: According to the Republican Party. CAMEROTA: So you believe today there will be no third party run? COHEN: I do believe that. CAMEROTA: OK. There's a CNN.com article that is interesting about how some GOP strategists are not comfortable with what they believe Trump is doing to the party. In fact, they are looking for ways to perhaps put chinks in the armor. They say that they might even start anti-Trump PACs to have some anti-Trump TV ads. COHEN: What a shocker.

117199,159272,CNN,CNN Live Today,"JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: The U.S.-led attacks on Afghanistan appear to have made a big impact on the Taliban and al Qaeda, but are these apparent military successes enough to prevent future terrorist attacks on the United States? Joining us now with his insight on the war against terrorism is Paul Bremer. He is chairman of the National Commission on Terrorism and a former ambassador-at-large for counter- terrorism during the Reagan administration. Paul Bremer, do you think that the successes that we have seen, which everyone in the administration very pleased about it at this point on the ground in Afghanistan, greatly diminished the ability of Osama bin Laden to carry out future attacks? PAUL BREMER, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON TERRORISM: I think we are on the way to diminishing his capability, because we are on the way to achieving our two objectives. One was to make a real impact and destroy the terrorist infrastructure there, and I think we are starting to see that happen. And the other was to change the government, and I think we are well on the way to changing the government. The Taliban has really been pulled apart. And this will over time obviously degrade al Qaeda's capabilities. Not right away. WOODRUFF: When you say, ""not right away,"" that means that still there could be -- for example, the spokesman at the Pentagon today said there still may be plans in the works, ""in the can,"" in his words? BREMER: Yeah, I think we have to assume that this is a very dangerous period right now, because if you put yourself in bin Laden's place -- and I assume that we did not get all of bin Laden people here when we did our roundup -- he doesn't know how many more days he is going to be alive. He doesn't know if we'll catch him this week or next week, and therefore, he probably has a pretty incentive to try to do something rather quickly now, to show that he is still in the game. So I think we are in a very dangerous period. WOODRUFF: So what should we be watching for? BREMER: Look, one of the things we are getting out of this, which is indicated in the report you just did, is we are getting a real intelligence windfall here. I don't know what else we found in other kinds of houses or safe houses in Kabul or in Mazar-e Sharif or the other places we have now entered, but there must be an amazing amount of intelligence that is coming our way now, some of which we hope is going to lead us directly to bin Laden. And it appears that -- we hope, it sounds like one of his top deputies was killed today in action, and that's a good sign. So we are on the way, we're on the way to victory here.

But another Peterson case, just as scandalous, is already under way in North Carolina. It's the trial of a novelist named Michael Peterson -- that's him there -- who's charged with murdering his wife. There's also a subplot -- rumors that Peterson may have killed a woman in a similar manner in Germany 18 years ago. But this trial has already taken some surprising turns.

That's pretty broad. Basically it's a companionship for other males of legal age. LEWIS: Wolgamott met Mike Peterson over the Internet. He told the jury Peterson agreed to pay him for sex. In an e-mail to Wolgamott, Peterson wrote, ""You're not looking for a relationship and neither am I. We each have lives. I understand we're in a client relationship and I'm paying for the services. No problem. If we get together, I'll pay for the time."" Peterson fidgeted while the former escort talked about plans the two made together. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you all actually discuss what you were going to do when you were to get together on September 5 of 2001? WOLGAMOTT: Yes, ma'am. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And what were you all planning on doing? WOLGAMOTT: Having sex. LEWIS: The defense quickly pointed out the meeting never took place and the two never had sex. Attorney David Rudolf also suggested Kathleen Peterson knew about her husband's sex habits and tried to show they didn't interfere with the marriage. DAVID RUDOLF, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Did Michael Peterson ever do or say anything either on the phone or in an e-mail that indicated that he was not in love with Kathleen Peterson? WOLGAMOTT: To the contrary, in his e-mails, unlike most of my clients, he indicated that he had a great relationship. Most client don't want to say anything about their relationship.

LAUREN HUNTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden, two Oscar nominated performances in a film about one of America's greatest abstract expressionists. ED HARRIS, ACTOR: It's not an art history lesson, you know, not even the dialogue on modern art of any kind. It's really a subjective, emotional journey with this guy. HUNTER: Harris calls his fascination with Pollack an obsession. It took him 10 years to bring the project to the screen. He guaranteed the integrity of his vision by serving as the film's director, his first time behind the camera. HARRIS: Well, the whole directing thing, boy, it was like diving off a cliff. I mean, I made the decision really because I didn't want anybody else to do it. And this whole thing was an intuitive journey on some level. HUNTER: That intuition was backed by very clear ideas of what would work, including Harden's early interpretation of Krasner's voice. GAY HARDEN: She was talking like this. Painter. And she was so like completely one way. So I said, ""Ed, this is what she did."" You know, so I should be -- he said, ""Marcia, you know what? Stop whatever you're doing right now because people have to watch this film and what you're doing is horrible. And don't do anything more."" HUNTER: But what both actors did do was learn to paint, confronting some of the same creative demons that plagued their real- life characters. GAY HARDEN: The feeling of the void and the feeling of emptiness and the feeling of kind of being a failure because you couldn't pick up that paintbrush. You go, ""Da, da, da."" When I guess for a week, there was a Pollack. And for me, there was Ed over there painting Pollack, you know. I felt so inept. HUNTER: Both say there's a creative parallel between painting and acting. HARRIS: When you make that first mark on that blank canvas, why did you do that? Where did it come from? Was it pure? Was it honest? And as an actor when you're working, you try to get to the same place.

And can you break it up and can you work with Republicans to pass something? If they try to shove it through on reconciliation, I don't think that's smart but you know we'll have to wait and see. BLACKWELL: Senator, with the few seconds we have left, what's the case that the president has to make now as we see the COVID numbers going in the wrong direction in Ohio and across the country? TURNER: Well we've got to continue to encourage people to get vaccinated. We are not at herd immunity yet. And we have to get there. And so there are countless organizations working very hard. And I hope that the president continues to push that. We must get there. Quality of life is on the line. BLACKWELL: All right.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): They moved to door to door in my village, collected swabs for testing and gave vaccines to the villagers. Our village is a tribal village and no one visits here. COREN (voice-over): Vietnam is also trying to accelerate its vaccination program, as cases sharply rise there, too. The outbreak in Ho Chi Minh city is so bad that soldiers in hazmat suits hose down the streets with disinfectant. But even as countries across Southeast Asia tighten their COVID-19 restrictions, the virus still seems to be a step ahead. In one of the hardest hit nations, Indonesia, the death toll crossed 1,500 a day for the first time during the pandemic. Singapore says even the vaccinated are impacted. Government data over the past 4 weeks shows vaccinated people made up three quarters of new infections, though they did not become seriously ill. The empty streets of Sydney, Australia, a sign a lockdown is in effect but with cases still rising, some officials say it's not enough. DANIEL ANDREWS, VICTORIA PREMIER: We need a ring of steel around Sydney, so that this virus is not spreading into other parts of our nation. COREN (voice-over): But spreading is what this virus does very efficiently, so much so, the state of New South Wales asked the federal government for more vaccines, a request that was denied. Prime minister Scott Morrison saying it would disrupt the vaccination program for the rest of the country.

But experts believe that the true number is much higher. KOSIK: Anna Coren, thank you. New data from Israel's health ministry suggest the Pfizer vaccine has limited efficacy against the Delta COVID variant. It's 39 percent effective in general but 91 percent effective in preventing severe disease.

2154360,2472489,CNN,Erin Burnett Outfront,"new Inspector General's report out of the Department of Health and Human Services. That report, the name on that report was from the Principal Deputy Inspector General there, Christi Grimm. At one point during the briefing when he was asked about this Inspector General's report, the President said where did he come from, this Inspector General, what's his name. Well, it's not a man, it's a woman. And just to give our viewers a sense of what's in this Inspector General's report, it essentially surveyed hospitals around the country and found critical supply shortages, not just critical supply shortages in terms of treating patients, but also protective equipment for doctors and nurses and so on, which puts everybody at risk at these hospitals. And the President was going back and forth with several reporters essentially saying, well, is this an Obama political appointee. Well, according to miss Grimm's bio on the HHS website, she was appointed by the Trump administration in January of this year and her experience goes all the way back to 1999. So she has served in government for both Democratic and Republican administrations including the current one and you heard the President rip into Jon Karl of ABC News for a moment there. That was totally uncalled for and refer to Jon Karl as a third rate reporter. I've known Jon for many years. He's a terrific reporter over at ABC who has lots of experience and was asking the right questions as were others in the room about all of this. But it just goes back to, Erin, what we've heard for weeks now and that this President is just terribly sensitive when it comes to criticism of the government's response and all of this and how they've been able to manage getting these supplies out to states across the country. It has been a massive failure on the part of this federal government and the President seems to know that and is just bristling and having outbursts anytime a question is asked about this. BURNETT: And Sanjay, just the facts of this, right, so he's slamming his own appointed Inspector General. But the facts are also not in dispute. I mean, it's nice that we have an inspector general's report to tell the American people what they are hearing from the frontlines from doctors and nurses and hospitals. It's not in dispute. This is the reality of what there have been, which is massive shortages of a whole lot of necessary things. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: There have been so many voices, Erin, lately. Frontline workers, people that I talk to on a regular basis, they're telling us the stories, Erin. I know they've told you the stories about having to go in, take care of these patients, not have enough personal protective equipment. I mean, it's as simple as that.

Miss Kraushaar's attorney says his client's claims have merit that are consistent, in his words, of, quote, ""multiple incidents over multiple days that constituted sexual harassment,"" unquote. Now clearly someone is not telling the truth, Mr. Cain or his accusers -- multiple accusers. As GOP strategist Alex Castellanos said today, this isn't just a he said-she said story, it's a he said- she said, she said and she said story. And as Herman Cain was denying everything today, a friend of the other woman who settled with the NRA spoke out. She said her friend told her that -- that just as in Sharon Bialek's alleged encounter Cain angled a job opportunity as he allegedly made sexual overtures. According to this friend, the accuser said it was well known that Cain behaved badly. That accuser so far is staying anonymous. Two have now publicly come forward, and today Herman Cain hinted that there may yet be other allegations by other accusers. He said any and all of them would be untrue. He also said he'd be willing to take a polygraph test while saying in the very same breath, he won't. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: As distasteful as it might be, would you be willing to do a lie detector test to prove your honesty in something like this? CAIN: Yes.

MARIA CARDONA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, she didn't go into the allegations, Anderson, because clearly she didn't want to relive this as she has had to now on an hourly basis, but she did say something very similar to what Joel said, which is that they were sexual harassment gestures and they happened repeatedly. What I can tell you is that when I hired her at the INS she came directly -- COOPER: You hired this woman? CARDONA: Correct.

And Kori Schake, former director of Defense Strategy for the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. Now a Hillary Clinton supporter. David Gergen is also with me tonight. Corey, let me start with you. Trump didn't specifically used the words Muslim band but he said he wants a tax extreme vetting. So, part of the test, that I don't know whether you answer it verbally or on a piece of paper, if you believe in Sharia Law, you are banned. Now, first of all, putting aside for a second, whether a terrorist would be honest about whether they believe in Sharia Law in attempt. There are at least 30 countries, where Sharia Law is, in some way, part of the law of their land. Is this a way of implementing a Muslim ban? KORI SCHAKE, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBER UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH: Yes, I think we should take Donald Trump at his words. What he said in his speech today was that this was an extension of his idea. And it sounds to me like it is. It's hard for me to see how you implement this in a practical way. First of all, as you rightly said, Erin, who is going to give an honest answer to that question if they are a terrorist. But second of all, what do we do about people like Afghan interpreters who were essential to our war effort who might well say yes to that but who are not only, not a threat to our country, they assisted our war effort. It's one more example of Donald Trump's contradictory, you know, the pieces just don't add up to a policy that is going to advance our interest. For example, how do you -- I'm sorry, go ahead. BURNETT: Boris, it's interesting what Kori said, I take him at his words. She said, this is an extension. This isn't changing or pulling back on the Muslim band. It's an extension. It is an explanation. BORIS EPSHTEYN, SENIOR ADVISER, DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN: It is a development of what he originally said back in December. And you start more about his policies, he's talked to his advisers about the policy. The policy now is for deeper vetting. And the test is only part of the vetting process. So, of course, somebody like an interpreter who wants to come into this country, as part of the vetting process, it would be beneficial to this country then potentially -- BURNETT: So, some believe that Sharia Law can come in, but not others?

It's on the north side of the Tigris from the Ministry of Information. It sits right across the bridge from the Ministry of Information.

HARLOW: Almost a record, ever. BERMAN: Almost a record, in fact. All right. Will it happen? Joining us now, CNN chief business correspondent, star of ""EARLY START"", Christine Romans. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: I feel like a broken record, because I am a broken record, because the Dow is breaking records. There have been so many of them, 12 in a row. If it rallies today, it would be 13. That hasn't happened since 1897, when we have 14, 14 records. BERMAN: My Apple stock during that streak was amazing. ROMANS: Yes, exactly, exactly. (LAUGHTER) ROMANS: That was an actual apple on a tree. BERMAN: Yes. ROMANS: This is the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the election. If you can't do the math quickly, almost 2,500 points on the Dow. So, the big 30 stocks in the Dow, there's been broad-based gains in every single industry. It has done very, very well. And we heard this week, Goldman Sachs say maximum optimism is priced in here. We saw a story in ""The Wall Street Journal"" that said there are warning signs flashing. So, let me give a perspective for you. This bull market is the second longest in history. It's not this post-election phase. This has been going on since 2009. 2009, 13 days, a 250 gain. If you matched the longest bull market ever, you still have a long way to go. That was 1987 to 200.0. That was almost a 600 percent gain. So, by one measure there could be a lot to go, and by another measure, it feels a little tired. That's the big debate that's happening overall among market participants. But this has been an amazing rally. Target will be one stock that will not rally today. It had a terrible quarter, warned for a bad year. So, retailers have been the one spot I have been watching here. BERMAN: Minnesota. It's your fault. HARLOW: But they are worried about this border adjustment tax, if this is going to happen and what that -- I mean, the National Retail Board, they are saying 50 percent higher prices for Americans if this goes through? ROMANS: Absolutely. There are other things happening in the retail sector, it was not a great holiday. And, frankly, people are buying more online. There's a real big Amazon-Walmart push here that's been happening that's been really interesting. So, except for the retailers, we have been seeing a run here. But it's really remarkable, isn't it? It's really crazy just to see it. HARLOW: It just reminds me of, you know, what Warren Buffett says, you can't time this market. So, don't try to predict when the bull market is going to end.

1816102,2132090,CNN,New Day Sunday,"Trump's foreign policy speeches as well as helping to facilitate a meeting just two months before the election between then-Candidate Trump and the Egyptian president, both things that seemed well outside the spectrum of a low-level volunteer. Sara Murray, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. PAUL: All right. Let's talk about this with deputy managing editor of ""The Weekly Standard"" Kelly Jane Torrance. Kelly Jane, good to see you this morning. So, we just heard there from Sarah Sanders. Being a volunteer for a campaign doesn't necessarily equate to being disconnected from it. Put into context Papadopoulos' role in all of this. KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": When Sarah Sanders says he was a volunteer for the campaign, I think she is trying to give people the idea that he was some kind of youngster that came in and answered phones or went door-to-door handing out leaflets because I think what a lot of Americans think of when they hear the words campaign volunteer. But let's keep in mind, Paul Manafort, who was for a time Trump's campaign chairman could be said to have been a volunteer because he did that position unpaid and he volunteered his services unpaid. It's clear that he thought he was going to get something else out of it, of course. So, calling this guy a volunteer, I think, is misleading at best. It's clear that he had a lot to do with the campaign. You see him as you pictured him in meetings with the Trump foreign policy team, pretty close to Jeff Sessions who was the head of then Trump's foreign policy team. He was in communication constantly we learned, especially from that ""The New York Times"" piece, over email with people like Stephen Miller who is then a Trump adviser and is now part of the White House. And he was in communications with Sam Clovis, who him for the Trump campaign and actually encouraged him if he wanted to, to go to Russia to meet with people. Although, he said the campaign would not pay for it and that is apparently why Mr. Papadopoulos decided not to go. Sarah Sanders I think is being misleading at best here in trying to portray him as some low-level coffee boy volunteer. He had more to do with the campaign than that. PAUL: All right. CNN political commentator, Errol Louis, is up with us as well. Good morning to you, Errol. I want to read to you from this ""New York Times"" piece that we've been talking about because it seems significant here. First of all, they say the hacking, meaning of Democratic emails and the revelation that a member of the Trump campaign may have had inside information about it were driving factors that led the FBI to open an investigation in July 2016 into Russia's attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of President Trump's associates conspired.

The U.K. used to be the fastest growing amongst the G7 and now growth this year is expected to be about 1.8 percent and will be even less next year. Next year is when the big drop off happens in the U.K. economic growth. Growth slowing to 6.6 percent with the warning of a high debt load over in China. That is the scenario of the world economic outlook. Of course, there are fast growing economies, India being one of them, and others in Southeast Asia that you keep this global level quite high. The IMF's chief economist has warned that prolonged weak growth could fuel populist sentiments that are against international trade and that will hurt the global economy. The man is Maurice Obstfeld. He joins me now from Washington. Maurice, excellent to see you, thank you, sir. MAURICE OBSTFELD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, IMF: Hello, Richard. QUEST: Thank you for joining us. The reason why U.S. economic growth is slowing down and quite precipitously since the spring forecast just a few months ago. Why is the U.S. slowing down? OBSTFELD: Well, Richard, we've seen to rather disappointing quarters so far this year. We do expect some pick up in the third quarter, but we've also had some retrospective revisions by the Bureau of Economic Analysis for early 2016, late 2015, which have also clouded the outlook. We basically see several factors. Surprisingly low productivity growth is one. The low state of business investment, which you just mentioned, is also a factor. And some lingering drag from the dollar is also in the mix. We see better performance in 2017. A bounce back of about two about 2.2 percent growth. QUEST: Why should the U.S. be suffering the slowdown, these deaccelerating forces? On business investment. What is causing that to happen? Is it uncertainty? Is it weakened demand overseas? OBSTFELD: One factor is definitely low productivity. And you'll probably next ask me why productivity is low. It is somewhat of a mystery, but it has fallen throughout the world. Uncertainty is likely the factor. And we believe demand is a big factor, low demand, low investment go together. QUEST: I notice in your comments in the introduction to the WEO, you do elude to this idea of populist tensions as relates to immigration and as relates to trade. How concerned are you that political factors are now well and truly influencing economic outlooks? OBSTFELD: Well, I think we do see a political reaction to the extended period of low growth after the crisis, coupled with, you know, a long term trend toward greater inequality, which has not improved much in many countries. It is a danger that this could lead to international fragmentation. Negative trade policies, break up in Europe, and we're seeing some of the symptoms in the Brexit vote. QUEST: The Brexit uncertainty, we have seen just today, Maurice, the fall in the pound, not surprising, but you are concerned aren't you that the next",0.0827478777663913,2016-10-04

Why are officers putting themselves in what could potentially is a lethal situation and turns out to be a lethal situation? This is just inexplicable to me and I predict that the feds are going to not just investigate, but the feds will end up filing charges in this case. COOPER: Marcia, do they have the right to break down your door to get in to your apartment? CLARK: Well, see that's the thing I was referring to earlier, Anderson. And it is true that when the police get this kind of notice, and they find out that, you know, you've been notified that there's an emergency of some kind they have to confirm. They can't just take his word for it that he's saying go away and he really means it because how do they know someone isn't standing behind the door next to this man with a gun pointed to his head, and forcing him to tell the police to go away. They don't know. They need to see him. I do understand that need. What I don't understand, as Mark is referring to, and I agree, is the escalation. Why, at every bend and turn did it escalate the way it did? Why didn't you talk to the niece? Why not get the niece to talk this man down? Why once you have the door open you've broken it down get the niece to come in and talk to you when you see there's no one there to threaten her. That there's no danger. This man stood there, he was holding a knife but there was no other person there with a firearm. So I don't know why it kept on. GERAGOS: What's fascinating about this is contrast this with the whole discussion that you had on your air over the stand your ground. Here's somebody who's in his house, I mean he's literally in his home. They're busting down the door to get in to his home, he can't use a knife because he doesn't want the police coming in to his home? That's the last refuge of the fourth amendment. COOPER: Well, Lou, what do you make of this? PALUMBO: Well, let me just say this first, you know, I was a police officer and I was in situations like this. And I can tell by the tone and the exchange between the officer and Mr. Chamberlain, the officer was well-intended. I believe he was sincerely concerned for his well-being. If anybody followed the story, they'll understand that at the time this took place Mr. Chamberlain was intoxicated. I think the officers were between a rock and a hard place on this one. You know, one of the things I was curious about is, when the situation like this evolved, did they call for a supervisor, someone with higher authority that could look at the situation and go, you know",0.093307090152516,2012-05-04

So there is a great deal of uncertainty about what will fuel the American economy of the future, but the economy of now seems to have taken one step forward and two steps back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PROF. PETER MORICI, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: If gas stays at $3.50 a gallon, Americans will have a lot less to spend on restaurant meals, iPhones, new cars. In turn that will mean less goods made here, fewer jobs. We could lose a many as 500,000, 600,000, 700,000 jobs from higher gas prices. (END VIDEO CLIP) VELSHI: That's Peter Morici from the University of Maryland. Remember, this recession that we just went through was prompted by a housing crisis, a mortgage crisis, but generally speaking most recessions in the United States are prompted by oil prices. Christine, are these high oil prices and high gas prices a major threat to our jobs recovery here in the United States? CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: When Peter Morici says that if gas prices stay high and continue higher that you're going to see a second recession in the U.S.. But others say wait a second, $3.50, $3.60 for gas prices in the U.S. still hurts, but you're well off the record highs and you're even not as high as the $4 and $4.15 that many people were saying it was going to take to really hurt consumers. So there's that point. There's also something else. People have a little extra money in their pay check and they may not feel it but they do. They have a few extra dollars. I think $40 extra a paycheck and that's from the pay roll tax holiday. So there's a little bit of a cushion there. High gas prices are meaning, but they're not spending the money someplace else. VELSHI: But you're taking exactly the same amount of money -- the same amount of something for more money than you were paying for it two weeks ago. ROMANS: Absolutely. Absolutely, but also, you know, it's causing them to pull back in other places as well. But will it mean 600,000, 700,000 jobs, I just don't think we know yet. VELSHI: Richard, take a look at this poll. I want you to see this, 64 percent of Americans say rising that gas prices cause hardship for them. OK? In Europe, gas prices, much higher. Where you are, in London, much higher. There doesn't seem to be this recurring fear of higher prices of oil resulting in higher price of gasoline, therefore resulting in setbacks to the economy.

We don`t want to -- you know, we don`t want to give him a big success in his first term and they`ve sort of stuck on that for the last three years? WHITMAN: Well, it`s a combination. It`s a combination of the hyperpartisanship we see in Washington that`s been coming for several decades now, getting worse and worse every decade where every issue is looked through the partisan polical prism, not the policy prism, not what we can do to solve this problem but what`s going to get me another vote on caucus and then those who honestly believe that a program like this from the federal government this size, which you know, and we said -- you said, all of the big ones have glitches coming out inevitable.

Actually, it`s worked better than I thought it would. I`ll admit that. But at the time that it was rolled out, there were lots of glitches.

Trump has already said that he would destroy Turkey economically if Turkey crossed an undetermined red line -- we don't know exactly what that is in this offensive -- against the Kurds, the Kurds in northern Syria. And Turkey, in response to criticism that it has been getting from Europe, has in turn threatened to unleash 3.6 Syrian refugees on to Europe basically meaning that Turkey would once again open the gates to the refugee route to Europe from here. Also we've heard even Russia, President Putin saying he was concerned that this Turkish offensive would allow ISIS to -- as we've heard from others as well -- regroup and launch a number of counterattacks and reverse the gains that have been made. Turkey's point in all of this has been very simple and very straightforward. From Turkey's perspective, this is how they see it and this is what their response is. They say we have waited.

ALEX BURNS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: That's certainly the conventional wisdom and certainly, on an intuitive level, Donald Trump is the candidate who is campaigning as the guy who is sort of ringing the alarm bell loudest and playing into people's real fears about domestic terrorism. I do think, in the larger sense, polls have shown pretty consistently that Hillary Clinton holds a small lead on the question of who do you trust more on matters on national security and defense and foreign policy. Trump with a small lead on the much narrower question of who do you trust to handle ISIS. So, I do think there is a question of, you know, on a gut level, people respond to Trump-style appeals to their fears and to their anger. When it actually comes time to vote, there's another question about who do you actually want to have as president? And that's really, I think, the biggest question of the election at this point. Is, you know, do you want the guy who sounds like what's in your heart, or do you want the person who, you know, seems a little bit more conventionally calm in this kind of situation? CUOMO: Well, look, we see certain things every time. The first is that it's easy to get frustrated when you hear people going slow about what seems so obvious. Other than the outlier, where it turns out that somebody is an anti-statist, you know, or anti-government but it has no connection to anything else, people feel like they know what this is. They know what's going on. They want their leaders to reflect their urgency and their anger. So how do you balance that with what may wind up being true, what deliberate speed does for leadership? How do you balance the two? LOUIS: Well, it's interesting. I think the way that we worked it out here in New York is that we have this kind of -- almost, you know, kind of, sadly, a kind of repeated ritual in times of emergency; and this includes natural crisis, as well. You know, sort of storms and floods and blackouts and so forth. You know, we understand that we're going to get the information as quickly as the authorities can get it to us.

MANN: One of the talented people I work with who is on the other side of the camera just said before you came on the air, ""My dog,"" referring to her dog, ""My dog is too dumb to do this."" Were all those dogs particularly smart? Were they unusual dogs? Or were they just household pets that people are used to hitting with newspapers every once in a while? MCCULLOCH: Exactly. They were -- some people have said that it was a very short training time, and we think that's true. Several reasons may be, one, we began with just ordinary household puppies, and a puppy, really, in a household environment grows up in a happy environment and they're very eager to interact with humans and to learn from humans. So that's one possibility as to why they were so good. But, yeah, basically we just had ordinary household puppies with only basic puppy training and no prior professionally run detection training. MANN: Nothing special about the dogs. Let me ask you, is there anything special, do you think, about cancer? Or could dogs smell other diseases? MCCULLOCH: Well, I think that dogs can smell other diseases. I think that's going to be an important question to pursue. I think other diseases, certainly, like diabetes is a well-known example, other diseases do have evidence of their presence in the breath. And so again, really, we're looking forward. What the dogs have done is they've opened the door to a whole new way of looking at diagnoses, and that is can you analyze the breath using either chemical means, like a chemical analysis, or biological means, like the dog, to detect disease. And we don't know yet which one is going to be better. MANN: I don't mean to be flip, but do you foresee a future where there are going to be dogs in every doctors office, in every hospital? MCCULLOCH: Well, one of the questions that we're anticipating is in our collaboration with the chemists and the animal specialists, we're going to be -- in our prior study, the dogs set the bar at the 99 percent level. And now as we collaborate with the chemists, we're basically looking to see can technology reach that bar? Can technology reach that challenge that the dogs have set for us? And so to answer your question there, we're really looking ahead to see in the next phase of our research, where we compare chemistry analysis of the breath and the dogs, what are we going to do with the answer if the dogs were still better. It will basically say that technology still has more work to do. MANN: One last question for you. What happened to the dogs? Are they back fetching people's slippers?

Yesterday we just saw a glimpse of some of those guests, Mitt Romney, Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor, and Charlie Crist, the governor of Florida. Not much though coming out of the McCain campaign although they keep saying this is really just a social gathering, and a way for these Republicans to kind of get together and relax. WHITFIELD: All right. Meantime, while the focus there is in Arizona as it pertains to John McCain, not far from you in the mile-high city of Denver, the libertarian convention is taking place. And we make that segue because there really is a push among the libertarians to appeal to what should be McCain supporters, but perhaps are not. What's taking place at that convention? SNOW: Yes, you know, they're getting a lot of attention because former Republican Congressman Bob Barr of Georgia announced about two weeks ago that he was going to seek the libertarian nomination. And right now the convention taking place. We do -- we could see a candidate emerging later this afternoon, as the party's nominee. There are 14 candidates in all. Bob Barr, though, the most visible. He's also been known as the Republican who was really behind the move to impeach President Clinton. He has been a strong critic of the war. Some of the people, though, in the Libertarian Party say they're critical of him, because they think he might be too conservative. He doesn't see eye to eye on some of the same issues. But he's seen as the best known name among the candidates there. WHITFIELD: Is there a way in which to gauge whether this will in any way impact John McCain? SNOW: Yes, because the question is, will he be able to garner the protest vote with Republicans who are really unhappy with John McCain. And we've seen even in Oregon, recently in the primary there, that even though John McCain is the nominee, Ron Paul got about 15 percent of the vote in that primary. Ron Paul has libertarian views. He ran on the Republican ticket. He garnered a lot of enthusiasm. The big question is, you know, can he really, if Bob Barr is the libertarian candidate, can he have an impact on John McCain? A couple of factors. One, depends on how many states put him on the ballot. Number two, it depends on how close the race is. And that will determine whether or not he'll be the Ralph Nader, so to speak, of this election. Could he be a spoiler and taking away votes from John McCain if the race is pretty close with McCain and the Democratic nominee? WHITFIELD: There you are and you mentioned Ron Paul.

CAMEROTA: And so, David, to be clear, in this exercise that they did just last year, was it highlighted that they would need to manufacture more ventilators, that they would need more surgical masks and more protective gear? Was all of that the upshot of this? SANGER: Well, what's interesting is that at the end of the report, and we only have a draft report. In fact, we don't have any evidence that they finally published this report, which itself is pretty interesting. But in the -- in the draft, they made clear the number of hospitalizations. And so you can move forward from -- from those numbers. They did not specifically mention ventilators. They did not specifically mention hospital beds.

TALEV: Although, if you're Barbara Comstock, it's kind of baked in the cake already. I mean -- and that sort of -- it's like a self- fulfilling prophesy.

And there's some places where that just reminds Democrats and swing voters to don't like President Trump, why they want to turn out, you know, the other way around. Every president in a midterm year craves being as relevant or as important as he is in a presidential year. President Obama went through this also in the second time around in 2014. He'd really hold back. He wanted to be out there, but he was benched in a lot of places. And President Trump has not exercised the same discretion, but so far his instincts about where to go and the places where his team have been able to maneuver him have been pretty smart.

The NTSB determined that sound was a low order explosion, the sound of the plane tearing apart after a fire in the fuel tank, not a bomb. TWA 800 fell out of the sky as other pilots called into the tower. PILOT: We just saw an explosion out here. LAH: All conversation recorded between the crew and the cockpit is protected by federal privacy laws. The actual audio un-releasable because it's sensitive and personal to the victims' families. Goelz says the audio proved critical in the TWA case and other air disasters. In MH-17 the plane shot out of the sky over Ukraine, investigators triangulate a 2.3 millisecond sound peak captured on the voice recorder's multiple microphones in the cockpit and determined the noise came from outside of the plane to the left side of the cockpit. It was a missile launched from the ground. GOELZ: You can sometimes tell the direction in which the sound is traveling by just the tiniest fraction of a second, and you can also sometimes compare this signature of the sound to previous events. (END VIDEOTAPE) BURNETT: I mean, Kyung, you're talking there about a 2.3 millisecond sound. I mean, it is incredible to think about. Obviously, the black boxes have been recovered. Have they pulled any information from them yet, though? LAH: Well, we're talking about two different black boxes. So, the flight data recorder, well, that information has been copied. They are still working on analyzing that data. This is according to Russian investigators. But, as far as that sound and that cockpit voice recorder, Erin, we're being told that there has been some serious mechanical damage to the cockpit voice recorder. They are still working on trying to retrieve the specifics of the data. BURNETT: All right. Kyung Lah, thank you very much. And we'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WHITFIELD: All right. Several big political stories this week. Senator Bob Bennett has lost his bid for re-nomination in Utah. It looks like two other candidates kind of squeezed him out and will face each other in a June primary. Conservatives were pretty angry. I'm going the wrong way. Aren't I? Conservatives were pretty angry about his position on a couple of top issues, including his vote on health care. And then Charlie Crist, you know he was a Republican for a long time. Now he is an Independent and polls are showing that he made a pretty smart political move there. We'll talk about that. And Attorney General Eric Holder says the U.S. Justice Department just might be suing Arizona over its controversial new immigration law. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOLDER: It is certainly one of the concerns that I have that you will end up in a situation where people are racially profiled and that could lead to a wedge drawn between certain communities and law enforcement, which leads to the problem of people in those communities not willing to interact with people in law enforcement, not willing to share information, not willing to be witnesses where law enforcement needs them. I think you have to think about the collateral consequences of such a law, understanding the frustration that people feel in Arizona. It's one of the reasons why I think we have to have a national solution to this immigration problem. (END VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: Obviously there is a lot to talk about. We're going to begin with that very topic Eric Holder was talking about. Jennifer Donahue is with us. She's political director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College in Manchester. Good to see you, Jennifer. JENNIFER DONAHUE, NEW HAMPSHIRE INSTITUTE OF POLITICS: Good to see you. WHITFIELD: OK, let's talk first about Eric Holder and what the probability is of the Justice Department filing suit against Arizona. On what grounds? DONAHUE: Well, I think, basically, what you heard Holder say in the sound bite that you played is that the grounds are humanitarian, that basically, it's racial profiling. And I think one of the problems with that argument, even though a lot of people agree with that argument, and it's actually a split issue, is that in Arizona itself, where there's a huge immigration problem, over 70 percent of the voters actually support the legislation that would allow what Holder considers to lead to potentially racial profiling. And that's the frustration and anger that he's referring to when he says that he understands that Arizonans are frustrated and angry about the current immigration situation, is because there's so much illegal immigration in Arizona that it's created a lot of anger. So how far would the feds go in filing a lawsuit? I think they'd go",0.1700536084879295,2010-05-09

You can always go to our blog at ed.MSNBC.com. We`ll bring you the results later on in the program. I`m joined tonight by Katrina Vanden Heuvel, editor, part-owner of ""The Nation"" magazine. And also with us tonight, Richard Wolffe, vice president and the executive editor of MSNBC.com and an MSNBC political analyst. Great to have both of you with us tonight. I`ve never seen a picture get so much attention, except when Dick Cheney shot somebody in the face, which the president hasn`t done. Katrina, is the press being negligent when we start getting down to the serious conversation of background checks that they`re focusing on stuff like this? KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL, THE NATION MAGAZINE: Yes, I mean, I think we`re looking at inside the Beltway media malpractice. It`s not new, Ed. I`m thinking we`re on the tenth anniversary of Iraq, and the press essentially -- much of the press played stenographers to power, not an accountability watchdog media which we need. This skeet shooting incident has nothing to do, it`s utterly irrelevant with the actual policy proposals now under debate. So you have to ask yourself, who does the media inside the Beltway think it`s representing? We`ve seen these problems before. The country is worried about joblessness. Inside the beltway, the media keeps pushing the president on debt and deficits. I`d like to know also, you think of the fundamental issues confronting this country. But on the gun issue, why isn`t -- why wasn`t there a single question about the 15-year-old Chicago girl, Hadiya Pendleton, who marched in the parade in the inauguration and was gunned down, the 42nd victim of gun violence in Chicago in January? That might be relevant to the issue of how do you stop trafficking of illegal weapons, and relevant to the actual policy debates under way in this country. SCHULTZ: Richard, why does inside the beltway media have a propensity to focus on things that people don`t care about? RICHARD WOLFFE, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Look, I`ve been part of that press corps. I was there in the time in the run-up to the war in Iraq. And, by the way, there were people who were asking those questions. But as a pack -- VANDEN HEUVEL: Yes. WOLFFE: As a pack mentality, this is a game. And, you know, look, the war in Iraq was serious.

The House is going to send something over and you either take it or leave it. But I can tell you right now conservatives are inclined to leave it. MATTINGLY: Led reporters and staff through the capitol building in a very public search for a House committee's draft bill. PAUL: This is being presented as if this were a national secret. MATTINGLY: That's an attack that was quickly echoed by frustrated Democrats. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D), MINORITY LEADER: Republicans are hiding their draft of ACA repeal bill in a basement room. MATTINGLY: They were quick to note the irony, the charges that mirror those levied against their party when the Affordable Care Act was considered in 2009. REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER (R), HOUSE SPEAKER: Look at how this bill was written? Can you say it was done openly? With transparency and accountability? Without back room deals and struck behind closed doors, hidden from the people? Hell no you can't! MATTINGLY: Paul stunt designed to undercut the cautious behind the scenes effort by the GOP to get their own members in line. It drew an immediate backlash from House GOP aides. One called the effort ridiculous, absurd and an absolute circus, but Paul isn't alone in his policy concerns about the bill. From proposed tax credits to ease the cost of plans to Medicaid reforms, no shortage of thorny and potentially lethal issues remain imbedded in the process. The window to get something done, that's only closing. House leader, sources say, telling their members in a closed door meeting this week they want to vote on their plan by the end of this month. PENCE: We expect in a matter of days you're going to begin to see a very brisk pace of legislative activity. We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. We're going to do it at the same time. (END VIDEOTAPE) MATTINGLY: This is an interesting moment if you pay attention to the last six, seven years, how many times have people campaigned on the repeal and replace issue. The action happens now. This is everything they've been pledging to do, but the problems also very real between conservatives, moderates, inside the party. It's not just Republicans and Democrats here and that's I think it's important to note, legislative action is starting, the process is happening, but it needs to happen quickly. There's a finite amount of time Republicans have to start actually moving this through. It's a packed legislative calendar. President Trump has a number of enormous initiatives that he wants to move. This is health care's time, health care's window.

The problem is that sometimes he just can't help himself, that he won't be able to stop himself from doing it. SWEENEY: And in terms of investment, how likely is he going to invest, as Matthew believes in. (CROSSTALK) NEIL: He will put a lot of money. You know, the -- on a straight valuation basis he is paying a lot. You know, everything Rupert Murdoch has bought, he paid a lot. I was with him in '94 when FOX got the rights to the NFL. And everybody said he paid far too much. He paid far too much for the FOX stations. He always pays too much. The way to value this is not what the value is now, but what he can make it. You add in the Murdoch magic, the rest of his paper's business resources. He is now starting what will become The Wall Street Journal financial channel, and his global reach that he has, add all that together and you will have a far more vibrant if rather more politically interesting company. SWEENEY: And journalistically, where do you think he can take the newspaper in terms of investment? Where does it need to improve? Or where would he see it might need to change? NEIL: Oh, he believes that the journal is overmanned. He believes there are far too many journalists not writing enough words. So I don't you will see a huge investment in the print journalism. What he will attempt to do is roll it out more successfully across all the platforms in a digital age. After many wrong starts, Rupert Murdoch finally got the measure of the digital age. And both on satellite, on screen and online, you will see The Journal brand rolled across the world. And he it, for all of his faults, the only true global media mogul. And with The Journal, he gets a truly global brand. SWEENEY: Should we expect redundancies Matthew Bishop? BISHOP: Well, I imagine so. But as Andrew says, I mean, the key point is, is he is good for global business coverage because he will invest in The Wall Street Journal as a global newspaper that really is reporting globally. And for the past few years, The Journal, as has the FT, have been reducing their global coverage to some extent because they have had to be closing bureaus abroad and reducing the number of journalists out there covering the more interesting parts of the world, like China and India, which are really where the business stories of the future are. So I think we are going to have a much better global business coverage as a result of this deal than we would be having otherwise. SWEENEY: There seems to be no stopping him.

This lawsuit came two weeks before Winston could be the number one overall pick in the NFL draft and bagged tens of millions of dollars. The allegations haunted the quarterback through much of his college career as well even though Winston was never charged criminally. Florida State also cleared him of any wrongdoing.

Right now, winds still 215 kilometers per hour, gusting up to 260. Obviously, we've got all the hurricane warnings and even some tropical storm warnings down near the Turks and Caicos. Again, as we continue to expect this. Until it begins really its forward progression. Which is really won't start to do for at least another 24 hours. Then, the storm really picks up speed and begins to slide up towards Canada. Now, forecast accumulations still over the next 48 hours are expected to see around two to 400 millimeters in a lot of those areas. Now, as the storm begins to slide north, we've got this upper low off the coast of Florida. As that begins to shift east, all of this moisture gets funneled into South Carolina, North Carolina, and much of the east coast. So, that's what's really going to dump a lot of the rain. Here you can kind of see that plume just kind of focused right there, just pushing more and more rain into the same areas. And that's why we have a lot of the flood and flash flood watches out. Forecast rainfall amounts. Take a look at Charleston, South Carolina, picking up around 300 millimeters is what it's estimated to pick up. Now, on the other side of the world, we have tropical depression Mujigae. Now, again, now about 65 kilometers per hour. Not necessarily the strongest of the storms, but it will continue to slide to the west and northwest, near Hiko and just south of Hong Kong. Now, as it does, it is expected to dump a pretty significant amount of rain as it begins to slide there. Also, the winds. Even though it will be just slightly south of Hong Kong, the winds and the rainfall estimates are still expected to be quite impressive. Take a look here. Just on the south side of Hong Kong, we're talking about two to 400 millimeters of rain and then the winds, again. That's going to be a big impact kind of in between Hiko and Hong Kong.

And then just as they went back into the jury room for deliberations, another female juror pushed her hair back, wiped her face and went back in there. She was later seen, the first one, wiping her eyes as she went back in just before the verdict was announced. At any time in guilt innocence phase, do you believe the jury talks about the death penalty? MIKE BELMESSIERI, SCOTT PETERSON JUROR: No. No. You know, what they are doing is -- well, they are way too busy focusing on the question at hand, the innocence of guilt of the accused. In this jury`s case here, I lost the pool. I had Friday. But they took their time, and it`s obvious they gave great thought to their decision and took it very, very responsible. The talk about a death penalty at this point in time by any juror is probably just a little bit premature, and I`m sure the jury foreman would probably say no. GRACE: I think you are right.

And now we've obtained exclusively videotape depositions from those lawsuits, and the tapes are a fascinating window into how News America marketing has done its business. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GRIFFIN (voice-over): The hacking scandal in the British tabloid press may seem distant to most Americans, but not to Antonia DeMatto. ANTONIA DEMATTO, FMR. FLOORGRAPHICS V.P.: When the news broke in the U.K., it was a little bit like reliving it. GRIFFIN: The former employee of the advertising company Floorgraphics was floored watching James and Rupert Murdoch try to explain the hacking and espionage that took place at their British newspapers, because she insists it happened at a Murdoch company in the U.S., too. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Floorgraphics has increased the presence of your product beyond your shelf facing. GRIFFIN: Floorgraphics was a fast-growing New Jersey startup that put ads on floors in supermarket and retail outlets. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Win the war, brand the floor. DEMATTO: They were making breakthroughs in the marketplace. And we thought we could build a really fantastic company. GRIFFIN: Floorgraphics was competing with the Murdoch's News America Marketing when DeMatto received this in her mail at home, addressed to her personally, a series of press releases touting how News America was taking away business from her company, Floorgraphics. The releases also went to the homes of her colleagues. Her question then, as now, how did Rupert Murdoch's News America marketing get the names and home addresses of a competitor's employees? DEMATTO: I think the creepy part of it is how they got the information. GRIFFIN: Simple, according to News America Marketing. They had hired a former Floorgraphics sales executive, and that new employee, now a News America marketing vice president, was basically using "" -- the same contact information he used to send cards at holiday time."" And News America Marketing says the company's top manager had no involvement. DEMATTO: The anger-inducing unethical part is how they used it. The absolutely infuriating part is that, apparently, this happened many times, with no one stopping to say, you know, should we really be mailing this out to the people in graphics, to the receptionists? GRIFFIN (on camera): It turns out DeMatto was caught up in a war, a business war declared here at what used to be the Dish of Salt restaurant in Manhattan. In 1999, Floorgraphics founders George and Richard Rebh came here for a business lunch to discuss what they thought would be a future partnership or business arrangement with a potential competitor. They sat down with this man, Paul Carlucci, the CEO of",0.4064522135053021,2011-10-14

I know nobody wants to hear that, but anybody who tries these cases will tell you that.\n \n\n GUILFOYLE-NEWSOM: Right.\n \n\n SHERMAN: They don`t castigate, but they scrutinize the conduct of the victim a lot more closely than any man does.\n \n\n ALLRED: But, Kimberly, my guess is that the prosecution is ready to answer that question, which is, why did she go up\nto the room. Of course, even if she just wanted to go to the room, it doesn`t mean she was consenting to an act of sexual\nintercourse. But my guess is since she was a connoisseur at the hotel, it may have been that the reports are true that Kobe\nBryant called her after she had given him a tour of the hotel and then had left and asked him to come to the room as a part\nof the business service of the hotel that she was rendering. One report said to help him fix his hot tub. I don`t know that\nthat`s true, but there may be a good reason why she went up there.\n \n\n GUILFOYLE-NEWSOM: Well and he`s Kobe Bryant. Don`t forget. I mean this guy`s a huge star, a huge celebrity in his own\nright, and she`s 19 years old. I`m sure she was excited to meet him and then to get an invitation to go up to the room, I\nmean who are we to judge...\n \n\n ALLRED: Well, it may not have been a real invitation, but just a request for assistance...\n \n\n (CROSSTALK)\n \n\n ALLRED: It`s a very high quality hotel and, you know, I`m sure everybody is professional and tries to assist their guests.\n \n\n GUILFOYLE-NEWSOM: Well since this is going to come down to a he said-she said, I think one of the most important aspects\nis going to be the jury selection and getting jurors that are going to be able to get past the idea that just because she\ngoes up to the room or even if there`s an initial sexual encounter, that does not give someone license for rape. Brian, would\nyou agree?\n \n\n WICE: Oh absolutely Kimberly. I mean you know as a veteran litigator and the other two veteran litigators that are on\nthe panel tonight, know that most cases are won or lost when that jury is ultimately seated in the box. And what the ideal\njuror in this case might be, I think Mickey is probably close to the answer. You may want women who, as Mickey said, are much\nmore harsh on victims in this situation. I think that with Kobe`s resources, unlike your typical citizen accused, you`re going\nto see the gurus of jury selection, maybe Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, maybe Robert Hurshorn",0.8491777356103731,2003-08-28

And our experience is when you're trying to do meaningful innovation and bring new product and capability to market, doing it in arm's length contracts is always really, really hard. And so you put these two companies together and now the two companies are working together to change how the customer experiences entertainment. How the customer experiences CNN, literally. That's what we think will change. The customer is demanding not only the entertainment, not only the content, but the ability to integrate social, doing clipping and posting and in social interaction with their content. So these are the kind of things we really want to move fast with. ROMANS: Talk to me more about how you see the future audience consuming this stuff. You know, you've got this young millennial who, in many cases, they don't want to ever have a cable package, right? They're viewing this content differently. How does this deal see that or feed that? STEPHENSON: So, the millennials -- in fact, our customer base in general is not consuming less content. Our customers are consuming more premium content today than they've ever consumed, but they're consuming it in different places. They're not consuming it just on the television in their living room. They're consuming it now on their tablet, they're consuming it on their mobile device on the go, and they're consuming it everywhere. And it's really stark if you look at the amount of volumes, how they're increasing -- the traffic going to these mobile devices that's video-driven. And so, we see that continuing, but we see that if we can actually innovate and curate the content differently and bring it to the customer differently, we actually think this doesn't slow down, this accelerates. And this is the really important thing here because we're really excited about as this accelerates, as this demand for premium content on these mobile devices continues to grow, it gives us more and more incentive to invest more and more in infrastructure -- ROMANS: Right. STEPHENSON: -- and innovate in infrastructure -- this idea of 5G technology. ROMANS: What is that? STEPHENSON: It's the next generation of mobile technology. So think about the fastest internet speed you get from a cable company is a gig, right? That we can -- you can buy a gig of speed. The 5G will allow us to provide a gig of speed to you wirelessly. And as we innovate this kind of content, having a one-gig wireless network so our customers now can stream any kind of content, any kind of video anywhere, ultimately, we think we'll be competing head-to- head with the cable companies with a wireless offer. We can hit those kind of price points, combine it with this kind of content. We think this is exciting.

They didn't eliminate the seven day deadline and when they -- I see my time is up. WELLS: Thank you, Mr. Mardenborough. Mr. Hancock, as I indicated, I think you have three-and-a-half minutes. And I would pose this question to you, and I'd like for Mr. Boies to also respond to it. In Section 5 of Title 3, they specifically refer to contest, in that it's for final determination of any controversy or contest concerning the appointment of electors of such state. Now, under our statute, which is 168, those contests cannot begin, as your opponents say, until such time as the ballots are certified, under its express language. Now, why isn't it correct that we are jeopardizing with each passing day Florida being able to have its votes counted in the Electoral College, if we don't allow the certification? HANCOCK: Because the first -- the 168 provisions do not relieve county officials of certifying election results correctly in the first instance. We know here, from Palm Beach County's situation, as Justice Quince points out, that people have cast ballots that under the laws of this state, opinions of this court, are valid votes; they have not yet been counted. Once that final count is done, then the procedure for contests kicks in. That is a completely different procedure. That places a burden on a plaintiff to prove that the election results are wrong. Again, however, in the first instance, that burden is on the county election officials to certify a correct result. If I may correct, Justice Anstead, Professor Rogow has asked me to correct a statement he made to you. In fact, the Palm Beach County Canvassing Commission did request the attorney general to issue the legal advisory opinion that was issued on the 14th. HARDING: Mr. Hancock, we have -- the chief justice has asked a question, and I don't know whether you want to use your time to rebut your co-counsel or not, but where do we find, from this record, the limits that we are to set in making a determination that we've been asked to say the votes have to be in by a certain time so that the contest provisions can kick in? Where do we find, from what has been filed before us, the wisdom to do that? HANCOCK: Justice Shaw suggested giving that authority to the secretary of state. We would suggest if the court considers that, that the court sets standards. The standards should be that the counties are entitled. And the paramount interest in doing this is to recognize voter intent. The counties should be given all reasonable opportunities to complete the process, consistent with",0.3724366189633917,2000-11-20

So right now though, there seems to be this small army of prosecutors who have gone rogue. Was Donald Trump in a position back in 2017 where he could have closed this all down or knowing what we know now, is this flurry of investigation, was it inevitable regardless of what the president did or didn't do at the time because he certainly can't closed everything down now? GENOVESE: Had he done next to nothing, he would have closed it down. If he has things to hide, then you need to do the cover up, because it could be very damaging. If you follow the money, this could be devastating, it would be explosive for the president, if he's in hock to Russian oligarchs after he's been denying that they dealt with Russia at all, if he owes X amount of money when he's been saying what a great businessman he is. All kinds of things could undermine him, either in terms of his reputation or his legal status.

This is what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, UNITED STATES: The things with people like Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, literally have nothing to do with the President. That doesn't have anything to do with the President or the First Lady. None of these things have anything to do with the President. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: That's actually a mash-up of her saying previously, but she did say it again on Wednesday. One example, she said the case of Roger Stone. You know, Stone is charged about lying about his contacts with the Trump campaign, which is directly related to the President. You know, it was Trump's campaign. Manafort has a bit of giving polling day to (INAUDIBLE) believed he -- you know -- connected to Putin and Russian intelligence, again, directly linked to Donald Trump.

The same is true nationwide.

And therefore, press the button on an invasion. I suppose there is an ambiguity about which way Russia, Vladimir Putin is going to go at the end of these negotiations, with these rounds that come to an end, of course, by the end of this week. KINKADE: Yes, certainly not clear which way they will go, as you pointed out so well, Matthew. Sam, to you. Because not only are there 100,000 troops on the border, the Russian military has been using live drills during the past 24 hours and Ukraine is not involved in these talks. What is their view right now, as they sit on the sidelines of these talks? SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they would be reassured by the constant reassurance coming from NATO officials -- and we heard from Wendy Sherman, the lead U.S. official at these talks and at the bilateral talks, no talks about Ukraine without Ukraine's presence. So the talks with Russia and NATO, much more as Matthew is pointing ,out on the wider scope of relationships with Eastern Europe and so on. But here in Ukraine, there is a very deep sense that they could be on the verge of being invaded. They have at least 120,000 troops reportedly massing on their borders in a kind of pincer shape around the eastern lozenge of the country. There are Russian troops inside the Donbas region of Ukraine, albeit covertly. And they've got into Ukraine intelligence. KILEY: They've seen evidence of two rebel units in the Donbas union, simultaneously with this live exercise being conducted across the border in Russian territory, a clear indication both sides might be working together there, both sides of that border. And meanwhile, of course, you've got these talks on going that are going to involve Ukraine at the OSCE on Thursday and indeed the senior military officers from Ukraine and Georgia, another country neighboring Russia that has troops and occupation of some of its territory, will be there on the ground. So sorry, in Brussels, they'll be present at the NATO talks in Brussels.

(END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: What's your response to those words he added? TOOBIN: It's hard to define un-American, but that statement was un- American. And I say this as people -- as the descendants of, a hundred years ago, people who came to this country looking for opportunity and found it. That's why people have come here. You know, they don't want to be public charges, but they come here and they work hard. And a lot of them work in terrible jobs for low pay and sometimes, they need food stamps to eat -- you know, to feed their families. That's who -- that's who is going to be penalized, the -- not the people who hire the illegal immigrants, who are -- you know, they always get away under the Trump administration. But the people who are working hard and trying to support their families, they're the ones who are punished by this. And it is just a disgrace that that is the prevailing ethos of our administration.

The plunge divers like pelicans will be impacted by the surface oil. They are going to be covered with oil and birds covered with oil, they can't regulate their body temperatures. WHITFIELD: Why are we not seeing a great volume right now? What's your view as to why we are not seeing these pelicans in great volumes? There have been some reports of one that's been found dead covered in oil. There are others scrubbed, but why is it in great volume, a month after this spill we are not seeing more of this like we did after the Exxon Valdez? BOSSART: Well, quite simply, it is because the oil is below the surface. These are -- these animals are impacted when they go to the surface oil because of the way the oil has been mitigated through dispersants and booms. The surface animals are not impacted as much as in past oil spills. WHITFIELD:, You talk about the oil that has submerged, the oil that is at the bottom, at the base of the Gulf 5,000 feet below. Dispersants have been used to try to break up the oil. And then you find some clumps of oil that descend to the bottom. How does that interrupt the marine life? BOSSART: Well, it impacts the marine ecosystem from really the bottom of the food chain all the way up. It impacts the plankton, these whale sharks behind me, all the way up to the fishes and the things the great whales eat. You are having a profound effect on the entire ecosystem. WHITFIELD: Dr. Greg Bossart, thank you for your time and expertise. (END VIDEOTAPE) WHITFIELD: Back to the tragedy in India. This morning, more than 150 people died when an Air India jet liner overshot the runway, crashed and burst into flames. Only a handful of people made it out alive. CNN's Liz Neisloss is near the crash site and is joining us now on the phone. LIZ NEISLOSS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, I'm here in Mangalore, India, outside a hospital where some bodies are being brought and eight survivors. The two here are in fairly stable condition, I'm told. One has an amazing story. It was a medical student sitting at the front of the plane. When the plane broke open, she ran out and somehow dropped down, further down the ravine, where the plane landed and ended up in a tree. That's where she says she was rescued. She has two broken bones. The other survivor here has minor burns and cuts. He was also sitting near the front of the plane. He told his doctor that when the plane crashed and broke open, he jumped out pushing out another passenger ahead of him. He burned his hands trying to unbuckle his seat belt, but ran out to find rescuers. There was one other miraculous tale. Witnesses said",0.1377605391471045,2010-05-22

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK GROOMBRIDGE, FORMER SENIOR POLICY ADVISER TO JOHN BOLTON: He flat out and bluntly said, quote, ""I actually have a lot to say on the subject."" That, by definition, implies that he has information privy to the Ukrainian investigation, and the impeachment process more broadly. He basically implied, I want to discuss what I have to say, but I can't do it at this point. That obviously begs the question of, if not now, then when? We are at a crucial -- you know, a crucial point in American history, you would think that Ambassador Bolton would want the Senate to have all of the information so that he -- so that they can make a fully informed and productive decision. (END VIDEO CLIP) NOBLES: So, it seems like John Bolton is somebody that knows an awful lot about perhaps the missing gaps in this conversation about Ukraine. But are you concerned at all, congresswoman, that a fight over allowing him to testify could drag this process out even more. So, let's say they come to some sort of a negotiated settlement where they say, yes, we can bring these witnesses in. The Trump administration could then fight this out in court, and that could make this process go even longer. How important is it for John Bolton's testimony to be a part of this process? NORTON: It's not critical, but he himself has said it's important. If it's so important, he ought to say, I want to come forward and speak. He's not going to say that, everybody thinks it's because he's tantalizing the public about a book he's writing. As it turns -- as it turns out, our case was so overwhelming that we really don't need him. But what he has said would make it his patriotic duty to come forward and say this is what I know. He's not going to do that. And I predict that we're not going to delay this matter waiting for him to go to court or waiting to go to court to find out whether he should come. We have so much evidence, it just isn't necessary. It's important, but not necessary, if you can understand that. NOBLES: OK, yes, I do.

Here where it's the worst in two decades, but in some case, take a look at this, high temperature in Minneapolis, this is known as the icebox of the U.S., and we have -27 degrees; the record 1909, -25 degrees; Chicago, -23. This is going to tie the record back in 1994. There are other cities, too, that have only had a handful of days where the temperature was below -17 and today's going to be one of those days. So all-time record. Yes, OK, we call it the polar vortex, very interesting; sounds ominous. But in the North Pole, high pressure really kind of keeps all of that real polar cold air in place. Every once in a while those high-level winds, just like a rubber band, kind of ebbs and flows, can give at times. We see it dipping down now in the U.S. Remember two years ago in Europe, it was deadly cold. I remember that. We lost a lot of lives in that cold. But every once in a while it does spill southward. Take a look at high temperatures expected in some different cities here, in North America and into Europe, Washington, D.C., -7; Moscow, 2 degrees, when their average high is -8. Atlanta will be colder than Anchorage, Alaska. This is Yukon cold, heading into the deep Dixie South of the U.S. Tallahassee, Florida, a low temperature of -4 and Oslo's low will be 3, where they should be -7. So they haven't had that polar vortex. But again, it's only the beginning of January. You can see the cold air all the way down to the south, no big concerns just yet for the citrus crops in the Sunshine State. We're not going to see four long days of the cold. So they can keep temperatures with heaters in some of the orchards above where they need to be critical. This is out of here in a couple of days. By Friday, most of the lower 48 states will be either at or above temperatures. So that's great news, especially for all the -- you know, the mothers and fathers had to stay home because there are so many schools that are closed. There are 32 states that have warnings right now for advisories, for extreme winds and the wind chills.

I think it's been totally overblown and kind of embarrassing. BLITZER: Susan... PAGE: Let's see what they actually do, as opposed to what they say. GOLDBERG: Fair enough. PAGE: I mean, the fact is, the administration bought some of this trouble themselves by not letting Congress in on the plans for military tribunals, for one thing, when they were considering the anti-terrorism legislation. I mean, that's one of the dynamics here, is Congress is saying, you want us to support you, let us in on the takeoff. One result of the criticism the administration got is that they've started to define what they're going to do in a more limited way, which would have been a smart thing to do from the start. ROBERTS: That's a very important point. I agree with you, because no hearings were held on this, it was virtually done in secret. It was just announced one day. The whole point of this process is to have consultation, let legal scholars look at it, have the kind of conversation we're having here. We didn't have any of that in this country. We're having it after the fact. And I think the result is that the administration is pulling back, and now they're saying, wait, this is going to be very restricted, very limited. So I think Pat Leahy, in fact, has done exactly the right thing and has had a beneficial effect because the administration is pulling back from some of this. GOLDBERG: You may be entirely right about the optics or the PR aspect of this, that it looks bad for the administration to do this unilaterally without consulting Congress, and we should always consult Congress, because they're such nice people. But on the substance of it, when you read the criticism that has been thrown out there, you would not think that FDR was far more draconian, or that Truman was more draconian, or let alone Abe Lincoln or George Washington. It's as if the Bush administration is -- you know, all this talk about kangaroo courts and drumhead tribunals and all that. It's all poppycock, it's all embarrassing. And the reality is that we're talking about having this as an option, and the American people see through it, even though the coverage of it and the discussion of it has been so skewed. BLITZER: All right. We're going to leave it right there. But a quick question: Bill Safire, a nominal conservative? GOLDBERG: Bill Safire is a contrarian, and that's how he describes himself.

But he also said that Jerusalem should be a place of peace for all religions. And the real question here is what more if anything can the United States do and is willing to do? And the Secretary of State made clear that engagement and asks for de escalation is really where they're at right now. He said that he was sending immediately a top State Department official to the region to meet with Palestinian and Israeli leaders. So we're expecting to see that. He hopes that that could, you know, at least make some sort of an impact here. But the real question is, can it really what can the United States do? And when I asked him if there's any more, he really just responded by saying that engagement and really pressing for war de escalation is where they're at right now. And that's where they should be right now. So we're waiting to see the results of those efforts. ANDERSON: Kylie, Blinken, has said that he is dispatching top state official - to the region, he hopes that he will help de escalate the situation here. I just wonder is it clears what the Biden Administration's plan moving forward is because it is clear that the president is under heavy pressure to put this issue squarely back in focus. ATWOOD: It's really not to be frank with you. I think, you know, it was interesting that President Biden said yesterday that he thinks that the violence will end sooner rather than later. But we really don't have an explanation for why he could make such an assessment right now. We know Biden Administration officials are engaging on this issue, they have had a tremendous number of engagements with officials from the region. But to make that kind of prediction, we really don't know exactly where that is coming from, other than, quite frankly, a hopeful statement to make at this point. So we'll be watching to see if the Biden Administration really does more here. ANDERSON: Kylie Atwood is in Washington for you. Thank you.

There`s 100 percent federal funding for the first three years and if states after taking 100 percent federal money to expand Medicaid for three years decide, well, we liked it better when we had more uninsured people, they can stop insuring them. HARRIS-PERRY: Yes. ANGOFF: The important thing, though, to keep in mind right now is the three years starts on January 1st, 2014. So, for each day that goes by the state is losing -- the state that doesn`t expand Medicaid is losing money. And then in addition, when a state elects not to cover its own poor people through Medicaid, its people are still paying federal taxes to help other states cover their poor people. So, it`s absolutely by that so many states including states like Texas, which have huge percentages of uninsured people, are refusing to take the federal money to insure their own poor people at no cost to themselves. HARRIS-PERRY: Raul, this just feels to me like campaign commercial 101, that if I`m running in 2014 in any state, if I`m a Democrat running in any state where the governor did not expand Medicaid, this is my campaign commercial. REYES: Right. Especially as, you know, time goes by, I think people in different states are going to become more aware of this disparities among the states and thinking like why is it that someone in the state right next door can get the coverage that we can`t, that they have more access, and in states like Florida and Texas with large numbers of African-American voters, Latino voters, and also poor white voters, I think that could be a real wedge issue and we could see a tipping point as we get closer to the midterm, where is people as you said are basically waking up and saying, why do we not have what other states have? We want it and we need it. VANDEN HEUVEL: In addition to the Moral Monday coalition, which is spreading in the south, which is very exciting, it seems to me, picking up on what Ralph Nader said, like a run-ons. A businessman in California who understands how insane it is that you`re not paying workers minimum wage, therefore they`re going on public assistance and costing the taxpayers, that`s a conservative argument. I`d like to see an enlightened business community in these states, which are essentially rejectionist states. There is a map which shows some of the states that are rejectionist at other times in our history are sinking with these, but they should wake up and say you`re leaving money on the table. You`re leaving money on the table. Who is going to take care of the citizens of our country?

We want to take a look at some solutions for you now. We all know that education, of course, is a key to preventing things like child labor. But as we heard in that report, even incidental costs can be a barrier. What if education at a young age became cheaper and easily accessible? What of the world could donate cheap laptops to encourage learning? To that end, India's government is planning to make a $35 computer tablet available to university students next year. You can see it here. It's also considering renting out computers to spread technology awareness. Before India's initiative, you might have heard of the broader One Laptop project, launched by a US professor. The mission there, to provide rugged, inexpensive laptops to the poorest kids in the world. Well, it's been a couple years since One Laptop got started, and we're looking for some good news this evening. So Matt Keller joins us. He's the vice president of Global Advocacy for One Laptop Per Child Foundation, joining us now from Boston. We spoke to you at the launch of this project. How's it going now? MATT KELLER, ONE LAPTOP PER CHILD: It's going well. It's -- we have roughly two million laptops in the hands of children in about 35 to 40 countries worldwide, in 25 to 30 languages. And what we found in the two and a half years that we've actually been in mass production is that children use these laptops in a way that is so sophisticated, and so beyond what we had anticipated, that what is happening is real learning. It's real cognitive development, in a way that -- for example, you and I never had the chance to do in school or to appreciate and to learn. ANDERSON: Sure. Matt, I know that they were a hundred bucks to begin with . How much do they cost now, and how do you get them to these kids all over the world? KELLER: They're about US $180 to $190, depending on costs of raw materials. They're a little more expensive than we'd anticipated. There's more memory than we had originally thought, and some other features to the laptop. That price will come down as the engineering continues to get better. And as we go into the production of a tablet. So, we get them to countries working with governments. Working with the government of Peru, or Rwanda, or Mongolia, or Uruguay. We help train and do some basic education stuff, but the governments at the end of the day own the project, and they get it to the kids' schools, and the kids take it home.

The European Space Agency says they've seen what could be an oil slick near where the plane likely went down in the Mediterranean. Greek officials describe a grim discovery: human remains and parts of an airplane seat. The Egyptian military says their search teams found those and other debris about 300 kilometers north of the coastal city of Alexandria. At least two U.S. officials are among those who suspect the plane was brought down by a bomb. For more on that, let's go to CNN terrorism analyst, Paul Cruickshank. He joins us now from Brussels. Hi, there, Paul. What, in your assessment of the evidence in front of us -- it's still difficult to confirm terrorism, people say keep an open mind. But what do you make of the evidence in front of you? PAUL CRUICKSHANK, CNN TERROR ANALYST: Robyn, there just simply isn't any solid evidence at this point pointing towards terrorism. There's been some speculation from some Egyptian officials, from some U.S. officials. But the kind of solid evidence that really would prove it's terrorism we've just not yet heard about yet. That would include examination of the wreckage, looking at signs that there's been some kind of explosion, analyzing satellite data for some kind of explosion. So far, at least according to Reuters, they have not detected from satellite surveillance any kind of midair explosion. And there's another puzzling aspect of this, Robyn, which is that no terrorism group has claimed responsibility for this incident. And we're almost up to about 40 hours now after this plane went down. ISIS has been very trigger happy in the past about claiming responsibility for terrorist attacks, notably back in October of last year; it took just five hours for it to put out a claim of responsibility when that Russian airliner went down over the Sinai Peninsula, was bombed out -- CURNOW: Ah, dear. We seem to have lost Paul Cruickshank there. We will continue to try and get him back on the show.

And there are also these mistakes that both parties have made and I don't see anybody really owning up to their mistakes. Now early on, maybe, Austan, this is a point for you but early on, you know, I don't think anybody really knew how deep the economic crisis was. And that's not a knock on the administration, because I don't think Republicans knew how deep the economic crisis was, too. Some of the -- high marks for the administration the early months of the crisis. But then after that, it's almost as if the messaging and the ability to get a targeted jobs plan through just evaporated. And now we are spending all this time looking backward.

Let's go to our justice correspondent, Kelli Arena. She's joining us now. Kelli, whoever becomes the next attorney general is going to inherit a department that's got a lot of problems right now. KELLI ARENA, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf. Gonzales's former number two, Paul McNulty has resigned. His replacement, Craig Morford, just started and hasn't been confirmed yet. The number three person at justice is leaving. The head of the civil rights division just announced his departure last week. That's not to mention, Wolf, a bunch of mid-level people left.

And when we come back, the stories of some of the lives lost in flight 17, including three young children and their loving grandfather from Australia who are on their way home and all died together. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: On other reporting on how flight 17 was brought down, we do want to take extra care to remember, this is not just a story about that, it's not even primarily a story about that or the geopolitics of all these or the diplomatic efforts or the military efforts. At the end of the day, this is a story, a story cut short but now preserved in memory of 298 lives. Nick Norris lived, he was traveling home with this three grandchildren, three of 80 kids onboard that flight. He was bringing them home from new school year. His nephew Matthew Jones tonight. Matt, I'm so sorry for what you and your family is going to through. Your uncle Nick was with his three grandchildren, what was Nick like? MATTHEW JONES: Hi Anderson. Look, Nick was a real inspirational hero to me, he was a really strong family man, he was really -- he was a (inaudible) also, a very pragmatic guy and I think it's a real tragedy, the whole thing, for all the families concerned. But also for Nick, you know, there's no way to make this a better story but the fact that he was with his grandchildren right to the end, caring for his family is perhaps a way of looking at the strength that he brought for things. COOPER: That they were all together. How is your mother and your other family members, how are they holding up? JONES: I think understandably, you could say that -- and imagine that they are quite devastated. Not only the lost a cousin or a brother but importantly they've lost three beautiful -- these three beautiful children have been lost as well. And I think that's the real hard of this tragedy, it's such a stealing of innocent life. COOPER: Nick sounds like a incredibly strong guy. What did he do for a living? JONES: Well Nick was really a great thinker, he successfully run a consultancy company, looking at clarity and systemic change, he works around in West Australia but also internationally, helping to bring change about to communities.

It's a series of three shots, so you have to follow through. KING: Do you know of any danger, Dr. Ulene? ULENE: Well, like everything else, there's a side effect to everything. There is no medical treatment known to man that does not have some risk and some side effects. There's a cost associated with immunizing every single child in the country or every adult. And at some point in time, when you have limited resources, you have to say, ""Is this the best way to spend our money?"" And I think that's why there's an argument. KING: And Dr. Healy, do you have a thought on the immunization for hepatitis b? HEALY: Well, I mean, I think the recommendations really now are for people who are exposed, like health care workers, and for people who are sexually active.

CALLER: I've had persistent stomach problems for 2 1/2 years, and after many tests I was diagnosed with Candida. Do you have any advice for me? WEIL: Well, I would be careful of that diagnosis and treatments recommended for it, because most people have this organism -- it's a yeast -- in their intestinal tracts, but it may not be the cause of the symptoms that you're having. And there are some doctors out there and alternative physicians who diagnose lots of people with Candida infections and give expensive treatments for it that may not be the cause of your problems.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Sad news for the literary world today. The renowned children's author and illustrator Maurice Sendak is dead. He's best known for his timeless classic ""Where The Wild Things Are,"" released in 1963. It's a true childhood classic that has touched the lives of generations of readers around the world. He won the Caldecott medal in 1964 for the book's unforgettable illustrations. One critic even called him and I'm quoting now, ""The Picasso of children's literature."" In 2009, the book was made into a feature film directed by Spike Jonze and Sendak's price book is still making its mark on children today. President Obama read ""Where The Wild Things Are"" to a crowd of thousands of this year's White House Easter Egg Roll participants. Sendak illustrated nearly 100 books during his 60-year career and also designed sets and costumes for operas and ballets. His last work entitled ""My Brother's Book"" will be published in February of next year. His publisher said Sendak died today in Danbury, Connecticut of complications following a recent stroke.

The other three we will\nyou throughout this news hour. First, continuing on the crime blotter: Paul Hill has now become the first individual, in this\ncountry, to be put to death for having killed an abortion provider. The former minister executed at 6:08 prevailing local\ntime in Stark, Florida, for the 1994 murders of an abortion doctor and his security guard. The Bradford County sheriff beefed\nup patrols around the prison by adding extra deputies and guard dogs to prevent any protests from going out of control.

(END VIDEO CLIP) KING: Can the president sell that message? Let's sort it out. Joining me tonight, our senior political analyst, Gloria Borger and our National Political correspondent Jessica Yellin. That is a familiar reframe from this president. I guess the question is in an election a little over a hundred days from now can he sell that? GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, he hopes he can. I mean, remember, I inherited the mess and now he is hoping that people are going to remember that but he also, you know, this president is going to be judged on the way he handled the economy. It's the defining issue, not of only the last couple years but also of this decade and he knows it. There are going to be lots of folks out there saying, why did you have to do health care? Why do you have to do immigration? Why didn't you just, and you'll remember this phrase, focus like a laser on the economy? JESSICA YELLIN, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: I was at a briefing at the Treasury Department today. It was on housing policy, but they kept making the very same point. That remember where we were at the end of 2008. Remember how bad things were when we got into office. It's changed so much, can't you remember that? It was almost a plea. I think that that is a fair point to make. I'm not convinced that voters will remember it. KING: Not as horrible, vote me, is a tough message to sell. BORGER: Yes, it's completely valid, but again, as we were discussing last night, you've got to look at those unemployment numbers. That's what people are feeling right now. And even though they've passed financial reform today and people want Wall Street regulated, they're still thinking, why did we bail out? KING: All right. Let's move on because as the president tries to make his case about this year, there are a number of people who would like to be on the ballot in 2012 out raising some money. Mitt Romney way ahead in fund raising among the potential 2012 Republican presidential candidates. Here are the latest numbers covering April, May, and June. Romney raised more than twice as much money as Sarah Palin or the Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty also has double the cash on hand. But all three out raised Mike Huckabee. Tell us anything?

And, you know, keep in mind that the magnitude and just the amass of evidence that has now been left behind by the carnage, the forensic evidence, just trying to consider how many eyewitnesses have to be interviewed is undaunting. And every time it that leads to another dot in the equation to connect all the dots, this is going to be an investigation that's going to take many, many days if not weeks if not months to finally put together the complete puzzle. Because keep in mind this is one of the unique scenarios where we have someone in custody that is going to face judicial process and going to be prosecuted. We can't forget that the evidence that's going to have to be put forward to secure a conviction in this case. I know that sounds ridiculous but keep in mind he's going to be afforded all of the due process rights and that's going to be in a court of law. So the FBI, local and the state law enforcement wants to ensure that they get as much evidence as possible to ensure a conviction or may ultimately a plea of guilty, so this person is going to go to jail for rest of his life. LEMON: Yeah and that's the American system, due process. Art, I want to ask you a very same question as we look at this live pictures from the airport there because they are still because they are still -- they are continuing to investigate the airport, they still close. What are the investigators looking at now? ART RODERICK, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: You know, I think we've talked about everything. They're peeling back this individual's life and getting under his skin and trying to figure out exactly what the motivation was, was there anybody out there to help him. But Stuart is correct. Usually we don't have a live perpetrator there, so they're going to have to take their time because they're going to put the evidence together for presentation in court. Which takes a lot of time and you have to make sure you dot the Is across the Ts and get the correct search warrants, make sure everybody is got the right thread to him. So, there's a lot that goes in, it's going to go into this particular investigation, because eventually we're going to see this individual come to trial. I think at another key point, Don, is on the after action side, when I first saw this occurring, I was wondering why they didn't shut down the whole airport. Now, I know that this incident occurred at one particular terminal but, you know, we heard the witness talk about, you know he was getting texts about what was going on and there's text turned out to be incorrect.

The woman has filed a lawsuit against the sheriff's office. The video was released the same day. The officer seen dumping the quadriplegic man out of his wheelchair has resigned. The sheriff's office says it is an internal investigation which is still ongoing.

People were marching in \'65 to have the right to vote. They\nwere trying to suppress their vote by doing poll taxes, by threatening people, by not giving them the ability to vote. Here\nwe are, 47 years later and workers are getting the same thing. They try to take away same day voter registration. They try\nto cut down or eliminate the number of early voting so that people can go to the polls, it makes it easier for them. They\ntry to impose these voter I.D. laws and they say there\'s voter fraud but they can produce no voter fraud. It\'s an attempt\nto suppress the votes.\n \n\n So, 47 years after the original Selma march, here we are, marching again, because the same assault on workers\' rights,\nvoters\' rights and immigrant rights, quite frankly, are taking place in this country.

But what are progressives going to say when the president says I propose a spending freeze, and I'm told the draft is being circulated today, somewhere in the ballpark of a three or four year a freeze on federal spending. Republicans will say that doesn't go enough, but I suspect liberals are going to say wait a minute, Mr. President, what are you doing freezing spending? I'm also told he will not say let's cut Social Security and Medicare, but he will say it is time for Republicans and Democrats to sit down together and deal with Social Security and Medicare and those big entitlement programs because without changes there, you can't do serious deficit reduction.

I think you're going to see a number of Democrats that do want to see us grapple with spending. In terms of what some members of our caucus will say, I think that they want to see jobs in this country. They want to see people employed again. And the only way we're going to get there is if we, at is the same time as we are doing those necessary spending caps, that we also look at tax reform. So what I'm hoping to hear from the president is some significant tax reform, simplification of our system. Some of the ideas that were put out there by the Deficit Commission Report, like maybe limiting the home mortgage deduction, which is really important to middle class people. But limiting to it $500,000 in value on a home. That covers an awful lot of people",0.2343431314566187,2011-01-24

Tracking Tropical Storm Isaac, it's barreling towards Haiti and then right to the U.S., possibly impacting next week's Republican convention. Chad Myers with the latest, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEMON: T.S. Isaac, Tropical Storm Isaac, barreling across the Caribbean right now. It is stirring up major concern from Haiti all the way to Florida, where the Republican National Convention set to begin on Monday. But just a short time ago, Florida Governor Rick Scott assured folks in his state they are prepared for Isaac. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA: Florida has a lot of experience dealing with hurricanes. We're going to be prepared for Isaac in the event it does impact our state and in the event it does become a hurricane. Isaac's a unique storm in this regard. It has the potential to threaten a major convention, designated a ""special national security event."" That's why I have convened local, state, federal, and convention officials for a twice-daily briefing. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: Straight away now to meteorologist Chad Myers. He is tracking this storm for us. What do you know? CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: I know that it hasn't organized much today, yet. That's something good. We don't want it to get organized because then it gets stronger. There it is, right there, but it's filling up the Caribbean. From -- literally from the Dominican Republic all the way down to Venezuela, there are clouds. There are going to be more clouds, too. Here's the forecast guidance. Talk about the models, every once in a while. They have shifted to the left, which means most of them are even missing Florida out here in the Gulf of Mexico, maybe clipping the Keys, we'll see. But nothing to the east, not much too far to the west, but that tells me at 5:00, the Weather Service may, in fact, throw this thing a little bit farther away from Tampa into the Gulf of Mexico. Great news for Florida, the peninsula. Bad news maybe for the Florida Panhandle. This could be a much bigger storm if it stays offshore in that very warm water off the Gulf. LEMON: Can you imagine, if we have a convention and a hurricane, the news and weather people's heads would pop off. MYERS: They'd all be fighting for airtime. No. No, me. No, me. LEMON: I want to see Wolf, Gloria, and Candy in red jackets, blowing around. MYERS: There, you go. LEMON: Nobody gets hurt, though, in that scenario. All right, let's talk the economy.

1772491,2088327,CNN,The Situation Room,"of Florida says he's demanding answers. What questions do you have? ANITERE FLORES (R), FLORIDA STATE SENATOR: Well, first and foremost, I would say it's absolutely unacceptable that any person in the care of others to die in this way. It's something that's absolutely horrible. What we have heard very initially that this is a nursing home that had some challenges already in the past. They had had some violations. The laws in the state of Florida are very clear that the nursing home has to have an evacuation plan, a plan in action to ensure individuals that they are servicing have livable conditions. And that includes water, food, and in South Florida, it really does mean air conditioning. So for us to have gone to this point is something that is unacceptable. I know there is a criminal investigation that's happening right away. But as soon as we need legislation to further enforce the laws, to make sure that this doesn't happen again, we will definitely be doing that. BLITZER: Do you worry, Anitere, that senior citizens across the state are also vulnerable right now? This nursing home, as you know, right across the street from Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, one of the major hospitals in South Florida. FLORES: Well, look, honestly, the nursing home administrators should have used that close area to be able to then take vulnerable elderly to the hospital. What we do know is that power is being restored at a record pace and, in most cases, homes where there are elderly, nursing homes, assisted living facilities are being restored and they have a priority. Why this happened is something that we will find out after a full investigation is happening. I do know that other nursing homes up and down particularly the east coast of Florida have taken this news in Florida to heart and are starting to evacuate some of their own residents to nearby hospitals, to make sure this doesn't happen somewhere else. BLITZER: We're showing our viewers, Anitere, some aerials of U.S. National Guard troops in Lauderhill, Florida, preparing water for delivery. It's not just power. It's clean water, it's cell phone service, still tremendous shortages throughout the state. You must be so frustrated. FLORES: I think that the biggest frustration, you know, as was mentioned previously, for residents of the Florida Keys that are trying to get back into the lower Keys. My legislative district includes the entire Monroe County, that beautiful 100-mile stretch where so many people go to vacation to. And to see some of the pictures out of there are very troubling, very disheartening. But here's some of the good news. The good news is that in only three days since this storm has hit, the roads are clear. The roads are able to withstand the ability of people to come over the bridges. The challenges that exist in the Lower Keys is really that of running water. I know that the Florida Keys Aqueduct Authority",0.2789324515824279,2017-09-13

We are embracing standards. But this over testing is just crowding out the chance for teachers to actually teach these students what they need to know. KORNACKI: OK. We`ve got to squeeze a break in here. But I want to talk a little bit more about trying to figure out the opposition to this and what it means for where Common Core is going if it has a future at all. We`ll pick it up right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KORNACKI: I want to look at the politics of the Common Core because, again, what`s really struck me about this issue, what landed it on my radar was there was a -- one of those presidential cattle calls in New Hampshire a couple of weeks ago. The Republican prospects for 2016 came up. And I tuned in because I have no life on weekends and I watch these things. But I expected I would hear the usual Obamacare bashing. That would be the main thing. And what I heard more than anything else was Common Core. And I said this is -- this is -- this seems to be replacing Obamacare as the big rallying cry on the right. And, Lyndsey, I want to -- I want to ask you a little bit about that because there is a poll taken last -- just last July, July of 2013, asking people about Common Core. Will it improve or will it -- you know, will it hurt educational outcomes, education quality. Among Republicans, 44 percent said improve, 13 -- it was not controversial among Republicans then. But I`m noticing just in the last -- I`m guessing three to six months there has just been a major change at the grassroots level in the Republican Party that has forced all of these big named Republicans not just to change their position but now to be trumpeting this. And I watched Jeb Bush go to an event in Florida last month and he was heckled, he was heckled on his way into the event because of his support for Common Core. What specifically on the right is driving this? Is this just another way of attacking President Obama or is there something -- is there something else to it? LAYTON: Well, Steve, basically if you think back to 2012, you know, Obama is re-elected. The Common Core is being rolled out into classrooms. And the Tea Party is extremely frustrated. It really -- it`s scorched on its efforts to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Right? That`s rolling ahead. And it`s feeling really frustrated and it looks around and it sees the Common Core as a vehicle to ignite its supporters. And basically to revive itself. And so last summer, groups like Freedom Works and others that are associated with -- or funded by the Koch brothers start",0.06414247283653,2014-04-27

There's only so much you can do though in discussions in New York. There are concerns with a neighboring Pakistan about what could unfold at its border with Afghanistan. The UN says Pakistan has already taken in more than 1 million Afghan refugees. And reports on Turkish state media say Turkey's President is offering to work with Islamabad to try to stabilize Afghanistan, what would that look like? We have live reports from both Turkey and Pakistan. Arwa Damon is in Istanbul, Sophia Saifi is standing by in Islamabad. Sophia, I want to start with you. It's the neighboring country. What's the situation now? Are we starting to see waves of internally displaced people massing at the border? What can you tell us about the latest on that? SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER: Hala, nothing of that just yet. I mean, Pakistan has spent the past couple of years completely fencing off its border with Afghanistan. So as of late July, the army had announced that they've fenced off about 90 percent of the border with Afghanistan just to make sure that what they call are you know, miscreants or terrorists hanging out on the other side of the border don't come through. Now what's happened is, is that there are two main border crossings with Pakistan and Afghanistan. There's the German border crossing in Afghanistan - in Balochistan in the south. And there is a Torkham border crossing in the north in the KPK Province of Pakistan. The German border crossing is slowly allowing in a trickle of pedestrians who do have visas. However, the Torkham border has still not allowed any pedestrian movement to come into Pakistan, they're only allowing trucks that were actually momentarily closed early morning yesterday. Pakistan also said in early July, that it just does not have the capacity to house any more refugees. And that's a line that they reiterated again and again till you know last week I spoke to Moeed Yusuf who is the National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister. And he reiterated that there is no way that Pakistan however generous it has been in the past can take in more refugees until there's an international plan to do so. GORANI: And Arwa Damon in Istanbul what is Turkey thing? ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, look Hala, Turkey at this stage doesn't have much sway with the Taliban when it comes to what Turkey can actually do in terms of stabilization or exerting pressure on the Taliban. What Turkey does have is a very close relationship with two countries who could potentially put pressure on the Taliban and that is Pakistan, and --. Turkey's main aim right now as is the main aim of all of Afghanistan's neighboring countries is to prevent this influx of refugees, because like Pakistan, Turkey, also is saying",0.5485103132161955,2021-08-16
130686,211671,CNN,CNN Sunday,"FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Turning now to Oklahoma, it was one week ago today that a barge struck a bridge over the Arkansas River, sending vehicles plunging into the water. In commemoration of the 14 people who were killed, a memorial site will open at a park today overlooking the bridge. The accident was not the first of its kind. CNN's Brian Cabell takes a look at the freight industry and the dangers associated with hit. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN CABELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Consider the navigable waterways in the U.S., a 25,000-mile interstate highway system, a wet one of course. The 6,000 tugs and 30,000 barges are the huge tractor trailers that move cargo north and south, east and west. Captain Sean Caillquet is part of the flow around New Orleans. How busy can the traffic get here? SEAN CAILLQUET, RIVERBOAT CAPTAIN: It can get so busy to where the light that's controlling this point right here will make people wait. CABELL: Stop lights, crowded intersections, parked vehicles on the side of the river, and occasionally accidents, the devastating crash in Oklahoma on Sunday, the even more deadly one in 1993 near Mobile, Alabama when the pilot became lost in bad weather. His barge hit a bridge. A train tumbled off that bridge, killing 47 people. The problem as Sean Calliquet shows us is tugs and barges can't stop quickly, especially in fast currents. CALLIQUET: I'm going to stop and back. CABELL: He cuts back on the throttle. Now you're trying to stop. It takes a full 30 seconds to stop the tug. Piloting this boat is radically different from driving a truck. Getting a license is more difficult. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Far more difficult, you're looking at a couple of years of experience as well as testing in six different fields. CABELL: Conrad Williams used to pilot a tug, but moved back to land. He's not a locks operator. He oversees 50 or 60 barges passing through his locks daily. Down below, 3,000 tons of benzene on one barge. CONRAD WILLIAMS, LOCKS OPERATOR: It would take maybe about 10 rail cars or 12 rail cars to carry the same thing and maybe more or maybe 50 trucks to carry the same amount of cargo. So - CABELL: It's cheaper. WILLIAMS: So, it's cheaper. CABELL: Cheap and relatively safe, he says, in spite of the occasional headline making accidents. One of America's oldest modes of transportation remains one of its most reliable. Brian Cabell, CNN, New Orleans.

LGBT women, they just put gender-neutral language in the bill. Yes, it is as this is asexual people who are being victimized and of course, native American women, you know, had to go to federal court so they would be hundreds of miles away from support, and basically not helping them at all. HARRIS-PERRY: Absolutely. So, thank you, you have laid out a lot of that. You want to say just quickly that we did extend an invitation to the Republican congresswoman Sandy Adams who is the coauthor of the Republican bill. She is also a survivor of domestic violence herself. She was unable to join us due to a scheduling conflict, but I want to, you know, Congresswoman Moore, just laid out sort of what the fundamental questions in these versions of the bill are -- yes, there is this language of neutrality, but does neutrality actually end up leaving out or letting folks fall through the cracks? VITORIA DEFRANCESCO SOTTO, NBC LATINO CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. You know, and I think the one provision about immigrants, we have to separate it out into a couple of different sections so it hurts authorized immigrants so the women who have married a U.S. citizen, and they are waiting for their permanent residency, during the case their immigration paperwork is halted and there used to be a provision for self-petitioning, meaning if I`m abused I can go and seek out recourse and get that process starting without my abuser. Now, they bring the abuser back into it, and then we get in to the unauthorized immigrants. So, the unauthorized immigrants have recourse starting 2000 with the u-visa. HARRIS-PERRY: Yes. SOTTO: f I`m a farm worker and my foreman is sexually abusing me, I can go and get this visa, but now they are saying, it is a lot more difficult to get, and if you get that u-visa, you are not eligible for permanent residence. HARRIS-PERRY: Right. And we are talking about months and months of waiting. And that even before that is possible. HUEVEL: I mean, to me, there is a cruelty here underlying so much of this on two levels. One, a cruelty and cluelessness. A cluelessness it seems to me in week when census statement comes out showing that will soon be a majority, minority country; yet, the house puts forward this bill which excludes provisions for protection of native Americans, for immigrants, for LGBT same-sex couples, then the cruelty.

2031458,2348281,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"He's basically saying that she needs to seem tough but still get her way and being reluctant on impeachment. Do you agree with that? JOSH DAWSEY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you have a rising crescendo of claims, Brooke, from Democrats who want the President to be impeached and you have Nancy Pelosi who's in a tough spot. Even her allies would say that, where she doesn't want to impeach him but yet she wants to continue to say, he did things that she believes should lead to impeachment and is essentially making the argument just for political reasons, we can't. And it's unclear how that works from a long-term sustainable perspective. See, if Nancy Pelosi who is really trying to keep some for more liberal members in check by all accounts, while also, talking tough on the President. But she's made it clear, even when she said she wants to see him in prison. She doesn't want to see him impeach over, and over, and over. And there's a chance that President Trump wins in 2020 -- wins reelection. And then where does that position stand. So, for a lot of her colleagues, it's becoming increasingly frustrating, it seems with how exactly she's handling this. BALDWIN: So we just went through, you know, what had happened a couple weeks ago, right? When she said what she did about being a cover-up, flash-forward to the Rose Garden news conference. DAWSEY: Right. BALDWIN: You know, sent the man into a tizzy for 24 hours. But in saying that he should be in prison, you know -- cover-up prison, like, how do you think he is going to respond to that? DAWSEY: Well, you saw her comments on the cover-up. It certainly sparked a pretty frustrated reaction from the President. He saw those on television that morning and have that unusual press conference and made lots of chatter by the next day at another press conference, basically, to refute what Nancy Pelosi said. He's overseas this week, so it's unclear exactly how much he's paying attention to the minutia back in Washington. But he has always has his eye back on domestic politics -- Brooke. So you can imagine that it will certainly provoke a reaction. We saw over in Europe, the President after 1:00 a.m. London time, and attacked Chuck Schumer for some of his comments earlier this week.

52052,56651,CNN,Worldview,"BERNARD SHAW, CNN ANCHOR: Seven years ago, Israelis and Palestinians agreed to take concrete steps for peace. Today, they accuse each other of violating the letter and the spirit of their agreements. Here's CNN State Department correspondent Andrea Koppel. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDREA KOPPEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It began with this historic handshake: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, for so long bitter enemies, now suddenly partners for peace. In September, 1993, they signed the Oslo Accord, named for the city in Norway where Israeli and Palestinian officials had carried out months of secret negotiations. Uri Savir led the Israeli team. URI SAVIR, CHIEF ISRAELI OSLO NEGOTIATOR: Why did I want to be part of a team in Oslo that wanted to put an end of the occupation? Obviously, for the Palestinians to have a better life, but mainly for us. It rescued us. KOPPEL: And it also earned Rabin and Arafat a Nobel Peace Prize. Under Oslo, the Israelis and Palestinians agreed to a series of land- for-peace compromises to be implemented over the next five years, that is: In exchange for recognizing Israel's right to exist, renouncing its intentions to destroy Israel, and condemning all acts of terrorism against the Israeli people, the Palestinians would gradually get control over much of the West Bank and Gaza, including the right to form their own police force and other institutions like banks, schools, health care facilities, and a seaport and an airport -- in essence, all the necessary ingredients to build a Palestinian state. The hope: During this period, the two sides would build up enough trust to eventually tackle the most sensitive, final-status issues, including the future of Jerusalem. DAVID MAKOVSKY, AUTHOR: Its promise rested in its incrementalism: that the parties realized that there were so many obstacles that had to be overcome that they couldn't do it all in one leap. KOPPEL: But critics say that go-slow approach was also its peril, leaving Palestinian and Israeli leaders open to accusations that implementation was either going too quickly or not quickly enough. ROBERT PELLETREAU, FMR. U.S. ASST. SECY. OF STATE: A big failure of Oslo, if you will, is that Oslo did not focus particularly on preparing public opinion. It focused more on how negotiating delegations would negotiate. KOPPEL: This cycle of trying to contain one crisis after another through a series of high-level summits has played out over the last seven years from Oslo to Cairo to Wye River, Maryland. Only this summer, at Camp David, did the parties finally begin to tackle the most difficult issues of all. When Camp David ended without an agreement, Palestinian despair eventually led to violence. HASSAN ABDEL RAHMAN, PALESTINIAN REP. TO U.S.: They waited for seven years for the peace process to produce a qualitative change in their lives. It did not.

VELSHI: Maybe he'll wear cashmere hoodies. If he was going to change to impress Wall Street, the time to do it was two weeks ago before he went on all those road trips. At this point, the guy is worth $18 billion. What do we have to change for? Let me give you the update on what I'm getting right now. A number of people have said the trading was supposed to start at 11:05 a.m. Here is what is happening in the background. In the background, there are bids for all sorts of amounts of money, right? Some have what's called a market ordering, meaning I want shares of Facebook. I want $100 shares, no matter what they cost. There are people who hold Facebook stock because they were early- stage investors and they are trying to say I want as much as I can get for my stock. So somebody is probably willing to pay $200 for this stock. Somebody else is willing to pay $35. Somebody else is willing to pay $25. WHITFIELD: So it is the deeper pockets who are able to do that. VELSHI: Yes, that's right, but what the exchanges are trying to do is reconcile this so that you don't see gyrations on the stock as soon as it opens. They are going to say that first price you see when that moves from unchanged, it will be a green arrow and it will be up. And that should be a stock that represents what many, many people are buying it at. And we are looking at the range of 25 million shares to 35 million shares that they have already reconciled at a particular price. What the exchanges are trying to do before the stock opens is reconcile as many shares as possible so that that first trade represents 50 million shares maybe and is a solid price, so you don't have crazy volatility. So the point is, there are already deals. There are bids and there are asks. And as soon as they reconcile this, it is just taking time probably because of the volume of shares and the volume of trade. You will see that move and my indications from traders I'm talking to is that it will be somewhere above $42, probably somewhere around $45, in that range, $42 to $45. And then it will be open for the market. You can get on your e- Trade or Ameritrade or Schwab or Scottrade, whatever you want, and you can start putting in bids and asks and it can go anywhere from there. It can go up or down, but it looks like the first trade will be up and it will probably be up by several dollars. It is hard to just look at a screen that says unchanged.

Well, it looks like after the first two weeks of testimony the prosecutors have finished for now calling family, friends and neighbors of Scott Peterson. They're now laying out the investigation from the very beginning. Four Modesto police officers that were first on the scene the night Laci Peterson disappeared testified on Friday about what Scott Peterson did and didn't do. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DORNIN (voice-over): Jurors found out just how quickly Modesto police became suspicious of Scott Peterson. Sergeant Byron Duerfeldt testified he summoned a detective to investigate within two hours after he arrived the night of Laci Peterson's disappearance. Somewhat unusual, he said, for a missing persons case. The defense said Modesto police zeroed in on Peterson too quickly and did a sloppy job. Prosecutors claim investigators were not only thorough, but left few clues undiscovered. It was a week highlighting alleged discrepancies in Peterson's stories to family and friends. Three people testified Scott Peterson told them he went golfing the day his wife disappeared. His alibi to police, he went fishing. Harvey Kemple, a relative of Laci Peterson, says he became so suspicious because of that remark, he followed Peterson around town twice. Family and friends testified Peterson seemed unemotional to them following his wife's disappearance. But then Susan Medina, a neighbor, told the court that Peterson came to her house one day and broke down and cried. Medina's house was burglarized in the two days that followed Laci Peterson's disappearance. She also testified transients often came through the neighborhood, something the defense is likely to capitalize on later with their theory that Laci Peterson was abducted while walking her dog. Two weeks of testimony and no bombshells, no evidence yet presented by prosecutors that directly links Peterson to the crime. (END VIDEOTAPE) DORNIN: There could be some fireworks in the courtroom this week. The defense has claimed that two of the lead detectives outright lied in the case. So we can expect the cross-examinations there to -- to be rather fiery. Also, one detective, they claim, left his car keys in Scott Peterson's truck and then left his case notebook in the boat, showing how sloppy their investigative techniques were. Still no word on when the star witness for the prosecution, Amber Frey, will testify, of course Scott Peterson's former witness -- mistress will testify. No word yet. We're expecting it any time within the next two months -- Daryn. KAGAN: And that would be about the time the prosecution would wrap up and the defense would get their turn? DORNIN: Well, it looks like things are going a little more quickly than we expected. This was supposed to be a five- or six- month trial. Things seem to be moving along a little bit more quickly.

America's homeland security and counterterrorism systems will continue to erode in the absence of strong, consistent, unwavering presidential stewardship."" She's getting pretty tough with the president, just like her dad. CARVILLE: Yes. You know because I would point out, take the eye off the ball, you know, her dad invaded the wrong country. Talk about taking your eye off the ball. They treated this guy just like they treated -- I don't really think that Liz Cheney or her father really care about the facts. They say Obama doesn't say anything about terrorism and they run seven clips of Obama saying that, or they say the treatment was the same for this guy as it was for Reid, so you go down the line. So I just think -- I don't know if they've ever said we didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or 9/11 -- that Iraq didn't have something to do with 9/11. I think they're just more annoyed by facts than anything else, and I think they really believe this and that's the only reason they keep saying it because everybody keeps pointing out all of the flaws in the things that they say, and it doesn't matter so it's a free country. I guess they can say what they want. BLITZER: We invited Liz Cheney to come on today, but unfortunately she couldn't but we're hoping in the coming days she'll be joining us. She's got a very different perspective than James Carville. Thanks very much. Fredricka Whitfield is monitoring other top stories here in THE SITUATION ROOM right now. Fred, what do you have?

It means she agrees there is enough evidence to convict her of perjury, but she doesn't acknowledge guilt. It all stems from allegations that she did not report gifts from a developer with whom she had a romantic relationship. Last month, she was convicted of misappropriating about $500,000 in gift cards donated to the city for the needy during her time as city council president.

ROMANS: Berman, what are the chances that the budget passed as it is written in the boxes? BERMAN: Minus infinity. SAMBOLIN: OK, let's go to Brianna Keilar. She's standing by live for us. Brianna? BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hi there. You're taking a look at the budget here obviously. The chances that they are passed exactly as you see them there in those, obviously very nil. But this is sort of President Obama's official opening salvo in this discussion that he will be having about deficit reduction with Republicans and, of course, also with members of his own party. But today, this morning, President Obama in the Rose Garden as his budget is officially unveiled and he'll be talking about how deficit reduction is important, but he'll say it's not the only thing that needs to be done. The deficit reduction can't be done at the expense of investing in things like education and job training and infrastructure, which are some new areas of spending we are expected to see in the budget because we have seen the outline in recent days. One of the big talking - one of the big headlines that folks will be talking about today will be what the carrot to Republicans. It is -- you may have heard referred to as chained CPI. Well, what the heck is that, you may say? That is an adjustment to how Social Security benefits are doled out. This is something that Republicans are happy that is in his proposal and many liberals are very upset about, because it would reduce the spending to Social Security recipients, which is obviously a huge driver of the deficit. But it would reduce the spending by decreasing the cost of living adjustments, those increases that seniors see. And this would have a very real impact for a lot of seniors who rely on Social Security for their income; they're on a fixed income and this is where they get their money just to do their household expenses. So if you take a look, we actually have a chart to show the very real effects of this to folks on Social Security and how it would change over time. As seniors get older, as in the up years, age 80 to 85, 90, 95, you can see how this would mean less money to Social Security recipients over time compared to if the numbers were to stay as they are right now. So this is something, as I said, that Republicans are happy about, but there's also things in here, guys, that Republicans unhappy about. And that would be tax increases which they would be loath to agree, about $600 billion in tax increases over ten years mainly by limiting that mortgage interest deduction that so many people take, and they get money back in their tax return for.",0.1305184539061222,2013-04-10

STEVEN D'ANTUONO, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN CHARGE, FBI WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE: We are coming to you again because we know someone out there somewhere will recognize these individuals. They are captured on video committing appalling crimes against officers who have devoted their lives to protecting the American people. SCHNEIDER: The FBI has received more than 200,000 tips. Some have led to key arrests including earlier this week when Julian Khater and George Tanios were arrested and charged with assaulting three officers with chemical spray, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died a day later. The official cause of his death has still not been released. More than 300 people have been arrested for the Capitol attack and so far 65 have been charged with assaulting law enforcement officers. But the FBI says some of these most violent still can't be identified. D'ANTUONO: These individuals are responsible for assaults on law enforcement officers who are protecting the Capitol and our democratic process on January 6th. SCHNEIDER: It is a chilling scene that has played out many times. But now with a spotlight on some of the perpetrators, the FBI is asking the public to help identify. (END VIDEOTAPE) SCHNEIDER (on camera): And in addition to these ten suspects now being sought, the FBI says there are also still 250 unidentified individuals involved in the Capitol attack that they are also seeking.

FAUCI: No, here we go again with the theater. Let's get down to the facts. When you talk about the infection and you don't keep in the concept of variants, that's an entirely different ball game.

1174270,1480335,CNN,Piers Morgan Live,"because apparently the elder brother had been in some sort of training, some sort of contact with an al Qaeda-like group. This is early reporting. It could be very well wrong. And, you know, we're going to get a lot out of this young man's interrogation and we're going to find out if this was sponsored from overseas. I think the interesting thing is the Russians apparently came to Washington and brought the elder brother's name up. The question is what did they tell them and why was this not followed up. A couple days ago I said I didn't think this was an intelligence failure but if, in fact, the Russians did warn us about him, we could be something else here. MORGAN: Let me ask you about that, Juliette Kayyem, because that could be a big question mark once the celebration of this particular operation which has clearly been successful, once that dies down, there will be an inquest into what has gone on in the background to all this, and it has turned out the FBI did indeed interview one of these two brothers two years ago and he is somebody that they now believe was having quite serious Islamic fundamentalist development in his life, will there be raised eyebrows about this? KAYYEM: There probably will. There always are. Let's see where these facts take us. These are early reports. The FBI has confirmed that they did interview him and so we are just going to see. It is at this stage looking back, it's important for two reasons. One is of course intelligence failures, did we have any information, but also on the response, you know, were there lessons learned in terms of what has unfolded the last five days? But those are two important points and that should be natural. We talk about a resilient society. One of the aspects of a resilient society is we learn from mistakes made in the past. But the other aspect of this that I do, I want to make clear, this was not political. There is about to be likely a huge political debate about the use of our U.S. criminal courts for terrorism cases. I stand pretty firm as many people in the counterterrorism field do that our courts have the capacity to take any suspect like this and process them, use evidence against them, convict them and put them into jail. But we are about to embark on something that is unique for the U.S. we have not had a case like this in a long while. But it's just important for people to know that while this has been very unfamiliar the last couple of days, this will be a very familiar court case, lots of attention of course, but using federal terrorism charges which is why they were written against the defendant.

We need to remake the Democratic Party. We need to remake America. We need to take it back on behalf of the people of this country. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: Gore's announcement stunned many political watchers and left the former Gore running mate, Joe Lieberman, and other Democratic contenders, out in the cold. Joining us now to talk about all of this, two guests, CNN ""CROSSFIRE"" hosts, Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala. They're on CNN's Election Express Bus right now in Durham, North -- Durham, New Hampshire, that is. Thanks very much to both of you for joining us. Paul, let me begin with you. Is it my impression or do you agree that Al Gore is increasingly becoming more liberal in this current phase of his political life, moving away from what he was for so many years, a sort of centrist DLC, Democratic Leadership Council, kind of Bill Clinton moderate Democrat? PAUL BEGALA, CO-HOST, ""CROSSFIRE"": I don't really think it's a left-right move, Wolf. I have to say I think it's a -- it's a disloyal move to Joe Lieberman. I am not thrilled to see it. I have nothing against Howard Dean. He has performed remarkably effectively in the campaign. But I don't think this is a left-right move. You know Dean, in many ways, is a moderate. He was part of the DLC for quite some time. He doesn't support federal gun control laws, for example, new federal gun control laws. I don't think that's it. I think -- I take the vice president, at his word. He, like very -- a whole lot of us, a lot of Democrats, did not like the idea of this war, did not want the Congress to vote for that resolution. And there really is one major candidate who, in my eyes, and the eyes of many people in the Democratic Party, was right about that and who agreed with Gore about that, and that was Howard Dean. And it seems to be what led him to this. I do say I wish he had been a little more generous, frankly, to his chosen running mate, Joe Lieberman, who he told us three years ago was the very best person to run the country if Al Gore couldn't do it.

But he was a priest that crossed beyond the pulpit into the real world and had a huge impact on the lives of many in South Africa and around the world, maybe one of the most consequential Africans to have ever lived, almost in the same mold as Nelson Mandela, not quite as towering but close. QUEST: Larry, thank you. I'm joined now by William Gumede. He's the author of ""Thabo Mbeki and the Battle for the Soul of the ANC,"" executive chair person for the Democracy Works Foundation, from Johannesburg. The interesting thing, William Gumede, is that Desmond Tutu, in the end, criticized roundly the ANC, the very government that he helped, in a sense for -- push forward through the destruction of apartheid. WILLIAM GUMEDE, DEMOCRACY WORKS FOUNDATION: Yes, thank you for having me. I think Desmond Tutu was one of South Africa's and Africa's great moral leaders. People tend to forget, even in the 1970s and 1980s, he criticized the apartheid government but also abuses by the ANC and Black leaders. He did that consistently. although he was popular, sometimes the Black leaders were very annoyed with him because he criticized them when they messed up. He did exactly the same after the end of apartheid. On the second day of the first week of the Mandela government, after 1994, he loudly criticized both Nelson Mandela and the ANC for setting the same apartheid state benefits of the apartheid leaders. Because he said, look, the majority of Black South Africans are very poor. And for a new government, (INAUDIBLE) government, also to set the same benefits, it just sent a wrong moral message. And when the corruption happened in the ANC government, he was consistently very critical of the ANC government. QUEST: If we look at the most recent government, Zuma and state capture and the ANC, and all of these things, did he continue to be that moral compass, do you think? GUMEDE: You know, he remained consistent until his deathbed to be as a moral critic and to provide moral leadership. He was very critical, particularly -- he also was critical of former governments and then of former president Jacob Zuma and even the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa. And he actually said very clearly that, you know, Black South Africans, they should not vote for the ANC if the ANC is corrupt, uncaring and they should not vote on the basis of Black solidarity if the Black leaders or Black government is incompetent or corrupt or uncaring. QUEST: Professor, was anybody listening in those later years, do you think? They listened during apartheid. The Black majority followed, listened and worshipped with him. In later years, were people listening? GUMEDE: You know, he was roundly criticized by the ANC when he criticized them for wrongdoing. Even Mandela expressed his annoyance publicly.

First of all, you had a rare vantage point into the process of the bankruptcy settlement with Purdue Pharma. You sat on something called the UCC, the Unsecured Creditor's Committee. So, there are nine seats on this UCC that are supposed to kind of represent all 600,000 claims, four of the nine are victims. Maybe, if you don't mind, telling the audience why are you specifically sitting in the seat of one of the victims? RYAN HAMPTON, AUTHOR, ""UNSETTLED"": Sure. So, I'm someone who is in recovery from a decade-long opioid use disorder, addiction. I was homeless. It, you know, kicked off with me in a doctor's office in 2003. I got caught up in the Florida pill mills pretty badly. I was prescribed oxycontin, which led to multiple overdoses, which led to over half a million dollars in treatment bill. So, I was appointed as a victim member of the committee. It was something that I applied for. I had to go in and meet with the trustee and share my story. And, you know, the hardest part for me was I had to be impartial. You know, I'm someone who, prior to joining the committee, led -- co-led the largest protest in front of Purdue in 2018. I had called out the company and the Sacklers for years for their criminal actions. I had written about it. So, what I saw from the outside then moving on to the inside, it was just a completely different ball game. It was like knowing how to play football really well but then ending up on an ice-skating rink. You know, never skating once in your life. And I think it's important to note, too, that the Unsecured Creditor's Committee, you know, not only were we just this mega plaintiff, but we had broad powers, right? I mean, we subpoenaed records. We took depositions of the Sackler family. Our committee counsel and consultants reviewed millions of pages of documents. Many of the documents that you hear about that the, you know, House Oversight Committee has released and even some that serve attorney's general has put out there was the result of our work. It was the result of the work of our committee. We worked for over a year on discovery. And what we found was fascinating. SREENIVASAN: So, you were there on behalf of the 127,000 other individuals.

They lived with danger every day, often from generation to generation. But why they do keep doing it? Terry Hornbeck was a miner for 28 years until just a few months ago. When his best friend convinced him to get out. TERRY HORNBECK, MINER: He wanted me out of the mines. JOHNS: Because of the danger? Is that part of it. HORNBECK: I think in his mind, that's what it was, yeah. He thought that --",0.1853903164247992,2006-01-04

The NFL is set to enforce its toughest rules yet when players can return to practices or games after suffering head injuries or potential concussions. These new guidelines go into effect this week.

Joining us now from Morgantown, West Virginia is Dr. Julian Bales, chairman of neurology at the West Virginia School of Medicine, also the former team doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Dr. Bales, thank you for being with us this morning. DR. JULIAN BALES, WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Thank you. Good morning. CHETRY: First of all, break down for us, please what they're saying in terms of assessing concussions and how this policy means changes on the field? BALES: Well, the changes are that the patient cannot, or that the athlete cannot go back to play if he has any symptoms or signs of concussion, either during that game or practice. Also, he must later have a normal neurological examination, a normal neuropsychological examination and also be cleared by an independent physician who is not a part of the official medical staff of the team. So, four big changes that are new. CHETRY: Go ahead. BALES: In addition, you know, they emphasize rightly so that the player has to be candid. The player has to come forth, because many of the signs and symptoms of concussion, you don't know that. It's something that they're feeling, you can't see as a trainer or a coach or even a team physician. CHETRY: Right. It's something that the athlete",0.0181002560877775,2009-12-03

BOOKER: Sir, I've -- Yesterday, I broke these sham committee confidential rules and I accept full responsibility for what I'm doing.

If you look at the emails from the Democratic progressive groups, they love this. Republicans say, hey, wait a minute, you had no evidence of any improper contact with the Kasowitz law firm. That's innuendo. Cory Booker, you didn't really break the rules, you just kind of made a show there. A lot of Republicans are saying, you Democrats constantly say President Trump traffics in innuendo, traffics in fact-free arguments. Is that what they were doing there? OLORUNNIPA: A little bit. I mean. Democrats -- the Democratic base wants Democrats to show a fight on this issue, even if it's a losing fight. They are worried that there hasn't been enough fight in the Democrats. There hasn't been enough Trumpian action by the Democrats to take on President Trump, and I think that's probably what you saw with Senator Booker saying I'm breaking the rules and I'm showing some civil disobedience here. He wanted to show the Democratic base that he's willing to, you know, rough it up a little bit and be a little bit like the president who doesn't necessarily abide by the rules or state within -- color within the lines when it doesn't -- it's not seen as something that would help his party.

First of all, he said we're going to start seeing campaign staffers, these are field organizers, show up in key targeted states by the early spring. Axelrod also told John that the president is going to file the necessary paperwork to begin raising money by early April, and when John asked how much is it going to cost, how much are you going to have to spend on this campaign?

Meantime, sources tell CNN that Vice President Mike Pence has not ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President from office while some other Republicans are weighing even more legal options.

Also today, flags at the White House were finally lowered to half- staff, but so far no statement has been made as to why. Let's go first now to Capitol Hill where the second impeachment of President Trump could happen as soon as tomorrow. CNN's Sunlen Serfaty joining me now. So, Sunlen, what more do we know about this new Article of Impeachment? And what the process would be this week? SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the process, Fred, is exactly what House Democrats are trying to figure out at this moment. This certainly is a state of influx up here on Capitol Hill. Up here, things are very rigid right now because they're trying to figure out what the next steps will be, and I think that speaks to the complexity that Democrats are facing with the timing right now and how they pursue impeachment. Now, we do know that House Democrats will go ahead and move towards Article of Impeachment very likely this week, potentially voting as early as Wednesday. But there is some concern about potentially delaying that next step, sending it over to the Senate. Some Democrats are saying that that would be concerning because they are worried about the impact that a Senate impeachment trial would have on Biden's first day of his administration, the potential to delay nominations, the potential to delay things like a COVID relief package that the Biden administration has said that they are going to prioritize.

Throughout this trial he has smiled and he talks with the crowds as he\'s walking through.\n \n\n Literally dozens of people line up every day just to get a glimpse of him and just hope for a seat in the courthouse.\nThe courthouse is -- the courtroom actually is actually pretty small and so there\'s not a lot of room for spectators and people\nliterally line up first thing in the morning just to get a glimpse of him.\n \n\n FILAN: Is it because of what he\'s accused of committing is so heinous and gruesome or is it because he\'s so cute?\n \n\n BRADLEY: Well that\'s a question that\'s tough to answer. I mean I think that it is really sort of the outlaw factor of\nHugo Selenski. You know, there\'s these bodies found at his home and yet he\'s only been charged in two of the deaths and it\'s\nso interesting, because it was a home that he shared with his girlfriend at the time and out of all of the remains that they\nfound, which they have confirmed to be at least five, again, he\'s only been charged with two of those.\n \n\n FILAN: And if he is acquitted of this, is he just going to walk out of court a free man at the end of this case?\n \n\n BRADLEY: Well that\'s a question that we\'ve been debating amongst all of the reporters of course, and what we believe\nwill happen is that if he is found not guilty on these two charges, that the district attorney will be ready to slap him with\na couple of other charges.\n \n\n FILAN: Amy, stay with us.

Why many are pushing for volunteers to be exposed directly to the coronavirus to speed up the development of a vaccine. And cyber spies. The U.S. charges Chinese hackers with trying to steal research about a coronavirus vaccine. For the first time in two weeks the daily death toll in the United States has passed 1,000. That pushes the country's total past 141,000, almost four million confirmed cases. Experts say the real world numbers, though, could be a lot higher. One study from the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention found that in some places, infection rates were actually two to 24 times greater than the official count. The U.S. president is finally acknowledging the grim reality of this crisis. He's been playing down for months, In his first coronavirus briefing since April, he admitted things would likely get worse before they get better. And get this, encouraged everyone to wear a mask.

Fourteen Americans still held in Israel following Monday's bloody flotilla fight should be heading home by the end of the day today. That is according to Israeli officials. And our embassy in Tel Aviv says a total of 16 Americans were on board those six different ships that were raided in that predawn raid by Israeli commandos during a humanitarian mission to deliver supplies to the blockaded Gaza Strip. Now we're told two of the U.S. citizens have already left. In fact, we talked to one of them on the show this time yesterday morning. Now Israel says it is trying to empty its prison cells of all foreign flotilla activists by today. That is some 600-plus people to be cleared out but Israeli sources say four of the passengers will not get out until next week, all of them Israeli Arabs. And it's still not yet clear if any of the activists will face criminal charges. Still the ripple effect from Monday's deadly raid is being felt all around the world. You've seen the pictures of these protesters. Look at this. They've been storming city streets. Allies up in arms here. And a U.S. military official tells CNN that Turkey now informally backing out of trilateral military exercises set for August with both the U.S. and Israel. Keep in mind all of this coming as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is urging Israel to make what she's calling a credible internal investigation. Well, we now know that at least nine people are dead, but the facts about what exactly went down on that flotilla Monday morning still not totally clear. And it certainly was not even the first flotilla to try to break through that three-year blockade. In fact, more aid ships are heading toward Gaza right now. So the question is why did this particular mission end in gunfire? Senior international correspondent Matthew Chance spoke exclusively with the Israeli Navy commando seen on the video being attacked and thrown overboard and he's joining us live from Jerusalem. And, Matthew, I spoke with the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. just yesterday and I know they're all saying look, this was self- defense. MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. That's certainly, Brooke, what the Israelis have been saying all along, that they arrived on this protest ship, albeit in international waters. They were expecting to be, you know, greeted with peaceful protesters, but that's not what they encountered at all. The protesters of course say that's not true. They say that the Israeli soldiers behaved aggressively. But you mentioned, I sat down with one of the Israeli soldiers -- the commandos who was injured in this raid that clearly went quite badly wrong. He described to me a very ugly scene when he arrived. What emerged from that interesting conversation was that, you know, these soldiers had no idea to expect the kind of violent resistance that they encountered on board that",0.0298335922166431,2010-06-02

So there are going to be questions going forward about whether or not the President's tweets had an influence over this. He is denying directly being involved. But, Wolf, a lot of people follow the President on Twitter, you can see those tweets and surely the Justice Department can read them. BLITZER: Yes. The President says the whole prosecution was ridiculous. The President saying that publicly. We just heard him say that, and now all four federal prosecutors have resigned. Jake, this is an amazing development that raises questions about the Justice Department's independence. TAPPER: It sure does. I mean, the reason Lady Justice has a blindfold over is because she's not supposed to be able to see whether or not it's one of the President's friends and cronies who's being prosecuted or not. That's obviously not what's going on. And if you look at legal documents, the four prosecutors, Wolf, are Jonathan Kravis, Michael Marando, Aaron Zelinsky, and Adam C. Jed. And Dana, all four of them are now gone, all four of them resigning in protest. BASH: That's right. There's nobody left from the Justice Department who went to trial and took Roger Stone to trial who was still working at the Justice Department. Wait until we learn what the backstory is here. I mean, it's got to be something the fact that this happened. And just one more thing, just to add to what Kaitlan was saying. The President saying, I don't get involved. I mean, on its face, given what he said in a tweet publicly. We need to say that over and over again, that was getting involved. TAPPER: Yes. No, it's laughable on its face. Let's bring in James Baker, former General Counsel for the FBI. And well first of all -- JAMES BAKER, FORMER FBI GENERAL COUNSEL: And federal prosecutor -- TAPPER: And former federal prosecutor. First of all, what's your reaction to the resignation? Second, what's your reaction to what the President did? BAKER: The prosecutors did the right thing. I'm extremely proud of them. They held up the institution of the Department of Justice, the standards and traditions of Department of Justice, this kind of meddling, while the President has this power under the Constitution, while the Attorney General and main justice have this power, to do it in this way. And to meddle in a case like this is way outside the normal bounds of what should be done, especially in a case like this that has such political overtone. So I think they absolutely did the right thing. And this is what people need to do if they are not -- if they find the President's conduct unacceptable. People need to not go along with it.

Well, we know that there has been this explosive eruption at the main crater of the summit of Kilauea and it is sending a massive ash plume into the air. And authorities are saying that it is expecting to -- expected to blanket the area in ash. The last time this happened just two days ago, the ash was nearly half an inch thick. It is not clear whether this explosion is any bigger or around the same. We're still trying to find out that information. But the local authorities are saying that this could perhaps reach Hilo, which is a, you know, an hour drive from where this crater is. The winds right now are blowing in southeasterly direction, which is actually into a lot of places that are inhabited. In fact, we were just in the southeast where you're seeing a lot of those fissures open up in the earth, you know, sending out that sulfur dioxide gas. And on the way there, it was quite cloudy when we are in that direction, the southeast, and it is not clear whether that's from the crater, from the explosion, from something else. But we hadn't seen that before, and, you know, that it was quite foggy ahead and that's all you could smell is just that rotten egg smell. It is raining here, so I'm not sure whether that's putting, you know, a damper for lack of a better term, on this ash plume, but -- and visibility is quite low. So it's not exactly clear to me at this point how big it is. I'm trying to get in touch with my contacts on volcano. But as you know, it's just after 6:00 in the morning here, and the one woman that I called who lives in volcano was just waking up and she was worried about making sure that her water tanks didn't get contaminated. I was the first to alert her. She said that she thought she heard something when she was sleeping but she wasn't sure exactly what it is. As you know, people here, they are on edge. They are waiting for the big one. Of course, they are used to earthquakes which have been happening constantly for the past two weeks. They are expected to continue to happen, and they are used to the odd explosion, eruption, inside the main crater at Kilauea, but they're not used to earthquakes of this volume and they're not used to explosions that are this big and send this much ash into the sky. So a lot of people right now are doing what they can to prepare, to cover things, expecting that there's going to be ash, to make sure that things are on the ground in the event of a big earthquake.

Sally's strength left these homes destroyed, bringing down trees and power lines. And even leaving this boat shipwrecked on what was once land, several miles away from where it was originally docked. Its owners say they rode out the storm onboard. ZACH HOOD, DIRECTOR, BALDWIN COUNTY, ALABAMA, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY: The biggest thing that was catastrophic for us was how slow Hurricane Sally moved across our community, and it had very devastating consequences. LAVANDERA: Some cities like Orange Beach, Alabama, are enforcing curfews until further notice. MAYOR TONY KENNON, ORANGE BEACH, ALABAMA: It was an unbelievably freaky right turn of a storm that none of us ever expected. We're going to attack this thing, and we're going to get our city back running just like it should be.

Cesar Sayoc Jr, 56 years old, living in Florida, outside of Miami, but with ties to New York as well, and an extensive criminal background, including bomb threats in the early 2000s. Shimon Prokupecz, you are getting more information on this suspect. What else are you learning? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME & JUSTICE REPORTER: Wolf, a couple of tidbits of information. The suspect, once police learned of him and realized he could be the man they have been looking for, they used a cell phone to track him and used a cell phone to help and pinpoint his whereabouts, tying him to some of the locations that they have been interested in in south Florida. We are told that DNA was used and forensic evidence was used to tie him to the devices. You can see here quite quickly that law enforcement gathered a lot of information on the suspect, his whereabouts and where he has been, his connections to south Florida. Really key elements that have built this case that have allowed prosecutors to file charges against him. He is quite an interesting guy, but we don't know much about him. He's Ga a huge social media presence. Plenty of video and Facebook account and other social media accounts that law enforcement have been poring through. He has a criminal history, He's in his 50s. There's a lot that law enforcement knows that we are gathering and putting together. But they've learned a lot about him, certainly, as to motive and his mind set, and things that may have caused him to do what he was doing. And all of this hopefully we will learn more when the court documents get unseal and we can read through them and see exactly what law enforcement knows and how they put it together. As we know, this 2:30 press conference. Hopefully, we'll learn more there as well. BLITZER: I suspect we will learn a lot about this individual in the coming hours. Shimon, thank you very much. Several of the suspicious packages ended up in New York. That includes a package stopped by investigators in a mail sorting facility in Manhattan. That package addressed to both the former director of intelligence, James Clapper, and to CNN. That mail sorting facility only a few blocks from the Time Warner Center where CNN's offices in New York are located. Joining us is the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo. Governor, thanks once again for joining us. First, give us your reaction. I assume you have been fully briefed on the arrest of the suspect. GOV.

He e-mailed an official at the Defense Department back in August, saying, quote, ""clear direction from PO TUS to continue to hold."" Now, you can understand why ""The New York Times"" and other outlets would want to see these e-mails. I mean, this implies a direct link to the president. That's POTUS, right? SARAH ISGUR, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: And this is why Democrats in the Senate are so interested in having witnesses, like Michael Duffy, there. What I think the White House might be actually fairly clever in doing is without the Articles of Impeachment having been transmitted and without the rules having been agreed to between McConnell and Schumer, they need all the chips in their corner they have to trade. I think that someone, like Collin, someone like Murkowski, who have been the moderate Republicans who've said they're not sure whether they want to call witnesses or not, are going to definitely want to see these e-mails. And so, it is something they can trade in exchange for not having Duffy testify, for example. So, I wouldn't be surprised if we see this used as a trade, a chip (ph) down the road by the White House and by Senate Republicans even. GOLODRYGA: Daniel, do you think this -- do you agree? I mean, do you think this puts more pressure on seeing more of these e-mails? And, in that case, are you going to see Democrats now demanding that we do have witnesses? LIPPMAN: Yes, you already saw Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praise the reporting that led to some of the e-mails that we've already seen. And if you actually saw one of those e-mails from Robert Blair, who is Mick Mulvaney's national security adviser -- GOLODRYGA: He predicted. LIPPMAN: Yes, he said this is going to be a major issue in Congress. GOLODRYGA: Right. Right. LIPPMAN: And one of those e-mails from Michael Duffy of OMB, to the Pentagon's general -- you know, one of their top lawyers, said that, I'm glad this is behind us. And when the aid finally got released right as the whistle-blower complaint was made -- being made public. And so, they, clearly, knew this was -- ISGUR: Famous last words. LIPPMAN: -- yes. They, clearly, knew this was a political hot potato. GOLODRYGA: Yes. LIPPMAN: And there were a lot of concerns at DOD they were going to violate the law by holding that money. GOLODRYGA: I mean, I have a theory. Mick Mulvaney, when he came out a few months ago and said, yes, that it was quid pro quo . Get over it. Deal with it. People were stunned by that. But I have a theory that, perhaps, he knew that we'd be here in a few months. So, why not just come out and admit it back then? But that's just my theory. He hasn't said that.

The ankle can be a very serious injury, because it's an area of the body, that doesn't get as good a blood supply, so it can take longer to heal. It obviously is bearing a lot of the weight, most of the weight. So there's all these things to take into consideration. But I will say again, five back surgeries, and the guy was still playing at the level that he was, I don't want to overstate that, but I'm just saying the guy has clearly come back from some - from some significant operations in the past.

CUOMO: The only thing that matters tonight for Tiger Woods, and the many who care about him, is that he's alive, and that he's going to get another chance at this. And if anybody's going to break our expectations of what this injury can do to you, it would likely be Tiger Woods. But this could be a moment that winds up deciding the future of a one-man sports dynasty, at least in terms of his play. I want to bring in just one of the greats from the art of broadcast and communication, Bryant Gumbel. He's going to come in, and I want to talk to him about, you know, Tiger Woods means more than golf. He means more than sport. We are covering this accident, because it happened to him.

Now, the interesting thing will be what will this moment matter to him, in terms of his legacy, as one of the greatest sports icons of all time. I want perspective from somebody who knows the man and also knows his meaning. Legendary journalist, he's been following Woods' career, got a great clip for you tonight, of Bryant Gumbel, with Tiger Woods, at 5.

If anybody can recover from a couple of compound fractures, it's this guy. We've seen him come through worse, frankly. Why does he matter so much to us in this culture?

BLITZER: Yes, he certainly understands, Gloria Borger, how things work in Washington. And it worked for him. There is a Special Counsel. GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: That's right. Well, he wasn't born yesterday. He's been around Washington a long time as Dana point out. And he chose his words carefully today. I mean, when he said in his opening that the president -- they were defaming him and he said those were lies, plain and simple. And then he went on to describe these meetings, Wolf, in which he made it very clear that when the president said I hope you can get rid of this investigation, whatever the quote was, that he said I took it as a direction. This is what he wants me to do. Now, it's up to the Special Counsel to decide whether, in fact, you know, that constitutes obstruction and perhaps it's up to the Congress in a political sense. But he also said, and he intimated this, quid pro quo that he thought was going on, on the part of the president which is, you asked Comey to stay and you didn't get anything for it. And he said, he asked for his loyalty in terms of the context of getting him to do what he wanted. In other words, you get to stay in your job if you behave the way I want you to behave. And I think that's pretty damming. He wouldn't comment specifically on obstruction because he did not want to do that. But I think when he said that that he took this as direction and outlined this kind of quid pro quo, I think it's very damming. BLITZER: He said that the words from the president and other White House officials about why he had been fired were lies, plain and simple, and he wanted to get the record straight. He also said that Michael Flynn, the fired National Security adviser, was in legal jeopardy. JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Was in legal jeopardy and later on he said -- he was asked specifically about his statements to the FBI, do you have any reason to believe he gave false statements to the FBI and he said that's one of the reasons he was under criminal investigation. A number of significant things. One, this won't get much attention because it's in the rearview mirror but a pretty damming account from Jim Comey there about Loretta Lynch, the former attorney general in the Obama administration and her handling of the Clinton e-mail investigation.

You see, Angela Merkel there with Hollande. Let me get back to you, Senator, on this. If you put boots -- if you put boots, if you put intelligence on the ground, how does that stop what Attorney General Holder called, the lone wolves, the folks who are being radicalized over the internet, as Senator Feinstein was talking about... MCCAIN: Mm-hmm. BORGER: ...those people who are uneducated perhaps, maybe poor, maybe looking for some kind of salvation in another world? And how will that... MCCAIN: Mm-hmm. BORGER: ...stop those people, because that's what some folks are saying the Kouachi brothers may have been? And how can you combat all of the activity and what the British director of intelligence called, all those dark places? MCCAIN: Well, first of all, we have to have every Muslim cleric in the world, especially in the West, condemn this as a violation of the Koran, and an honorable and decent religion. That has to happen and it hasn't been happening. Second thing is obviously we have to again (ph) try to track these people, but look, it's a threat, the lone wolf. It is a serious threat, but that's far different from sleeper cells manned by people who were trained as one of these young men was in Yemen, the success -- Yemen. Trained in Yemen and trained -- and they'll be trained -- and they're training them right now in Syria, where we have refused to help the Free Syrian Army. They're killing more than we are training, and that we have to go to the heart of it, because there's one thing to have a lone wolf, and that's bad. But far worse is a person who has been trained and equipped and sent on a specific mission. That's where you get the big attacks. BORGER: And Senator, this female suspect as we know is probably on her way to Syria, if she's not there already. MCCAIN: Yes, and obviously there was at least some training. The nature of that attack showed a degree of professionalism that no lone wolf could have carried out. And right now, in training camps throughout particularly Syria, where we are leaving Bashar al-Assad alone with some incredible hope that the Iranians will work with us, which is bizarre, but right now in Syria, they are training people to go back to the country they came from, and commit acts of terror. That was the view of the head of British intelligence, not just mine. BORGER: OK.

And Schiff is trying as Sara pointed out is trying to stop and delay and maybe get another vote on this. SCIUTTO: Let's be fair here though Michael Bender, it seems that the motivations here of a Nunes and other house Republicans are very similar or perhaps identical to the White House. This is part of a broader effort we've seen unfold over many months to undermine the credibility of the FBI and the Russia investigation. MICHAEL BENDER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: That is right. For one there is the tension between the legislative and the executive branch is always there. If you sort of consider the FBI the as the executive branch here. They're taking the position they did everything with the FISA warrants right. Nunes and Republicans are raising questions about that. And really the tensions between an FBI and a President aren't all that unusual. What's unusual here is sort of the frequency that Trump has inserted himself in this and the -- the public battle that this has become here, right. SCIUTTO: Right. BENDER: And I can tell you inside the White House they are furious right now with the FBI and with the Department of Justice. They see the leaks over the last few days as coming directly from them, which is you know something to sort of for the White House to identify other people as leakers is quite a moment here. But the Monday meeting where Wray and Rosenstein came over to the White House, made a private plea, there was only a few White House officials in that meeting, Don McGahn was one of them White House counsel. John Kelly was chief of staff, and to have the meeting leak out a day later has infuriated the White House and now we're at the point where the FBI is putting out public unsigned statements urging the White House to take a specific action. SCIUTTO: Right. To be fair, there is not only one building in Washington that is leaking on this story for sure. BENDER: Absolutely. SCIUTTO: There are a lot of axes to grind.

I yield the floor. JOHN ROBERTS, CNN ANCHOR: That's Senator Barack Obama voicing his support for the economic bailout plan, which will go to a Senate vote shortly after sundown tonight. He was saying that this is going to take some sacrifice, it's not going to solve all of the problems, but it's time to do what's right, imploring holdout Democrats and Republicans to sign onto this bill. And he, like President Bush and others, insisting that over the long-term, this is not going to cost the taxpayers any money, that eventually the $700 billion will all be paid back. And that is a point of contention for many, many people, who believe that what they're calling the biggest bailout in the history of this nation will, in fact, end up costing the taxpayers a lot of money. We do know that Senator John McCain is in the District of Columbia, the nation's capital, right now, and will be making his way over later on, at least to vote. We do not know if he will be making a floor speech, as Senator Obama did but -- just now. But we will guarantee that if he does while we're on the air here at THE SITUATION ROOM, we will bring it to you live. Also, interesting to note that for either Senator Obama or John McCain, depending on the results of the November 4th election, it could be the last time today that they ever make a speech from the floor of the Senate. The Senate is expected to go into recess shortly after this bailout bill is dealt with and very unlikely for a sitting president to address the Senate from the Senate floor. Of course, they do address senators, but that's typically in a joint session in Congress, which takes place in the House. The senators will vote on the Wall Street bailout bill tonight. It's going to be the first time that they've voted in the Senate in a while, by the way. McCain's last roll call vote was April the 8th, to advance a foreclosure prevention bill that finally passed. McCain has missed 173 Senate votes this year. Obama last voted on July the 9th to advance a Medicare bill to a final vote. It did finally pass. Obama has missed 137 Senate votes this year. And Joe Biden's last vote vas July the 31st, to adjourn the Senate. Biden has missed 33 votes this year.

Coming up here on CNN, President Trump, who once truly trashed China on the campaign trail over its trade practices, now says, quoting him, he doesn't blame China for taking advantage of the U.S. Is this the art of the deal playing out in action in this part of the country? And will it make any difference on issues of trade and pressuring China with regard to North Korea? We'll take you live there next. Also, troubling details about the Texas church massacre. The gunman telling a former colleague why he used to buy animals off Craigslist. And moments from now the Air Force is expected to hold a news conference.

If they do that in the future, maybe there could be better relations, but right now I don't see that happening. Despite the recent diplomatic efforts by Washington and Tehran, it will take more time and more trust building to overcome almost 37 years of animosity. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN: So as you can see, Hala, there are still a lot of divisions in Iranian society. There is also divisions of course in Iranian politics as well and there are a lot of things that could derail the process that's been going on with Iran and the west really coming closer to one another over the past couple of months, of course, the U.S. as well. But then there is this large potential and I can tell you when you fly into this country, the planes are absolutely packed with businessmen from the west looking to cash in on a market that they believe will thrive very shortly -- Hala. GORANI: I think a lot of deals will be signed over the next several years, certainly some money to be made. Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran where it's almost midnight. Thanks for being with us, Fred.

A young Chinese boy with a debilitating handicap is just hours away from starting a new life in America. You may remember a Kansas City family raised enough money to adopt 9-year- old Jiajia after a CNN report led to a flood of donations. Will Ripley picks up the story five months later as Jiajia meets his new parents. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Wilsons have been waiting almost a year to make the 6,600 mile journey from Kansas City to Beijing. The boy they're about to meet has been waiting his whole life. We first met Jiajia last summer, the oldest orphan in a Chinese foster home for kids with disabilities.

RIPLEY: Brian and Jeri Wilson had been trying for months to adopt him, but they needed $36,000, money they didn't have. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right after the story aired, I think it was 8:00 that night, we've met our goal. RIPLEY: Donations came in from all over the world. The Wilsons raised almost $50,000 in a matter of hours. Five more months of paperwork and today they finally meet their son. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As soon as",0.5553999848633921,2016-01-22

I don't know about your family, but we didn't really give gifts last year. So people really want to give gifts and gifting is going to be something that, you know, people are going to be doing not just in this season, but year round. This is according to TOBE Doneger Group. So the, you know, this people are going out and wanting to spend this. But to your point, Oracle came out with a study and 77 percent of consumers are worried that supply chain is going to those issues are going to have an impact on whether or not they're going to get the gifts. So, you are going to see a rise of people going into the stores, but also that concern about whether or not they're going to get the gifts if they do end up shopping online. DEAN: And so let's talk through some of the supply chain issues. You've talked about how there's -- people are going to feel this differently, or corporations and businesses are going to feel this differently. If you're a big box store, like we just heard Alison talking about. If you're a Macy's, you can hire, you know, a ship to get your merchandise around the world, that's harder for a mom and pop store or a local business. So how will the supply chain issue be affecting different types of businesses? HERZOG: Right, the supply chain issue is certainly bifurcated. And those big box stores are going to fair well, simply because they have the capital to hire private barges to ship that stuff in on time and hire private trucking companies, the small mom and pop stores. And I always think about the store that is in this beach town I go to every summer that sells Christmas items, they -- those stores are going to be the ones that are most affected, because to try to get the merchandise out from the cargo, the cargo ships in that are docked in Los Angeles and in Long Beach is very, very expensive. And in addition to the fact, ports are charging these stores and retailers to store this merchandise, so they can't get the merchandise out. But they're also getting charged. This is a lot of overhead costs and could potentially decimate some of these small businesses that take this time because three months leading up to holiday to really make a lot of the revenues. DEAN: Right. And so for people at home, who maybe want to go out shopping, you know, a lot of people to your point do want to do big this year. They want to buy the presents. They want to go out and experience everything. What should they be keeping in mind? Because we're talking about supply chain issues and inflation. What",0.4764537576660139,2021-11-26

CLARK: Well, I think that we're going to have to have -- we and the military would call and after action review to determine what happened, why it happened, and how it happened, and how to do it better -- how to make it different the next time. But what I would caution is that we can't run this kind of an investigation. The United States can't, by only focusing on the low level intelligence officials and the intelligence operating processes. Because there was information available. It did reach higher level officials. And you know, what we found in the United States army, when we have an operation we always do an after action review, we go right to the top. The commander participates in that after action review. It's about him and what he does, just like it's all the staff officers and all of the subordinate commanders.

Now, there's a second recall going on, and that is this accelerator, the gas pedal, that tends to get stuck in -- in an accelerated position, causing problems with -- with stopping. That's a separate recall. Let me show you if your car's involved in this: the 2005 to 2010 Avalon; the 2009 to 2010 Matrix or Pontiac Vibe; 2008 to 2010 Sequoia; 2007 to 2010 Tundra. There are more of these: The 2007 to 2010 Camry, certain of these models. Certain 2009 to 2010 Corollas; certain 2010 Highlanders and certain 2009 to 2010 RAV4s. Again, it would behoove you to phone Toyota or your dealer to make sure it's -- your car's in the recall and to find out what you're supposed to do. There are some exceptions and cars that are not involved in this recall, but there are, as you can see, many that are. Now, what exactly do you do if you do own one of the cars on the list that I just -- I just showed you? Well, you contact your Toyota dealer, and you'd expect phones to be ringing off the hook right now. So we sent CNN's Susan Candiotti to a location, a Toyota dealership in -- in New Jersey. She's there now for us -- Susan. SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Ali. Well, as you look over my shoulder here, you can see that the service bay here, filled with cars. The thing is, all the ones that you see right here are mainly rentals, a few others. And the reason for that is this: Toyota only now is starting to instruct all the mechanics on how to make the fixes that you were just describing. So, for example, at this particular dealership, it was only this morning that they sent a couple of their top mechanics to learn how to do that repair. One of those, Mike Gates, he just finished up that training, and now he is here working on a car. Again, these are mainly rentals they're starting to work on now, until they can get the customers in. Mike, show us what exactly what we're looking at -- what you will be repairing. MIKE GATES, MECHANIC: This is the accelerator pedal, and we'll be putting the bar right in the back. CANDIOTTI: It was loose; it was loosened up a little bit now, right? GATES: Yes. CANDIOTTI: We're coming around to get a better -- a better shot of that. Let's come around to the other side so we can get a closer look at that replacement bar that he's putting in there, that reinforcement bar, as you put it. All right.

I heard great dismay, great pain, a great urging. Surely, there must be a new configuration, so we get away from this idea of occupying forces. And I don't want to have to say that. I would prefer that we were looking forward, because I have in front of my mind the real human rights agenda, which is the people, the children, the elderly, women in Iraq. They are the people that really matter in this, and they ... CLANCY: But you ask them, you ask them, and they say, what we need is security. And that doesn't mean .... ROBINSON: Right. CLANCY: These forces have to come from somewhere. The Iraqis are being trained, it's being accelerated to put them into that position. Do you support that? ROBINSON: Well, let's put this way: Because I have such a focus on human rights agenda, any formula that will really work is what I am looking for. I just know in my heart, and know from so many comments of those on the ground in the region human rights people, it's sadly unlikely unless there is a new configuration. It's helpful that there is a commitment to an Iraqi government by next July, but the way in which it's coming about may not be stable. I don't know. I mean, I would prefer to focus on the broader human rights agenda. What I heard from these Arab women and a man, of the steps that they are taking to ensure that there is in that region a more human rights approach. But honestly, what's happening in Iraq is not helpful at the moment. CLANCY: What are the specifics those women talked about? ROBINSON: They talked about the need to have a universal standard of human rights, and then a good cultural diversity. It was a wonderful discussion, an intercultural discussion. They don't want to be squeezed between extremist Islam religion and denying women a right to work, a right to do, to fulfill their aspirations. Nor do they want to be a part of what they called the McDonald's culture, which is a sort of a shorthand for a very western style. They want as women, with the spirituality of the Islam religion, to use the universal code (ph) to help them to achieve their rights. That's what women in Afghanistan want as well. And it's a wonderful moment in that sense for human rights, that so many women individually, like the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Shirin Ebadi, it was a wonderful example. And there are thousands of Arab women who need our understanding and support. And in a way, there is a new revolution of concern and focus on economic, social and cultural rights.

So, within hours of Whelan being, you know, allowed a visitor, he's there, and you say that means this is a crisis. ROBERT BAER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE: Oh, it's definitely a crisis, Erin. The ambassador never does a prison visit, almost never. It's always a vice consul goes in, checks his welfare, makes sure he has a lawyer, talks to the prison guards, makes sure he's got his medicine and it's that simple. Sending an ambassador is signaling to the Russians that we're very worried about this, and as a matter of fact, I've never -- can recall an incident where an ambassador goes in for the initial visit. BURNETT: I mean, Juliette, what do you think is going on here? If Bob's saying he can never recall a situation like this, that this is being escalated so quickly. JULIETTE KAYYEM, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY, HOME AND SECURITY DEPARTMENT UNDER OBAMA: It is. It's both being escalated but we do have to understand that in these hostage situations, that the -- you want some quiet. In other words, you don't want everything to be public. Lots of things are going on. There's family interests, there's political interests in this case, so when Huntsman says, you know, I can't talk about everything, I'm somewhat sympathetic to that. What this does tell me, just consistent with Bob, is we've ratcheted up immediately and we did so because this is clearly a -- not just a hostage situation. It's clearly, in my mind, a political hostage situation. So, Russians have been signaling after Butina was taken, let alone the fact that she is cooperating, which has got to be terrifying to Putin. BURNETT: Maria Butina, who pled guilty to spying. Yes. KAYYEM: Exactly, and she's cooperating now, that they have been signaling that wouldn't it be interesting to take or maybe a good tit- for-tat would be to take an American citizen and that's what they've done now, and the solution is only going to be a political solution. This is not a legal issue. BURNETT: Well, I mean, you've used the word hostage a couple times here. This is a serious word, Bob. Do you agree? Hostage? BAER: Oh, I agree with Juliette. He's not a spy. I mean, he could have been freelancing on something dumb but the Russians would know that and wouldn't have arrested him. They would have expelled him, not let him in the country, something like that. They know he's not a spy. So, it's a hostage situation and they're probably worried about what Butina has said about her mission here, that there could be other indictments, who knows what they're worried about. But Putin, at the end of the day, looks at Butina as a hostage herself because she wasn't properly spying. She wasn't collecting, stealing secrets.

All of that just adds to the picture of an interconnected terrorist network with the ability to share resources, personnel, expertise and trade crafts in a way that serves as a multiplier to their own capabilities. And that's a disturbing trend. If ISIS and al Qaeda have been degraded as the administration insists, how is it possible, Paul, for this threat to keep growing? And I guess the other question is, and it gets to this encountering violent extremism a summit that the President and the White House is going to be holding later on this week. I guess the key is to stop the flow of these fighters coming and stop the flow of these reinforcements coming in. And Paul, you've looked at this issue. How do we go about doing that? Sounds like a generational challenge. BAER: Well, it's going to be very tough. Because right now about 1,000 foreign fighters joining ISIS and other groups in Syria and Iraq every month. Many of them are traveling through into Turkey. And obviously you can try and stop them from trying to travel. The Turks are cracking down to some degree. But if young men want to travel to Syria and Iraq and young women as well, it's quite difficult to stop them because of course Turkey is such a big holiday destination. How do you know who's going there for a beach vacation or who wants to go and fight jihad in Syria and Iraq is a pretty porous border as well. So, there's a limited amount you can do to stop this people travelling. Of course, the big worry is about the people coming back. More than 750 have returned to Europe. Fewer have returned to the United States. Perhaps a dozen or so. But we were told on Friday, on Wolf's show, Senator Rich saying some of those who return to the United States are actually ISIS fighters. So a concern about the terrorist threat from ISIS in the United States. And concern as well that ISIS is now pivoting towards launching attacks against the west. With that plot in Brussels last month which the Belgium authorities believe was orchestrated by the ISIS leadership, they believe that was going to be a major spectacular attacks that they were planning there. The belief now is that ISIS are pivoting towards launching attacks in the west. This is a group with very conservative resources. Up to thousand westerners in their ranks. Tens of millions of dollars of cash reserves. All those training camps, bomb experts who can provide that training. So I think there's a lot of worry about the terrorist threat. It's an unprecedented terrorist threat in Europe right now. Bigger than in any time ever. Yes. Before 9/11, after 9/11 from the European perspective.

These are public health measures that we have to do more of to be able to control the spread. HOLMES: I was curious what you thought, you know. HOLMES: You are in the system. Do you think this pandemic has exposed some real holes and failures in the public health system? Not the professionals who are in it but the system itself, things from preparedness to equipment and also, it has to be mentioned that the issue of who is not insured in this country. I read the words of a doctor today who said they had a patient, he told them he needed a ventilator and the man was gasping for air. He said who is going to pay for it? What has coronavirus exposed about the system? MAHAJAN: In our system, we have inequalities and those inequalities relate to people's access to health care and people's insurance status. The pandemic only exacerbates and magnifies those inequalities.

And we know that when a person who has, say, diabetes or asthma or heart disease, gets the virus. It is harder for them to fight it off. HOLMES: That's a very important point. Those are the people who don't have access for financial reasons, usually, to health care. We don't know if this will have a seasonal component for sure, correct me if I'm wrong, but the real impacts have been in the Northern Hemisphere. Do you worry about the impacts in the Southern Hemisphere when the colder months begin and then coming back again in the north? MAHAJAN: Absolutely. I think we all are learning so much about this novel virus, that there is so much more that we need to know. At this point, the modeling suggests that we are not necessarily out of the woods in the warmer months, even in the Northern Hemisphere. Modeling suggests here in Southern California, by August, even if we were to maintain our stay-at-home orders through the summer, some 30 percent of the population is likely to have contracted the virus. So these are large numbers, even through the warmer months. HOLMES: Sobering but important to know. Dr. Anish Mahajan, thank you so much in Los Angeles. I appreciate it. MAHAJAN: Thank you.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's hard for me, going away from my friends and teachers and stuff. And then when I have to move, I have to make new friends just to make up for them.

O'BRIEN: In the meantime, they make do, grilling burgers on their makeshift patio, playing basketball wherever they can. It's children, like Eric Jr. whom Harvard professor Roland Fryer (ph) is trying so hard to reach. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're dealing with, you know, neighborhoods where they see drug dealing happening. There's violence in the neighborhoods. Some of the neighborhoods aren't safe. So what we are trying to do for these kids is give -- afford them the same opportunity as they would have if they grew up in a middle-class neighborhood. O'BRIEN (on camera): How do you make that connection between material wealth and education? How come the middle class people with middle class children and middle class values have been able to make that connection very clearly and here they struggle? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think if you grew up in a middle class family, education is tangible because it's all around you. You've got an investment banker uncle. You've got someone else who is in advertising. They all went to college, et cetera. If you live in some of the poorer neighborhoods of the United States, you don't see those examples to light the way. O'BRIEN (voice-over): The U.S. Census Bureau reports that one- third of all black children live below the poverty line, compared to just a tenth of white children. And according to NYU professor Pedro Nogera (ph), poverty has a direct impact on the quality of education in America today. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We consistently spend the least amount of money to educate poor kids, particularly kids of color, and so black children are concentrated in schools with the fewest resources. O'BRIEN: A different school with fewer resources is what Eric Kennedy Sr. now worries about on top of having to find a new home. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm just hoping I do find something or I'll be forced to be homeless. You know, me and the kids would have to go back into the shelter system. O'BRIEN: Eric Jr. is wise beyond his 10 years. While he has saved more than $150 in Fryer's school incentive program, he plans to give half to his dad to help pay bills. The rest is for the future.

TODD (voice-over): Despite the pageantry and promise at the Singapore summit last year, when Kim made his initial vague promise to get rid of his nuclear weapons, despite the dramatic images at the DMZ and words of friendship, by CNN's count, North Korea has made no fewer than 12 direct or implied threats since Singapore to pull out or walk back from the diplomatic process. Even as Kim appears to maintain his personal connection to Trump. DEAN CHENG, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW OF THE ASIAN STUDIES CENTER, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: I think that the spin that is occurring from Pyongyang is any concessions that do occur are because of their threats. Second of all, there does seem to be this belief on the part of Kim Jong-un that he and Trump may actually have some kind of relationship. TODD (voice-over): Still, analysts say while North Korea may not be planning to get rid of its nuclear program any time soon, the idea it could restart testing soon may be less of a solid promise and more of an empty threat. GREEN: I think they probably won't do it. China would come down on them very, very hard. For now, they're getting a bit of a pass from the Chinese because they're engaged in dialogue. (END VIDEOTAPE) TODD: While the President shows patience with North Korea, his aides are sending a tougher signal to Pyongyang.

We ought to be drilling every bit of oil, getting all the coal out. We need to be going after our natural gas and biofuels and become the energy exporter to the world, and take the weaponry out of the hands of the Russians, the Iranians, and the Saudis by taking their money away, and let America become the number one energy exporter to the entire world. That enriches Americans and it destabilizes our enemies overseas. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Senator Graham. GRAHAM: It is absolutely imperative that Bashar Assad go. The biggest mistake Obama made was drawing a red line. Assad crossed it. He is still standing. If I'm president, Assad will not stand. He has murdered 240,000 of his own people. They're not going to accept him as their leader. The war never ends if he stays in power. You're giving Damascus to the Iranians. He's a puppet of the ayatollah, a proxy of Iran. He is the biggest benefactor of Hezbollah. Weapons flowing from Damascus to Lebanon will continue to flow if Assad stays. For our interests and the stability of the region, he must go. And if I'm president, he will go. And the Syrians will pick their leader, not the ayatollah. (APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Governor Huckabee. HUCKABEE: Well, the only thing I disagree with is that I still believe if you take away their ability to fund their weaponry and fund their terrorism, they don't have terrorism. I still say we need to take an offensive approach by using our energy, the one weapon we have, we have hundreds of years of energy under our feet. The president thinks that climate change is the number one enemy. I think people bombing us is a bigger enemy than the temperature change over several hundred years. So let's get our energy. Let's use that as an offensive weapon to change the dynamics of the entire globe, and especially change the dynamics of the Middle East.

Where\'s their plan and it was their plan that\'s caused the problem.\nHow do they go on a no plan strategy? CAPEHEART: Well, Rev, I think it will be a little easier for the Republicans to do\nthat because (1) President Obama is a Democrat and he is the one controlling the White House. (2) The White House has been\nsaying consistently over the last -- at least the last year, you know, the economy is coming back, all the indices are going\nin the right direction and it\'s just a matter of time before the American people feel it.

COSTELLO: That's true, but when things are brought up, I would think most mothers would want to know if their daughters are considering abortion and they would want the law to force their daughters to tell them or at least the doctors performing the abortions to let them know. That doesn't sound extreme. MCINTOSH: Sure, but mostly women voters don't want this issue to be the priority of our government. When you poll women whether they call themselves pro-choice or pro-life, they believe that the priority of their elected officials ought to be helping them out with the economic reality of their day to days. They want folks in Washington to be focused on jobs. The Republican Party has put this single-minded focus on social issues like abortion at their own expense. At Emily's List, we saw our membership quintuple during 2012 cycle. We added a million members during 2013. COSTELLO: If you take a look at the latest CNN/ORC poll, it shows opinions are shifting. When asked whether abortion should be legal in all circumstances, 25 percent said no, that's down from just a year ago. So you have to ask yourself the question, is it time to rethink our abortion laws? MCINTOSH: The majority of Americans feel that most abortions ought to be legal, but they also believe that this shouldn't be the single- minded focus of our government. The year is 2014. Republicans are still relitigating battles that we thought frankly our mother's generations had fought. They are expanding it beyond abortion. They have birth control limiting legislation. They want your boss to be able to decide whether you are taking it for appropriate reasons to get it covered. I mean, this agenda taken as a whole really tells women that the Republican Party doesn't respect their choices, doesn't think they are capable of making them themselves. It is why we are seeing women flee the Republican Party in droves and vote for Democratic candidates, many of whom are really strong women who are offering a very clear, compelling contrast to this extremist agenda.

Administration officials have been debating whether to send them in all at once as a big show of force, or phase them in for month to month, depending on whether the Iraqis meet certain military and political goals. Sources familiar with the deliberation say the phased-in approach seems to be winning the day. But lawmakers attending various meetings at the White House expressed reservations. REP. GEORGE MILLER (D), CALIFORNIA: Any request for additional troops is going to have to be accompanied by a very, very strong justification and, in fact, a detailed plan as to what would the purpose of that escalation of those troops be. MALVEAUX: The president is also considering sending some troops to Kuwait as a contingency force, as some Democrats have called for. The plan also includes a major economic component: an expected billion-dollar new jobs program to get Iraqis back to work, more State Department officials that will head to Iraq to coordinate reconstruction projects for the Iraqi companies.

MALVEAUX: Well, the thinking here at the White House, administration officials are saying, look, this is the last chance. And this is going to be a long-term effort. But they all acknowledge here, it's going to be a very tough sell. And this is something, the final push here, to see if this so-called surge is actually going to work while the Iraqis get their own political house in order. But Lou, there are some skeptics, of course, who are saying that they're not necessarily sure this is going to work. DOBBS: Suzanne, thank you very much. Suzanne Malveaux from the White House.

Both will make this more of a screaming act than a thoughtful campaign about policy. But more importantly, Bernie Sanders' socialist issue which, you know, the president will bring up again and again, that's half the problem. The bigger problem is the hypocrite issue I think. And as a white hot like of sort of front runner ship on him right now, when he's asked to explain socialism or he's asked about his gun votes and challenged by Bloomberg, it's kind of hard to explain the way socialism works because it doesn't work, and it's never worked. The math doesn't add up. It is going to get tougher and tougher. JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Look, there are so many crocodile tears about -- from Trumpists running against Bernie Sanders, because guess what? Spoiler alert, they want to run against Bernie Sanders. So, you know, Tim Scott, you can bring up parallels about play to the base populists that excite the base and that nobody thought would have a chance of being a president, and here they come in front-runner status. The parallels stop about there, particularly when you look at just basic electability. There's a reason Republican Republicans want to run against Bernie Sanders. He's their dream, he's their bumper sticker they have been running against in phantom form forever. He also makes something like Florida look less likely since the comments about Castro the other night. Look, we've had two caucuses, play to the folks do well there. We've had one primary in a state in a state where Sanders neighbors. South Carolina is going to be a big test. He pulled together an impressive win in Nevada. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. And after that, it's Super Tuesday. I would argue that the reason Democrats haven't gone after him, is because they're afraid of alienating his base. They realize he motivated a movement. TAPPER: Yes, that's probably true. AVLON: But that haven't worked yet. TAPPER: Melanie, South Carolina is really important not just for Bernie Sanders, it's really for Vice President Joe Biden.

200362,350262,CNN,American Morning,"SOLEDAD O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR: Santa Barbara County district attorney Tom Sneddon says he is, quote, ""discounting"" what could be considered another strike against his prosecution of Michael Jackson. A leaked memo from a child welfare agency says the current child molestation allegations against Jackson are unfounded. Joining us with reaction to this development is CNN legal analyst Chris Darden. He joins us from our Los Angeles bureau this morning. Chris, good morning. Nice to see you. CHRISTOPHER DARDEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Good morning. O'BRIEN: Let's get right into this memo. Now, according to the memo, the L.A. Department of Children and Family Services conducted their own investigation last February, and uses the word specifically ""unfounded"" when it comes to this specific case of molestation, and this specific little boy. The boy's mother, in fact, goes as far as saying that Michael Jackson is like a father to this boy. The boy's sisters saying she never observed anything untoward happening here. Give me an overall sense of how you think this will affect the prosecution of Michael Jackson on molestation charges, when those charges are officially filed. DARDEN: You know, I'd certainly have to agree with those who think that this is quite a bombshell, and quite a coup for the defense in this case. We've all been led to believe that the molestations occurred around February, or around the time that the Martin Brashear interview was aired. This memo seems to address directly those same allegations during that same period of time. And not only do you have the mother's statements, but apparently the children were interviewed and they also said that no molestation occurred during that time period. So that is a huge, huge, I think piece of information for the defense. Now, can the prosecution get beyond it? well, yes, they can. Children or child victims of child abuse often refuse to admit that they've been abused initially. And that's not uncommon. But I would think that given the stature of Michael Jackson, and the fact that a lot of people are very, very suspect and suspicious about these allegations, will seem to me that the prosecution is going to need some corroboration, some physical corroboration. They're going to need tapes, photographs, letters or writings of Michael Jackson's own hand, some kind of an admission. It will not be enough, in my opinion, to convict Michael Jackson solely on the basis of the testimony of this child victim or alleged victim, and his brother. O'BRIEN: At the same time, we hear from the Santa Barbara D.A.'s office that they actually sort of shrug their shoulders and say, this is not really a significant factor at all. Do you think that means or we should read into that, boy, they have a strong, tight case against Michael Jackson? DARDEN: Well, I'm not sure what to read into that. Apparently they knew about this investigation, and that's a good thing, and that's why I always admonish prosecutors to take their",0.8194961658955469,2003-12-10

When they walked in they were wearing this at arrivals; look at them: sexy, yet elegant; chic. They're really comfortable in their own skin and in their clothes. Then, later on they change for the stage. Then they changed again. Look at them; now they're in the glittery green numbers, but there's nothing threatening about them, they -- you know, this is a word that I very rarely use: ""ladies,"" in my line of work.

Netanyahu had a similar discussion with President Obama yesterday and then he topped off the evening by speaking at APAC, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: My friends, Israel has waited -- patiently waited for the international community to resolve this issue. We've waited for diplomacy to work. We've waited for sanctions to work. None of us can afford to wait much longer. (END VIDEO CLIP) O'BRIEN: The former chief of staff for Prime Minister Netanyahu, Naftali Bennett, joins us. Nice to have you with the panel. We appreciate your time this morning. NAFTALI BENNETT, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: It's great to be here. O'BRIEN: So describe for me where you think the main points of difference are between the Prime Minister and President Obama after their conversation of yesterday. BENNETT: I mean, I think the good news is that President Obama made it patently clear that it's in America's national interest to prevent Iran from going nuclear. That's the good news. The bad news is that amid these discussions words in Washington don't stop centrifuges in (INAUDIBLE). So chief inspector, Chief U.N. Inspector Amano reported just now that Iran has tripled the pace of production of 20 percent enriched uranium, installed 2,600 new centrifuges underground during the past few months. So the main problem is that the current sanctions are too slow and too soft to stop Iran and that means that we're not going to be able to prevent the need for an attack. And that's the main point of difference. O'BRIEN: The new word out today was that Iran says they are going to allow nuclear inspectors for one time. Do you think this changes -- this new word changes the conversation at all? BENNETT: I think Iran's way of going -- their modus operandi is to maneuver. So they invite you in. They show you five percent of it, slow you down. And they just want to buy time while they're racing to acquire the bomb. They also know that they're transferring their facilities underground so it's in a relatively short time frame they'll be immune from an attack. So that's the race; the race to become immune. O'BRIEN: Senator John McCain talked about sort of red lines. I want to play for you what he told me yesterday and then we'll talk about where those red lines are in your mind after this.

SPENCER: Well, they are, because these drinks they keep increasing the concentration of caffeine, but they also have other additives that in a way potentiate the effects of caffeine. So the concern is that with coffee, coffee is large volume and it's hot and you have to ingest it slowly, where a lot of times these drinks are consumed very rapidly. And also, before competing, where a lot of times, you don't drink coffee and then compete, but you may run around on a soccer field, after an energy drink. TAPPER: Lastly, you come from New York, the state of Mayor Bloomberg. How would you respond to those who say this isn't your job as a doctor, it's not your job as a legislator, this is the parents' job? SPENCER: Absolutely. I think that's my point exactly. My concern is with a deceptive message, when you say energy -- it's not energy, it's a stimulant. When parents are confusing these drinks with sports drinks, and when the companies are marketing directly to children with free samples, they're shifting away the parents' focus, taking away the opportunity to parent. And when I see a deceptive practice on an unlevel playing field, I feel as a public elected official, I have a responsibility to get involve. TAPPER: All right. Dr. Spencer, thanks so much for being here. SPENCER: Thank you. Thanks for the opportunity. TAPPER: We should mention we invited representatives from the three leading energy drinks companies to appear on THE LEAD. But they declined. And they did not release a comment.

This fake intel claimed that then Attorney General Loretta Lynch had been compromised in the Clinton e-mail investigation. CNN's Dana Bash has more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: It was because of these concerns that Comey decided to publicly declare that the Clinton probe was over last summer without consulting then Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Now, you may remember that earlier this week, ""The Washington Post"" reported on this intelligence and the doubts about its credibility. But the fact that Comey felt that he had to act based on Russian disinformation is a stark example of how Russia interference really did impact the decision making at the highest levels of the U.S. government during the 2016 campaign. (END VIDEO CLIP) GORANI: Well, Dana Bash there. Although, he is across the pond, the American President has a lot on his plate when he gets back to White House. Host of CNN's ""SMERCONISH,"" Michael Smerconish, joins me now from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I want to ask first about this fake intel that James Comey felt he needed to act on. How does that change things? I mean the fact that, now, it really appears as though even fake intel that the Director of the FBI at the time knew was fake somehow had an impact on the race because of his decision to act. MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST: Hala, this is a really complicated part of the story. I'll do my best. Jim Comey, when he decided he was not going to charge Hillary Clinton, stood up in a press conference scenario and was very critical of her. You might remember when he used the words ""extremely careless"" to describe her e-mail server. In the United States, it's highly unusual that a prosecutor would say anything when determining not to proceed with an indictment. If someone's proceeding with an indictment and making charges against an individual, then, sure, they lay out exactly why they're doing so. And so people have long wondered, why did Jim Comey speak so expansively, so negatively about Secretary Clinton when he made that announcement? And you've just answered the question in part. He did it because of this fake Russian intel as well as the Loretta Lynch meeting that took place in Phoenix with Bill Clinton. And he was worried, apparently, about the perception that if this information were released, even if it were fake, it would create the impression that the FBI did not arrest Hillary Clinton because they were taking a dive for her. They were protecting her. And that's how it motivated him to do what he did. GORANI: All right. You did a great job of explaining it. (LAUGHTER) GORANI: I guess the question is that -- I mean, yes.

He's surrounded by two of the top members of his legal team, by two of his top press secretaries and I think you can bet that there's going to be quite a bit of strategizing happening over this weekend. And particularly as the members of Congress are being briefed by the Department of Justice, that's going to be a critical point. I think the White House is expecting leaks as that process continues and I think they'll be expecting also to combat those leaks with their own narrative as this goes along, Erin.

One example: their inflation rate is now lower than ours for the first time in history. Could a surge in Mexico`s economy be our answer to illegal immigration, and doesn`t this give you a headache? We have the stories in tonight`s ""Real Story."" Now, one of the things I`m really sick of, I`m sick and tired of hearing people say that they`re against the war but they support the troops. I don`t even know what that means. It`s not really an opinion. It`s a bumper sticker, and I`m sick and tired of it. I know the charisma of Barack Obama has pushed the war in Iraq right off the front page. But the reality is American men and women are still fighting, and they are still dying in Iraq and Afghanistan every single day. I have two family members currently serving. Chances are you have family members that are serving or you know somebody who`s over there, as well. That`s why my disgust is beyond -- I mean, just -- it`s spit right out of my mouth for Berkeley, California, and their city council. They told Marine recruiters that they weren`t -- weren`t invited or welcome in Berkeley. Good. Then defend yourself, Berkeley. I don`t get it. ""We`re for peace, love and diversity and understanding."" And yet, you don`t want the people who have given you that right. They`ve know eased their stance a bit and finally recognized the Marines` right to be in Berkeley. But the city council restated their opposition to the war: recognize the Marines but support the troops and militant zombies like Code Pink. I hate Berkeley, California. But that`s just a diverse opinion, isn`t it, Berkeley? First Lieutenant Peter Hugseth is executive director of Vets for Freedom. You know what? They didn`t just say -- while they said they supported the troops, you know this. They also said that they were unwelcomed intruders in Berkeley, California. How do you connect these two thoughts? PETER HEGSETH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, VETS FOR FREEDOM: You can`t connect these two thoughts. You know what? They wouldn`t even apologize for what they said. They said --",0.0903444752590862,2008-02-15

I'm Isha Sesay. The headlines this hour -- (HEADLINES) SESAY: The Trump White House is just hours away from making a historic decision that could dramatically affect the future of them planet. At issue is the Paris Climate Accord and whether the U.S. will honor the landmark agreement or not. A short time ago, President Trump tweeted he would announce his decision on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. eastern. CNN's Sara Murray has the very latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Very soon. SARA MURRAY, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The president is expected to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement, sources tell CNN, as Trump teases a formal announcement coming soon. TRUMP: I'm hearing from a lot of people, both ways. MURRAY: the monumental move would fulfill one of Trump's core campaign promises. TRUMP: We're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement, and stop -- (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Unbelievable. And stop all payments of the United States tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs. MURRAY: But it would also isolate America from nearly every other nation on the globe, after 195 nations pledged in 2015 to take action to curve global warming. Every nation signed on but war-torn Syria and Nicaragua, which insists the deal isn't tough enough. The precise mechanism for withdrawal and how far the U.S. will go are still being determined. And White House officials cautioned the plan could change before Trump announces publicly. The expected decision drew swift backlash from Democrats. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi slammed the move, saying, ""President Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord is a stunning abdication of American leadership and a grave threat to our planet's future.""

In addition to the wind and the rain -- the storm surge, this is going to be a rainfall threat over the next few days. WHITFIELD: And, Reynolds, I know you have a few questions. WOLF: Oh, absolutely. Mr. Mayfield, less than 17 hours ago, we saw this as a -- a very weak depression, with winds around 35 miles an hour. And seeing it jump, just double in power, does that surprise you? Any surprises at all? MAYFIELD: Well, I'm getting, Reynolds, where I'm -- almost expect a surprise every day here. (LAUGHTER) MAYFIELD: You know, when it came into South Florida, we were forecasting it to strengthen to a strong storm, and it just never did do that. It was really a non-event down here. And we were forecasting this to be a storm. We have been forecasting it to strengthen. And now this is right below hurricane strength now. Fortunately, in the -- the briefings we have been giving to emergency management and to FEMA, we have been telling them to prepare for a Category 1 hurricane. WOLF: Mr. Mayfield, do you have any concerns about the precautions that people may be taking, or, rather, the -- the false sense of complacency they may fall into, knowing that this is a tropical storm? (CROSSTALK) WOLF: I mean, when you don't have the banner of ""hurricane"" in front of it, do you think people have a tendency just to kind of relax and not take it as seriously? MAYFIELD: Reynolds, that's a really good point. And, you know, there's no really much difference between 70 miles per hour, and a strong storm, and 74 miles per hour, and a hurricane. That's a -- a little academic, actually. They will likely have three to five feet of storm surge near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast, and some tornadoes, and -- and a lot of rain here. I think that, you know, people -- if people are just careful here, there's no reason to have loss of life. I -- I think the greatest concern is going to be over the next few days, with the rainfall accumulations. And we have done a study here. At least up until Katrina, most people have lost their lives in the United States from the inland flooding. WOLF: Now, with regards to the inland flooding, the -- the latest path we have from the National Hurricane Center shows this storm -- or, rather, what's going to be left of it, as we get into the weekend, into Friday, into Saturday, as becoming a depression.

I just lost my Medicaid, and my mom has to work double hard to pay for the things I need, while Matthew lays around in the hospital playing games. I was really mad that Matthew didn't get a harder sentence and that he went to an easy prison. But I got much more upset when I found out that the pictures of me that he put on the Internet. I had no idea he had done that. Usually, when a kid is hurt the abuser goes to prison and abuse is over, but because Matthew put my pictures on the Internet, the abuse is still going on. Anyone can see them. People are still downloading them, reading notices from the FBI every time someone is arrested for it. I want every single one of them to go to jail and really be punished.

By the same token, it takes away the attention of the American people that their insurance is being taken away without the ability to know what's going to replace it. It does tremendous damage in terms of our environment for generations to come, so it takes away attention from that. The freeze, hiring freeze at a time that we need our veterans to get better processing at the V.A., that won't happen. And then, ultimately, what this really is all about is voter suppression. Because what you do is you make false claims about illegal votes taking place, and then you pass laws that crack down and make it even more difficult to vote to stop the false claims about illicit votes. And, therefore, you go after groups by virtue of making it more difficult, like African-Americans and Hispanics and seniors, which I guess the president doesn't believe ultimately voted for him. And now you have suppression under the guise of greater voter integrity. And that's what I really think this was all about; and it's a very cynical process.

What are the burning questions -- or some of them -- that you plan to write about? ATWOOD: Well, it all comes out of the same hat; namely, mine. (LAUGHTER) So a number of these questions have been with me for a long time. And some of the burning questions are still burning. And they have been burning for years and years and years. So I started seven years ago writing about the penalties for us if we continue to clear-cut the Earth. We will actually, especially if we destroy the oceans, we will stop breathing in any meaningful way. So I'm writing about those things and also writing about, quote, ""the woman question."" (LAUGHTER) (INAUDIBLE) is asking this -- never mind. (LAUGHTER) Yes. So I do some of that. But some other things as well. In fact, quite a few other things, because the inside of my head, out of which all this comes, is sort of like your grandmother's attic. (LAUGHTER) A lot of junk up there. But when you need something, you can go up there and rummage around and you'll probably find it. AMANPOUR: What did you think, just as an aside, of the TV adaptation of ""The Handmaid's Tale?"" And the very fact that it landed I think around the time Donald Trump was inaugurated? ATWOOD: Well, I know and I didn't do it. It's not my fault. So it launched in April and he was inaugurated in January. So let us hypothetically suppose that, instead, Hillary Clinton had won the election -- which she did win the popular vote. So if that had happened, people would have viewed the TV show as, well, we dodged that bullet. And we can now view this in a relaxed kind of way as what is not going to happen. But in fact, that Hillary did not get elected and everybody was in this state of extreme gloom and anxiety, especially young people, who were not old enough to remember dictatorships I have known. So they were going around wringing their hands and saying this is the worst thing that's ever happened. It actually wasn't. But it was pretty startling. And the result, the culmination, which was the January 6th attack on Congress, was, as you say in England, over the top. AMANPOUR: Over the top indeed. So finally, I wish we had a much longer time to talk but what makes Margaret Atwood happy? Because the stories that you tell are distinctly, in my personal opinion, unhappy and worrisome. And I just wonder what makes you happy? ATWOOD: What makes me happy? Well, I don't think there is a cause and effect. I think, some days, you're happy and you feel good and other days you don't.

So, he is talking about an issue that we're very cognizant of, and we need to continue to determine the right way to combat it. BLITZER: Because he is suggesting that the -- Edward Snowden is responsible for causing this gap. Do you agree with that? PSAKI: I certainly wouldn't disagree with a well-known and well- respected leader from the NSA. I think there's no question that the information that was put out there by Edward Snowden, the fact that people saw that information could be out there, has raised this issue. But we're dealing with cyber-security threats from a range of sources. And that's something that we grapple with every single day. BLITZER: There was some heart-wrenching sound we heard from the parents of Kayla Mueller, the American humanitarian aid worker who went into Syria, taken by ISIS, and obviously is now dead. The parents, the relatives, they are very upset that you, the U.S. government, would not allow some sort of ransom to be paid in exchange for her freedom, even though you did allow a swap for Bowe Bergdahl, Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, releasing five Taliban from Guantanamo Bay. You were willing to negotiate on that to get his freedom, but you weren't willing to negotiate to get her freedom. PSAKI: Well, I think one thing to be very clear about is, we take a number of steps to bring American citizens, including Kayla Mueller, home. And I think nobody can understand the pain her family is going through aside from them. So, that's something that we respect and our hearts go out to them. but the fact is that ransom payments we have seen, that they put more American citizens at risk, they make them a higher-value target. There's a reason we have that policy. It's painful. It's something that people don't always understand. But the policy is in place for a reason. And the president said, I think a week or two ago, that this is one of the most difficult issues that he has to communicate with families about. BLITZER: Did the release of those five Taliban prisoners from Gitmo encourage ISIS, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, these other terror groups to go ahead and take other Americans, military or civilian, for that matter, knowing they would get something in return? PSAKI: Look, Wolf, I think there's nothing more I can outline for you in terms of what their motivations were. Some of those issues are speculation. And I just don't have anything more for you on it. I do think that if you look at ransom payments and what we have seen historically around the world, this is a risk there's a lot of evidence on.

200977,351400,CNN,CNN Live Sunday,"JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN ANCHOR: As we have been reporting, Saddam Hussein captured yesterday in a lightning raid near his hometown of Tikrit in Iraq. With us now from ""The Washington Post,"" reporter Vernon Loeb, who was with the soldiers of the 4th Infantry Division 1st Brigade, just a matter of weeks ago. These were the soldiers who took part in that raid yesterday. Vernon Loeb, you have talked to some of those soldiers today, what they have told you? VERNON LOEB, WASHINGTON POST WRITER: I actually haven't talked to them today. They have been pretty busy today in Iraq. But basically the way they took down Saddam is what they have been doing all fall. Day after day after day, they would stage these raids. This is the break they were hoping for. They felt they had missed him many times throughout the fall. On numerous other raids they -- they'd found food, they'd found clothing they they believed belonged to Saddam. So as I said, this is the break they were really waiting for. WOODRUFF: Why was this so hard to do? This is someone very powerful, very high profile, at least he was powerful, why was it so hard to find him? LOEB: Well, as we saw from today's raid, this guy was an expert at hiding. I mean, he spent even the years he was in power hiding. And it's almost a miracle that they found this little spider hole, as they called it today in this farm. Again, this was a guy who had a lot of protectors, he had a lot of money. I mean, he had $750,000 in cash with him today. And he was -- he was very good at hiding. And you know, probably they had come very close before without even knowing it. WOODRUFF: Any sense of why this had a different outcome than the raid that -- that took the lives of his two sons, Uday and Qusay, Saddam Hussein himself coming out alive, his sons obviously went out -- and died. LOEB: Well, his sons resisted, and I think if Saddam, who apparently had a pistol with him, if he had resisted, I think he would have met the same fate. The American soldiers basically are, you know, they would rather take people alive, but as soon as they start taking fire, they fire back and they fire back with extreme, overwhelming force. So I have no doubt had he fired today, I don't think Saddam would have made it out alive. WOODRUFF: All right, Vernon Loeb, having spent some time with the soldiers of the Army's 4th Infantry Division, 1st Brigade, many of those troops took part in the raid yesterday near Tikrit that captured Saddam Hussein.

We'll show you the latest pictures we have coming in. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLACKWELL: Breaking news now. Devastation in Indonesia after a powerful earthquake hit and then triggered a tsunami. Watch this. Wow, you see here when the tsunami strikes the coast and just sweeps through a neighborhood. At last count, 384 people have been killed. PAUL: Now rescuers are desperately searching for survivors there. CNN's Matt Rivers is following the story. Matt, what are you learning this hour? MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We know for sure that that the death toll is going to go up. This is very much an ongoing story. At this point as you mentioned, 384 is the number now. Over 500 people injured, but there are still many more missing and unaccounted for and so we do expect the death toll to go up. This earthquake happened Friday evening in Indonesia and then the tsunami happened shortly thereafter. Rescuers of course went to work. You saw in the video there guys, how powerful the water is. Just think, that's just one section of this part of Indonesia. That's just one video. That kind of scene repeated all along the coast. So rescuers certainly have their work cut out for them moving forward. The city of Dongala is near Palu where the tsunami happened. That city right now is not in communication with rescuers. There's 300,000 people in that city and we don't know the extent of the damage there so that gives you an idea of how much worse this might get. BLACKWELL: Matt, what do you know about Palu? What can you tell us about that part of Indonesia? RIVERS: Yes, it's an eastern part of Indonesia; it's a poor area. There's no other way to put it. The infrastructure there does not stand up well to natural disasters like this. So start with the fact that you had an earthquake but then you top that with the tsunami. A lot of the houses, the structures that are along the coastline there are nothing more than wooden shacks so they stand no chance against an earthquake or tsunami and certainly not against both. That's what rescuers have working against them, trying to find people buried, roads are closed. The airport has a crack in the runway. This situation is probably only going to get worse guys.

And I'll talk about this from our point of view, because obviously, we have the Free Syrian Army in the south. And we're working with the Russians of creating a ceasefire with our forces in the south. And I specifically have discussed with Putin you can't expect young men and women to put their arms down and abide by a ceasefire if there's no movement on the political process in Vienna. They're not going to sit there and do this for two or three months and not expect something to happen. So the Russians are fully aware that, sooner rather than later, we have to have a mechanism that allows the process to move forward.

He has got the architects to vote-lead, Matthew Elliott running his campaign. He is somebody I think who will unite the country. He is of Heineken candidate. He can reach parts of the country -- that's an old beer advert for your viewers. He can reach parts of the country that other candidates can't reach. I'm talking about the whole of the United Kingdom, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. SOARES: Theresa May talks about, she quote, ""Compromise is not a dirty word,"" today, she said. Do you think that be it Sajid Javit or anyone else within the Conservative Party or Dominic Raab or Boris Johnson? Do you think they will compromise? HALFON: Well, it is interesting. The Prime Minister quoted Nicholas Winton and on my wall, I have another quote from Nicholas Winton, one of the greatest men of our country, and he said, ""If it's not impossible, there must be a way to do it."" And I genuinely believe that it is possible to renegotiate a new mandate, and whoever is leader, whether it is Sajid, my preferred candidate or someone else, they will be able to go to Brussels and renegotiate. SOARES: How is Sajid Javid -- how would he differentiate himself from the other candidates do you think? What will he be saying differently to try and get the vote of the Conservative Party? HALFON: Well, I think Sajid will set out a Brexit that delivers the referendum result, but also unifies the Conservative Party. He will probably say more about that when he formally announces to start. But I also believe and is the main reason why I'm backing him is that he is a social justice conservative, he will put social justice first and foremost at the heart of the Conservative Party mission, carrying on what the Prime Minister said on the steps of Downing Street addressing burning injustices in our country. He will look after the people who are struggling. The reason for that is because he knows what it's like to struggle. His family knows what it's like struggle and he grew up depending on public services. SOARES: What he'll have to do first is try, like you said, he will try to unite the party and then deal with Europe, because that is the crucial first because the party is still divided, so is the Houses of Parliament.

But is this what is best for the child known as Zachary. We are discussing this with our human behavior expert after the break. But first, in order for Americans to compete better globally, and students to gain a rich learning experience, experts say they will simply have to stay in school longer during the year. But as education contributor Steve Perry explains the challenge comes down to spending the money. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEVE PERRY, CNN EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT: The rest of the world is going to school longer than most the American children. One of the reasons why is because we made it too expensive to spend the children to school year round. It's not more expensive to run the buildings because the buildings run no matter whether we are in them or not. It's because of labor cost, the administrators and most of all, the teachers. They get paid more if they work a longer year. And to pay them more would mean we would not be able to run a longer school year. We need our teachers to understand that our schools need to go longer not just longer for longer sake but longer to give children to have a deeper dive in academics experiences. We can do better as a country and we know what it takes to run a good school system. The question becomes, when will we decide we are going to run those schools in this country?

Is there a chance of getting into first class because most of those seats are -- 95 percent are taken up by the frequent flyers who are being rewarded, aren't they? WIDZER: One of the things I talk about is try to travel when business travelers are not traveling because they are going to be your biggest competition for upgrades. So what you want to do is you want to travel, say, on a late Monday, a Tuesday, Wednesday, early Thursday, or even a Saturday. And something I'm doing next week, I have an early morning interview. And instead of leaving on Sunday where I have to pay over $1,100 for a coach ticket I'm actually leaving Saturday night and I'll leave at 11:00 p.m. I'll arrive into the city early Sunday morning. I have already arranged with the hotel for them to have me do an early check in. So by doing that I'm saving over $450 and I already have a first class upgrade. Plus, I get to enjoy the city for the whole day. GRIFFIN: Now let's talk about destinations where we're heading. One of your tips is to not go where everybody goes or go when they are not there. WIDZER: Yes. Exactly. I like to avoid crowds. And I think I get the best upgrades by doing that. So what I like to advise travelers is to look for destinations where they are going to really want your business. And that doesn't mean going to Phoenix, say in the middle of July just to get a good room rate. What it does mean is look to places where your",0.9181100217864924,2004-07-05

But, last night, his Clippers are falling to Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks, 129-124. Giannis, 38 points and 16 rebounds in this game. It was a funny moment in this one. Fourth quarter, watch Eric Bledsoe. He thought this was a pickup game. He gets the ball from the ref and tries to dribble it in bounds. One of the funnier turnovers you see this season. All right. Elsewhere in the NBA, the rockets taking on the Warriors. Now, this over the past five years, is one of the, if not the number one match-up, in the NBA, but certainly not anymore. The Warriors without all of their stars. Rockets won easily, 129-112. And after the game, James Harden forgetting who the stars on the Warriors actually are these days.

The son, Cole, projected to be a top five pick in the NBA draft. North Carolina won that game, 76-65. Finally, we don't show you a soccer game in Serbia very often. But this was too good.

And I think that his problems are political, and they're the problems everybody else has.

This is a tornado wipes (ph) that is in effect for the next couple of hours. That is for portions of Oklahoma, Southeast Oklahoma, Arkansas, and portions of Louisiana and Texas as well. In total, we have seen 10 tornado reports and 29 severe winter reports. The of those winter reports show that we had gusts almost a hurricane-force in portions of Oklahoma and we've also seen some large hail, too. The system is moving to the northeast. We have it at level 2 out of a 5 risk for portions of the Midwest and the great lakes on Monday. Large hail and damaging wind are the main threats here. But it is not over for the Central U.S. Here in the plains, we are looking at a level 3 out of a 5 risk for Tuesday. Large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes are the threat with this setup. And the reason why we are seeing this setup coming our way on Tuesday is because of what is developing out west. We have our first winter-like storm system developing over the Intermountain West and it's going to drop a lot in the west snowfall on Tuesday and Wednesday. When you this clash in air masses, that cold Canadian air coming down from the north and then you got the warm, humid air rising up from the south, well, that clash causes severe weather. And geographically here in the U.S., we are set up for this clash to occur twice a year. The first time is the primary tornado season, which runs from March to June, AKA spring.

And he's the author of the book, ""The Death of Politics: How to Heal Our Frayed Republic After Trump"". Margaret Carlson, first to you on this intensifying hate movement. You know, we do see at Trump rallies pre-pandemic, reporters getting heckled. But it seems qualitatively different to me to see a local TV reporter get pursued the way he was on Long Island. Did it strike you as well? MARGARET CARLSON, COLUMNIST, THE DAILY BEAST: It did. And, you know, the president sees everything in partisan terms, not just his re- election but the virus. And so when this happens, it's getting attention, he is all over it. Even more so than, by the way, the people who were sponsoring the protest disavowed this activity while the president was still cheering it on. The idea that the president has anything other than a media strategy to deal with the coronavirus is misguided. The entire strategy -- there's no national plan. It's only to be on TV. The task force, in fact, was dreamt up by Trump, I think, in order to hold briefings. It was a vehicle for the briefings. Then when the briefings went south for obvious reasons, the disinfectant gambit, he still kept having the briefings by simply conjuring up an event like having a few CEOs to the White House, having a few governors to the White House. So he kept -- he gets to keep doing that. So a demonstration is no different from any other media availability. There it is. He takes advantage of it. And that these weren't armed protesters -- by the way, he has called them good. Even though they're threatening -- they're standing in Lansing, Michigan, in front of the state capitol armed to the teeth threatening the governor to the point where she's had to retreat back into her office with more guards.

They were very brief; I guess I was a little surprised by that. CANDY CROWLEY, HOST, CNN'S ""STATE OF THE UNION"": Well, listen, no good can come of talking for a lengthy time on something for which there are no words. And the Republicans right now, they've pulled the agenda for next week on the house floor. There will be no action on anything controversial. This is just not the time to be out there making speeches. The longer you're out there, the more it turns political and what all of these politicians, Republicans and Democrats, most of these politicians, Republicans and Democrats are trying to do right now is to stay out of the political. I mean, we have people who have been killed. We have people who are in critical condition, and those in serious condition, so it's not really a time you want to be out there for too long. COSTELLO: It's sort of the elephant in the room, though, isn't it? I mean, there isn't any concrete evidence that this shooter acted in the way he did because of political reasons but it is the elephant in the room and it is the first thing that comes to mind in many people's minds. CROWLEY: Well, there is absolutely no percentage in the Speaker of the House getting into a discussion about who or what caused this to happen. It -- it -- it looks as though a gunman who was not in his right mind -- certainly you have to not be in your right mind to try to take out at least 18 people -- so there -- there was no political percentage and there is nothing a politician can gain by being out there talking about what the motivation was when the police haven't even done it. And there's -- there's nothing -- look, there's going to be -- there's already conversations all over the blogs, you know it, I know it.",0.0388245281134525,2011-01-09

It appears that Germany's left-leaning Social Democratic Party has narrowly defeated the party of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel in the country's federal election. Preliminary official results show the left-leaning party winning the most seats in the German Parliament. What is not entirely clear, though, is who will succeed Merkle. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen with the very latest from Berlin. This gets complicated in a hurry, Fred. FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, John and Brianna. Yes, it certainly looks like there's some changes coming here in Germany with a new chancellor, and that chancellor's name could very well be Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats. They got the largest part of the vote. And, Scholz came out earlier this morning and he said that he believes that he has a clear mandate from voters to become Germany's next chancellor and to form a government. Now, things looking really bad for Angela Merkel's party. Their main candidate not managed to get very much of the vote. In fact, record losses for that party. Now, the conservatives, which is Angela Merkel's faction -- they still believe they might be able to form a government, but it really looks like it's going to be tough for them. And, of course, Angela Merkel leaving the political stage here after 16 years, and this was certainly not the way she would have wanted to do it, guys. BERMAN: All right, Fred. Thank you very much.

JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right, right, right. I mean, when you look at what's happening here in the State of New York. I mean, it's much different from what's happening in many other places. I mean, you can't even really compare what's happening here compared to like a Wisconsin or a Michigan, for example. I mean, even when you look at New York, the governor made it clear that he was going to take a regional approach to this. That's why when you look at New York City, which is still under that stay-at-home order, an order that's been extended until the end of the month, until May 28th, and when you compare that to what's happening in upstate, where we are here in Binghamton, you've got five of ten regions in upstate that have met the criteria in order to begin reopening, so that's why today you'll see construction, manufacturing, curbside retail able to go forward and reopen. I mean, the folks that we've talked to up here, Poppy, this is a day that they say is a long time coming. I spoke to a man who works in construction, runs a construction company, I spoke to him in a town that sits not far from here, and he says, this day is long overdue.

(END VIDEO CLIP) CARROLL: So, reopening but trying to do their best to reopen carefully. That's going to be the story here in Binghamton. But, again, you look at New York City. New York City has only met four out of the seven criteria in order to begin reopening. So, again, New York City still on pause, still waiting to economically get back on their feet. Poppy, Jim?

And don't like the idea of kids getting patted down at airport security? Well, you and a lot of people. So, the TSA is rolling out a new program to cut down on child pat-downs at security check points. The plan, kids under 12 get hands swabbed and go through detectors multiple times as alternative screenings. They can also keep their shoes on. This requires training screeners so the new rules will take a few weeks to a few months to be put into place. Still ahead on WAKE-UP CALL, a check on the markets.

There's real concern, Carol, that after three years of debt problems in Europe, that the exposure to some of these French banks is still too significant and that, quite frankly, there's concern about European leadership not being able to solve this quite yet.

Should members of Congress be out in a public setting like that? It's a crazy question to ask. Anybody should be able to go and practice baseball, but - DESANTIS: But here's the thing. I mean today Paul Ryan told Steve this morning, I need you. We've got a - we've got a meeting at 7:00. I've got something. There would have been no security out there. I mean the only reason there was security is because Steve rates it as a member of the leadership. They usually stage behind the first base dugout. They have the SUV. They usually will stand outside the vehicle. You know they're armed and you know they're security. This guy, the shooter, was obviously on the other side of the diamond. But had Steve not been there, I think you would have seen many more injured and probably many killed. I think it would have been a really gruesome day. So having the Capitol Police there really saved lives today. I think there's no question about that. KING: All right, take me back into the parking lot. I want you to describe again just in every last detail that you can recall the gentleman who asked that question. DESANTIS: So I got into the car first. So I'm in the back seat. Jeff Duncan's walking up into the front passenger seat. His aide is driving the car. And as Jeff's getting in, there's an individual that's kind of approaching our general direction. I wasn't sure he was approaching our car. Then did he come to the car and then asked the question, are those Republicans or Democrats out there? Not really a friendly guy, not nice. Jeff said they were Republicans. And then he immediately kind of clicked and he turned around. And again, I didn't think - I thought it was a little weird, but not at the weirdness level where this guy's a security risk. But, he - in the picture, it does - it matches the type of guy. I thought it was probably late 50s, early 60s. I think they reported he's 66. So that probably fits pretty good. BLITZER: What did he look like? DESANTIS: He - you know, he was like, you know, late 50s, early 60s. I mean he had kind of like darker hair with maybe some gray in it. I think he had some facial hair, as well. And he just - he was dressed kind of - not nicely dressed at all, but not like he was wearing rags. Just the kind of - the type of guy that if you were talking down the street there with 30 other people, you probably wouldn't pick him out and think anything of him. KING: And that's all he said?

KENNY HARMS, ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL TOUR CADDIES: Well you know the - what is happening is that they're putting this bib over the top of us.

A large, long list of items. He got to Social Security, Iraq, Iran, energy, Paul Wolfowitz being recommended to head the World Bank, steroids, just to name a few, as well as a same-sex marriage issue. Let's go to our Suzanne Malveaux at the White House, who has been listening in with us, just one of the many correspondents we'll be checking in with around the world about the president's news conference -- Suzanne. SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Daryn, there are two things that really stood out that highlight this press conference. One, of course, the centerpiece of his domestic agenda. The president has been having a very difficult time convincing Democrats and also his own party to push forward, to buy into this idea of private accounts. President Bush very dismissive of any suggestion that he has failed in convincing the American people that that would be a successful route, saying that he didn't even come up with the plan, that certainly this alone would not work. Even made light of a possible timetable, saying as soon as we get it done, no matter whatever that means. The president, of course, somewhat defensive in that. Because to take look at the polls, dismiss the polls as well, but all the polls that we have seen show that the American people just simply don't buy this plan. A lot of frustration from Democrats who want the president to come up with a plan of his own and Republicans, specifically, who feel they're under a lot of pressure from their own home constituency about taking on an issue that is so contentious. And as you know, of course, Daryn, this comes at a time when Congress is going to be in recess. They're going to go back to their voters and again be faced with this very tough question. Now, when it come to the foreign agenda, of course President Bush again focusing on Iraq. Now, the latest poll from an ABC-""Washington Post"" poll shows that most people, again, do not buy into his larger vision here, that it's worth it to shed American blood for the sake of spreading democracy. That is why President Bush, of course, talking about democracy on the march in the Middle East, and particularly the success inside of Iraq, saying it was a bright moment, the fact that you see the National Assembly in Iraq gather today. The fact that it was prime minister -- Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, who he had a conversation with this morning who assured him that, look, they're pulling out their troops, but at the same time, they're going to make sure that they first talk about the coalition, the Iraqi -- the training of Iraqi troops, that this is not a change in policy.

(APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN HOST: The president has called for raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour. He also supports a bill in Congress to raise it to $10.10. But fast foods workers say $15 an hour the living wage they need. The question, a living wage, who pays? Could raising the minimum wage ultimately hurt the very workers it's meant to help? It's all in the eye of the beholder. First, look through the low wage workers eyes for a moment. The minimum wage hasn't risen since 2009. It's $7.25 today. That's, you know, about $15,000 a year if you look at the federal level. Workers say simply not enough to live on. But look at it now through the eyes of the fast food CEO. If wages go up they will have to pass on the increased cost to consumers. Good- bye $1 menu, hello $1.25 menu. But the worker sees the big CEO salaries. Burger Ling's CEO $6.5 million. Yum brand CEO, that's Taco Cell, KFC, Pizza Hut, $11 million, McDonald's CEO, almost $14 million. But the CEO maybe, the business view is a little bit different. Automation - if workers get too expensive they can be replaced by machines. McDonald's uses order touch screens in Europe. Applebee's is putting a tablet at every single table. Now, back to the worker. The worker says they deserve a living wage. This isn't just teenagers flipping burgers. The average age of a fast food worker is 29 years old. More than quarter of fast food workers are parents raising kids. But the other view, these jobs were never intended to raise a family on. The minimum wage is for unskilled entry level workers. There are bigger economic forces at play here. It's not the fault of the industry. Bottom line, the minimum wage, a loaded issue, an issue loaded with emotion and different points of view. Here's how one Wendy's worker put it.

Only one out of ten teens actually sleeps that much according to a new study in ""The Journal of Pediatrics."" The rest are sleep deprived and the result, a decreased ability to think and concentrate, not to mention a heightened risk of obesity, depression, even a higher risk of being in a car accident.

He is founder of Ron Clark Academy. It's a prominent middle school that also serves as an educational training facility for tens of thousands of teachers from across the country. Pleasure for being on the program. RON CLARK, RON CLARK ACADEMY: Thanks so much for having me. I appreciate it. GUPTA: So, you've heard this report. We'll talk about that in a second. But let me ask about the academy. What time do the kids start there? CLARK: They start at 8:00 and some arrive as early as 7:15. GUPTA: How is that first part of the day for them? How do they perform, how do they do? CLARK: We love it actually. I'm not a morning person. The kids in the 8:00 classes tend to focus better and test scores are better. And teachers want the classes at 8:00 a.m., because kids tend to retain more information earlier in the morning. GUPTA: What drives the decision, though, in terms of when to start? I'm sure part of it is obviously trying to gauge how the students are going to do, but there's a lot of other factors that weigh in? CLARK: It's society. It's the parents, because they need to get to work they need to drop the kid off at 7:15 so they can get to work on time. It's to accommodate the society we live in. GUPTA: So, the parents are getting to work. Also, I know school buses, for example, will recycle from one group of students to the next group of students so you have to start them at staggered times as well. Things like that make a difference. When you hear this sort of study, you saw the piece there, what do you make of it? You've been at this for a long time. Does it play a role for you in terms of how you would start school? When you would start it?

Our chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour reports on the horrifying genocide in Rwanda and how it all began. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): General Romeo Delaire (ph), the head of UN forces in Rwanda knew that trouble was coming. For months, the UN commander in Rwanda had warned his bosses in New York that Hutu extremists were arming and training militias. Then on April 6, 1994, the plane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi was shot down, a double assassination. This was the moment the Hutu plotters had been waiting for. The death of the president was the start point, the signal? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:",0.203996983408748,2008-12-03
1067890,1363985,CNN,Fareed Zakaria Gps,"FAREED ZAKARIA, HOST: This is GPS, the Global Public Square. Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world. I'm Fareed Zakaria. We've got a great show for you today. We'll start with Mitt Romney's plans for the American economy. I have an exclusive interview with his senior economic advisor, Glenn Hubbard. Then, Syria, what's next after that massacre of civilians almost 50 children killed? I will ask Fawaz Gerges, the noted expert. Next up, the Harvard Business School's Michael Porter, he is the most cited author on business and economics in the world. He has a new study to talk about. First, here's my take. Kofi Annan's mission in Syria, which appears to hope that Syria's President Assad will negotiate his own departure, seems utterly doomed. Instead, America and the Western world, indeed the civilized world, should attempt to dislodge the Assad regime. But is there a smart way to do it? For a number of reasons, military intervention is unlikely to work in Syria. Unlike in, say Libya, Syria is not a vast country with huge tracts of land where rebels can retreat, hide and be resupplied. Syria is roughly one-tenth the size of Libya, but with three times as many people. Perhaps for this reason, the Syrian rebels have not been able to take control of any significant part of that country. The geopolitics of military intervention are also unattractive. In Egypt and even in Libya, all the major regional powers, world powers, were on the side of dislodging the regime or at least passively accepting that it would happen. In Syria, that is not the case. Iran and Russia have both maintained strong ties to the Assad regime. So were the Western powers to intervene, it would quickly become a proxy struggle, with great power-funded militias on both sides. That would likely result in a long, protracted civil war with civilian casualties that would dwarf the current numbers. Think of the Lebanese civil war of the 1980s that lasted a decade, killed over 150,000 people and displaced over a million. The Syrian regime has stayed intact. There have been no major defections from the army, intelligence services or business community. Why? Well the regime is Alawite, a Shiite sect that represents about 10 percent of Syrians, and the key military and intelligence posts belong to Alawites. These loyalists stick with the regime because they know that in a post-Assad Syria, they would likely be massacred. But Assad has also been able to stop defections among the Sunni and Christian members of the ruling elite, presumably with a mix of threats and bribes. Now, that's where the regime might be vulnerable. Syria is not an oil state. The regime does not have unlimited resources with which to buy off elites. So were truly crippling sanctions to be put in place, including an embargo on energy, it is likely that the regime would begin to crack. That might mean a brokered exit for the",0.099522000245128,2012-06-03

China SAYS is investigating the director of the country's work safety agency following last week's deadly chemical exPLOsion in Tianjin. CHURCH: Authorities are working to clean up the toxins left behind. Will Ripley reports on the challenges they face. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right now, several thousand people are on the ground working to clean up the chemical disaster unfolding here. You can see the crews behind me. They had to throw out the hazmat suits they were wearing and they changed into these new yellow suits because they were contaminated with sodium cyanide. They have detected and collected that deadly toxin and other deadly chemicals in this area. We are a half a mile from the blast site and the chemicals that they found, they have deposited in this truck. You can see they have the storage containers to secure it safely and ship it to an area where it can be contained and away from the public. Keep in mind, we are standing just across the street from thousands of apartments where people are supposed to be moving in, in less than two months. A state reporter, who tagged along with the crews and travelled to the center of the blast site, which is heavily restricted, so there's no access to the general public. This reporter was embedded with the crews. As they got closer to the center of the blast site, the levels of sodium cyanide and neurotoxins exceed the measuring capacity of their testing meters. That shows you just how heavily concentrated these chemicals are. And it's made worse on the ground by the fact it has been raining today. While the rain clears the pollution in the air it makes things more complicated on the ground. The water can interact with the chemicals that these folks here, these hazmat workers here are working to detect. The cleanup effort continues and so does the process of identifying the bodies. The death toll is holding steady and more and more families are getting confirmation that their loved ones were killed in this disaster a week ago but it's there is a search underway for the missing. And there are dozens missing a full week after this exPLOsion and the ensuring environmental disaster that this city and this country is still coming to terms with. Will Ripley, CNN, Tianjin, China.

And it's not always clear what motivated the driver. WEIL: There are a few different types of people behind the wheel. At one end are the true clear extremist, the card-carrying members of extremist organizations. A step down are those who are yelling slurs and are clearly racially motivated. We also have some non-racially motivated ones with just angry drivers. And then there are true accidents like someone whose GPS brings them into a protests. MCMORRIS-SANTORO (voice-over): But Weil says there are people who like to see cars running protesters down. WEIL: There is an online environment encouraging these incidents. MCMORRIS-SANTORO (voice-over): Memes about using cars as weapons have spread on the right. Remarkably, some even celebrate the killing of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. Some conservative lawmakers have tried to pass laws that protect drivers who claim they're afraid for their lives. Those efforts have failed for the most part, but Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, introduced new legislation this week. The proposal is running into stiff opposition including from some in law enforcement. (on camera): If laws like that are not written carefully, do you think that we could see more of these cars being weaponized in these protests? CEDRIC ALEXANDER, NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY EXPERT: Absolutely you could because with what it will do, it will allow those with nefarious intent. It will give them an escape to be able to use as to why they plowed through a crowd. MCMORRIS-SANTORO (voice-over): Despite the danger, Monterrosa says he is seeing no indication protesters will be pushed off the streets by fear. MONTERROSA: I think this only adds fuel to the fire. I don't think this stops anybody. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCMORRIS-SANTORO (on camera): Now, Ana, the big concern for researchers like Ari at the University of Chicago in that piece is that these new laws like the one that the governor of Florida has proposed has not passed, actually encouraged people to go in the protests and do this. He's done research showing that previous efforts to pass laws, all of which mostly failed, did encourage more people to do this. So, it does seem like it's a part of protests that's here to stay for the moment and the concern is it might become more of a thing if lawmakers try to protect these drivers like they have in the past.

CAMEROTA: Well, there you go, Elie. I mean, all of the poppycock about this was a spontaneous reaction, there were people in combat gear, there were people in battle fatigues. And, by the way, this isn't just the Justice Department, correct me if I'm wrong, saying this. Some of the Oath Keepers have already begun cooperating with some of the investigators. HONIG: Exactly right, Alisyn. Let this put to rest the mythmaking and the revisionist history and the outright denialism around January 6. I mean, it's laid out there in black and white by the Justice Department, with, by the way, quite strong proof to back it up laid out in the indictment, including quoted electronic communications. This indictment, when you read it, it is clear this was an organized effort. This was an effort that was organized not on the spot, but for days and weeks in advance. There were elements of weaponry, of armaments, of tactical movements. And, again, the group that was putting this all together or one of the groups that was putting this all together was the Oath Keepers. We know who they are. That is a domestic extremist group. These are facts. The Justice Department lays them out very clearly in the indictment. And that's why this is such a high-impact charge. BLACKWELL: Yes, for some of those on Capitol Hill who have tried to whitewash what happened that day and talk about what they claim was spontaneous, we're learning from this indictment the allegation that Stewart Rhodes wrote this -- quote -- ""We aren't getting through this without a civil war. Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body, and spirit."" Evan, you talked about how the DOJ was pumping the brakes on a seditious conspiracy charge to make sure they could make the case. PEREZ: Yes. BLACKWELL: Were they holding it specifically for Rhodes and Vallejo and these eight others? Or are you saying that they were holding off on charging anyone on this until they had this level of proof? PEREZ: Yes, I think they -- there were some prosecutors, certainly the former acting U.S. attorney who was running these cases, Mike Sherwin, he thought this was ready to go, at least against some of the defendants that you already knew about, some of the 19 or so members of the Oath Keepers who already are facing charges. He thought this was ready to go. He said so in an interview on ""60 Minutes."" Merrick Garland, who had just taken office, was not so ready. He wanted more work done by prosecutors.

I mean, the fact that the majority of Americans did not vote for Donald Trump.

And, you know, it's an interesting thing.

You can see it on Twitter and in the commentary about this episode.

Have you had any problems concerning your decision to allow military airplanes to fly out of Shannon? BERTIE AHERN, IRISH PRIME MINISTER: No, we have not, Larry. We have taken the decision all the way from September 11 that we were going to support the United States' efforts. We had the presidency of the Security Council for the whole month of October. We have supported under Article 51 of the United Nations the United States' right to self-defense, the United States' right to take action against any country where they believed they had intelligence on, and that it's certainly first up was Afghanistan, and we have supported that right throughout. KING: But you have ruled out direct military involvement, is that correct? AHERN: Ireland is a neutral country, because we are not part of the neutral -- of the military alliance, but we are not neutral on terrorism. We have participated in a United Nations missions all over the world. At the moment, we've been in half a dozen countries. We're in southern Lebanon for the last 25 years, we're in Ethiopia, Eritrea. So, once it's under the umbrella of the United Nations, we are a part of it. KING: Are there concerns for your own country by permitting the use of Shannon that Islamic terrorists might take action against an already terrorist-ripped country, your own? AHERN: Well, no, there's not, Larry. In our view, Ireland has been closely linked to the United States. Millions of our people here moved out after the Irish famine, and they continued to do so in every decade for the last 150 years. Over 40 million people of Irish- American origin in the United States of America, we have no qualms about this. We believe we are used to fighting terrorism.

You've got the Germans and the French talking about cutting off arm supplies and ending arms deals also to the Saudis. So you got a lot of things that are building up that really mean that particularly from the Saudi-led coalition's perspective, there's very little to be gained internationally from continuing the war and quite lot to be gained from persecuting a ceasefire rather than more violence, Cyril.

SMITH: When we actually realized that it was him, you know, we all broke down, you know? CALLEBS: Painful, but officials say this family has a sense of closure. Many others don't.

695741,955842,CNN,American Morning,"you measure their head circumference. And researchers at North Carolina decided to take it a step further, trying to figure out whether specific areas of the brain that were different. This is a fascinating new study. One of the first types of this type of study being done in children with autism. What they found specifically was when you start to peer deep into the brain, you spin that brain around and you look at an area called the amygdala. These are these almond-shaped areas that is sort of in the front of the brain. They are called subcortical areas. What's so important about this particular area of the brain is that it is responsible for one's ability to process emotions, to process faces, to process threat and to put that all together, something known as joint attention behavior. What they found specifically, Kiran, is that children with autism, at least in this study, seemed to have amygdala that were about 13 percent larger than children without autism. Again, the first sort of sign that maybe there is a structural difference at someplace within the brain. Also, interestingly if you sort of follow that study along, you find that at age four, while the amygdala grew fast between 0 and age two, it really didn't seem to change in size up to age four. So again, this is an area of the brain that is responsible for your ability to process things. Like you told the child look at that clock, for example, a normal child would simply look at the clock. A child with autism may not be able to process that and may not be able to not be threatened by that as well. So early study, but an interesting one. Kiran. CHETRY: So what's the take away for parents? I know when kids go for physicals, they measure the circumference of their head at every physical. GUPTA: Yes, you know, I'm not sure that they know for sure yet what to do with this. Although again when we're talking about autism there are so many different factors that seem to come into play here. If there is a structural difference like they seem to point to and figure out when the structural difference changes. So the next step, for example, for researchers is to maybe do these MRI scans early to find out if a child is born with a larger amygdala, or is there some predisposition to it, or does it just happen after a child is born. It's just unclear. I don't know that there is a -- you know, this is going to lead to a therapy yet, but, you know, again, trying to figure out autism, trying to unlock this mystery is I think the goal of a lot of researchers out there.

QUESTION: ... concerned about (inaudible)? TRUMP: No. I'm not concerned. I'm not concerned. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: So you still don't think there's going to be a deal but you're not going to declare it now. Don't you think that's undermining... TRUMP: No, I'm waiting -- excuse me. I didn't say that. I said I'm waiting until February 15th. On February 15th, the committee will come back and if they don't have a wall, I don't even want to waste my time reading what they have because it's a waste of time. Because the only thing that works for security and safety for our country is a wall. Now, when you couple the wall with sensors and drones and all of these other things, that works as a combination. But if you don't have a wall, they're all just wasting their time. It's just politics. Thank you all very much. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Thank you very much, everybody. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR: All right, that was President Trump, just moments ago, following not too long after Democrats unveiling their plan in these negotiations to keep the government open and to talk about border security where they say there is not going to be a wall but they're open to barriers. That's the word from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But you just heard President Trump there saying if they are not coming to this negotiation, talking about a wall, he doesn't even want to waste his time reading what they have. Let's get to Abby Phillip at the White House. Abby, you were in that room. Also we heard the president talking about his insulting the -- one of his intel chiefs, really all of them, but specifically going after the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, and he said, well, time will tell if he's right. But let's -- let's first talk about the discussions or these negotiations that are being set -- the stage being set there, as he put it, with Capitol Hill. ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Interestingly, Brianna, it sounded very much like President Trump was essentially closing the door to negotiations. He said repeatedly he didn't think anything was going to come out of this conference committee that's been meeting with Republicans and Democrats on The Hill. And he said point blank in response to a question I asked him about Nancy Pelosi's comments about the wall, saying that there would be no wall in the deal but perhaps physical barriers, he said, I will not accept that if it doesn't have a wall. So the president's drawing the line really brightly in the sand here and adding that if on February 15th he gets a deal on his desk that does not include the border wall, he's not even going to look at it. He's just going to go to the other option. He made",0.5671629516193069,2019-01-31

998588,1288052,CNN,The Situation Room,"exception of Mitt Romney who ran back in 2008, of course, Ron Paul who is also a candidate in the past and Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. Most Americans are not familiar with the Republican field. So this season of debates is really helped to clarify the election and to give others a sense of who the other candidates are. BLITZER: The debates seem to be more important than ever. But correct me if you disagree. RICH GALEN, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR TO SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH: No, I think you're right. I think it's part of a change, a sea change in politics. Four years ago, the campaigns knew about social media and Twitter, but only the younger voters did, which is one of the reasons why President Obama did so well. Now grand mothers are checking their Facebook page to see what the granddaughter looks like. So this is a completely different era. And people are perfectly comfortable seeing candidates do this on TV as opposed to marching through a hog farm in Iowa. BLITZER: Can Rick Perry come back from that brain freeze gap? BRAZILE: You know, we've seen other candidates implode throughout the electoral season. So I think Rick Perry has money. He has a terrific organization and some of the early stakes. Perhaps if one of the other leading candidates implode, Rick Perry may be able to capitalize on their mistakes. GALEN: Here's what I think. I think he can come back from anything in politics except for ridicule. Once you become the object of ridicule, you're doomed. I think Rick Perry last night passed the ridicule threshold. BLITZER: Can Herman Cain survive these sexual harassment allegations? BRAZILE: He's been defined. He's been able to keep his base with him, raise a lot of money. It's going to hurt him with women. It's going to hurt him in the general election if he becomes the Republican nominee. GALEN: I think at some point the weight of all these things, it's not just the sexual harassment things but abortion thing, the Mexican fence, all of the things that he sort of, you know, said and then said I was just kidding. BRAZILE: And what about China? GALEN: China. Didn't know they were a nuclear power. I mean, he just doesn't know enough to be president. I think that will weigh upon him. I think we're beginning to see now that it's beginning to weigh him down. BLITZER: My sense is, and I'd love both of you to weigh in -- the setback that's Herman Cain has had to endure over the past several days and Rick Perry over the past several weeks, all of a sudden Newt Gingrich, your former boss, all of a sudden he's coming out of nowhere and he's doing amazingly well.

2570344,69780,MSNBC,Countdown,"BREAK)\n \n\n OLBERMANN: Dick Cheney has never depended on the kindness of strangers. Still, even if it is not painful, it must be\ninfuriating to read one week that the president is steamed at you, and then to read the next that the special prosecutor may\nbe cutting through the tall grass towards you, and read that the polls say the country is steamed at you.\n \n\n Our fourth story on the COUNTDOWN, Mr. Cheney in crosshairs of some kind.\n \n\n In a moment, the insights of former White House counsel John Dean.\n \n\n First, Mr. Cheney will always have at least one friend. He today met at the White House for 45 minutes with the controversial\ndeputy prime minister of Iraq, Ahmed Chalabi. Mr. Cheney\'s office will provide no details. Perhaps Mr. Chalabi will send it\nin over the transom later.\n \n\n Some details, though, in the insights of vox populi. According to the latest ""Newsweek"" poll we mentioned earlier, Mr.\nCheney is held in even lower esteem than is the president right now, only 29 percent thinking he is honest and ethical, 55\npercent saying otherwise. Fifty-two percent thinks he, quote, ""deliberately misused or manipulated prewar intelligence,"" end\nquote, about Iraq\'s nuclear capabilities to make a case for war. And the same number think he was part of a cover-up to prevent\na proper investigation of the CIA leak.\n \n\n Which might explain the actions of his former chief of staff, ""The Washington Post"" reporting over the weekend that\nprosecutors had diary notes written by Scooter Libby that detailed activities in the White House, leading up to the outing\nof the CIA operative Valerie Plame, including one bring that he heard Plame\'s name from the vice president, though Mr. Libby\nlater testified that he had forgotten about that revelation.\n \n\n But given Libby\'s own reputation as a lawyer and longtime government official, coupled with the details in his notes,\nsome of his critics posit that he deliberately lied in order to protect his boss, which adds to the speculation that the special\nprosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald\'s ultimate target is in fact the vice president himself.\n \n\n That conclusion has been reached by John Dean, author of ""Worse Than Watergate,"" and our frequent guest here. He joins\nus again to explain why.\n \n\n As always, sir, thank you for your time tonight.\n \n\n JOHN DEAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: Good evening, Keith.\n \n\n OLBERMANN: Let me jump right to the bloodcurdling conclusion you have written about. You can envision a scenario in\nwhich the vice president ends up resigning. Do you want to explain that one?\n \n\n DEAN: I can. When I parsed the indictment itself, the first thing I noticed is, it is not the typical indictment you\nsee out of a federal prosecutor\'s office. It\'s (INAUDIBLE) -- excuse me. It\'s very long. It\'s -- it has detail that typically\nyou wouldn\'t find in a federal indictment.\n \n\n In particular, it raises a statute that has nothing to do with the case against Libby, and that is the federal espionage\nstatute, which he gets into in some",0.3662498991099664,2005-11-14

It is truly momentous and is a defining point in the search for a lasting peace with justice. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIPS: Momentous. Everyone is saying momentous, unparalleled, Incredible, historic. What is going to make this any different from the last cease-fire in '94? And then, of course, you and I were talking about not long ago there was talk about putting down arms, but it seemed more like a political conversation more than any action being put forward. KING: I think the reason it's going to work now is that the people on the ground want it to work. The people in northern Ireland have seen that policies can work. And in addition to that, I gave Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, who is the co-leader of Sinn Fein, the credit, and also the IRA leadership, is that before they actually made today's statement, before the IRA actually put out the statement, they spoke to every member of the IRA to make sure that they were on board. This isn't like what's happened too often with the Palestinians, where the statement is made but they can't follow through. In this case everyone was canvassed, everyone had the chance to give their opinion, and then the order was finally given today that it's time for the IRA to stand down, and they will. I'm confident that it's going to work, because so much effort went in on the ground to making sure that it's going to work. And also, I have to say both President Clinton in the past and President Bush today have made it clear that if the IRA took this statement the United States would work as a guarantor to make sure the process went forward. PHILLIPS: Now, Congressman, you used to defend the IRA. What changed for you? KING: Well, I had said the IRA was a legitimate force and had to be part of any peace process. And then the peace process was set up. And at that stage, there was no longer any reason for the IRA to exist. To me, the only purpose, if there was one for the IRA, was to get a peace process in place which could bring about a peaceful solution. Once that was in place, the IRA served no useful purpose after that, and they only became an impediment to peace. And that's why back in March of this year I called for them to stand down. I met with Gerry Adams after that. We had a long conversation. And I think Gerry Adams would have done this anyway, but having Americans such as myself speak out, I think that strengthened his hand when he went back to Ireland and told the IRA, listen, even your strongest supporters say you have to stand down. This has to be made to work, and it can't be made to work so long as the IRA is an active force.",0.1628830763224673,2005-07-28

Do you think knowing the situation that this could calm it down or not? CAKIROZER (via telephone): Well, Christiane, actually today, the day started with a glimmer of hope because yesterday the prime minister stated that the prime minister was going to meet with the representatives of the protest movement tomorrow, on Wednesday. However, just very early in the morning as you have seen, now he still continues, the protesters in Taksim Square has started, it has become worse and worse during the day and I think the chances of any representative meeting with the prime minister tomorrow is near to nil. Very slim. Although early in the morning, really we were hoping that in this meeting with the prime minister, there can be some sort of consensus, some sort of dialogue at least some of the requests of the protesters might be accepted we were hoping. But now looking at what's going on there in Taksim Square, it would indicate at the very moment, I mean, it is very difficult. And it seems, as you also mentioned through your broadcasting, I mean, both the Istanbul governor and the prime minister, I mean, they don't have in their latest statements today, they haven't shown any kind of sign of dialogue with the protest movement. That's very unfortunate.

Because at the end of the day, there is no real answer. But it's American policy remains light and fluffy on that, as well there are Persians, there are Arabs, the Iraqis are firmly nationalist, there's a long history but they are scarred by the Iran/Iraq war and let's cross our fingers and hope the divisions are enough to unite them. It hasn't helped with Lebanese Hezbollah and their Arabs. It hasn't helped with Hamas and Palestine and their Arabs. There seems to be very little clarity on the main issue of this war which is America's competition for influence with Iran. Now, why that's not being drilled home? I have no idea.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry said it would support the nation's electricity grid. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, disagreed, finding it unfairly limited competition favoring coal over natural gas over renewable energy and critics say that would hurt consumers. The competitive power market is keeping electricity prices near historic lows. This plan would have costs Americans up to 4 billion more a year in energy costs, raising rates and really only helping a handful of coal companies. Alisyn.

Syria officially takes up Russia's proposal to give up control of its chemical weapons stockpile. This is a move that offers a double edge to the United States' debate as to whether or not the U.S. should strike. You have here, on the one hand, there may not be a need for the U.S. to attack Syria, period. On the other, well, that's the point the president's top staffers stressed today before the House Armed Services Committee. They say if Syria is going to hand over its stockpile to international control, the U.S. needs to keep the threat of a strike very real. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: A lot of people say that nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of a hanging. Well, it's the credible threat of force that has been on the table for these last weeks that has, for the first time, brought this regime to even acknowledge that they have a chemical weapons arsenal. CHUCK HAGEL, DEFENSE SECRETARY: We must be very clear eyed and ensure it is not a stalling tactic by Syria and its Russian patrons (ph). And for this diplomatic option to have a chance of succeeding, the threat of a U.S. military action, the credible, real threat of U.S. military action, must continue. (END VIDEO CLIP) BALDWIN: Still, there is word that President Obama is feeling less pressure to push for a strike as he's meeting with Democrats and Republicans today on Capitol Hill. Here he was. And his address to the nation tonight will have a much different tone than was planned just two days ago. Keep in mind, as Wolf mentioned, CNN's special coverage begins at 7:00 p.m. Eastern. And joining me now, chief congressional correspondent Dana Bash and CNN International anchor Hala Gorani. Dana, let me just begin with you in Washington. You know, Syria, today, the headline is that it accepts this proposal, you know, from Russia.

And this can be done in an open process, even in the midst of the ongoing war. This is no classified information, but we know exactly where the chemical weapons are. Any agreement must ensure that Syria is unable to transfer this poison to the hands of terrorists. Hezbollah, for example. Such intent would be met with a rapid response from this government, and it would be a robust response.

The organisms and other microscopic bacteria in the ocean are the foundation of the food chain. PAUL: What feeds and fuels the ecology of the ocean, and if those guys are in trouble, then the ocean is in trouble. LAVANDERA: So far, federal government scientists have downplayed the impact of microscopic oil making its way up the food chain. This is what the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said earlier this month. DR. JANE LUBCHENCO, NOAA ADMINISTRATOR: Fish will degrade that oil and process it naturally. And so it doesn't bio-accumulate. So it's not a situation where we need to be concerned about that. Over time it will be broken down. LAVANDERA: USF scientists tell CNN that's a short-sighted view of the danger. NOAA officials haven't responded to these latest scientific findings. The ten-day mission in the Gulf of Mexico was a rocky voyage. Scientists were battered with 12-foot seas and strong storms, taking them within 25 miles of the deepwater horizon spill site. All along the way they found microscopic droplets of oil all along the ocean floor. HOLLANDER: Here is a sedimentary record from an area 1,500 meters water depth adjacent to the Deepwater Horizon. LAVANDERA: Using UV light on the sediment, the microscopic oil stands out easily. HOLLANDER: You can see it all spread out all over. There is no reflections. This is all speckled, and when you turn off the light completely it looks like the southern sky. LAVANDERA (on camera): It looks like a constellation of stars. HOLLANDER: Looks like a constellation of stars. LAVANDERA (voice-over): But most troubling to David Hollander is evidence that the submerged oil is making its way through a region of the Gulf of Mexico known as the Desoto Canyon. The canyon stretches just east from the Deepwater Horizon spill site to an area south of Panama City. (on camera): So the concern is not only that you found the droplets of oil widespread but where you found it. HOLLANDER: Yes, it's coming now into niece areas that are critical marine protected areas, critical habitats for commercial and recreational fish. (END VIDEOTAPE) LAVANDERA: BP officials haven't commented on the specifics of these latest findings with these scientists, but they do tell us that they want to know everything, that everyone wants to know about the conditions of the Gulf waters. They also say they've committed some $500 million to ongoing research to find out the long-term impacts of this study. Right now those scientists are back here on the University of South Florida campus, kind of going over more testing and more analysis of that data. They will continue to do that for the weeks to come -- Ali.

Other information we have tonight from multiple law enforcement sources, Chris, police are at an address associated with the suspect, the address in Laurel, Maryland, about 30 miles away from here. Also, we're told by sources that this suspect did have a dispute with this newspaper. That he filed a defamation claim against the newspaper back in 2012. But that that claim was dismissed. This was, according to police, a targeted attack. Police saying that this suspect came in to the building, looking for his victims. And we have a very dramatic account from a survivor of the attack, Phil Davis, a crime reporter for the ""Capital Gazette."" He was here inside the building and heard the gunman reload. Phil Davis was hiding under his desk because the gunman came in. Here's his account to Anderson Cooper just a short time ago.

Really incredible when you think of the fact that they arrived here within sixty-seconds of when the shooting began. One witness said she was in a locked down business very short distance away. She could see the police responding. She said some of them were running toward the building still in their civilian clothes, pulling on their Kevlar vests as they ran into the building.

So before you or your folks logon to get your sister that new CD she's been hinting at, check out Laura Rowley's tips to make sure your cybershopping is secure. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAURA ROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Last year's holiday season was a disaster for some online retailers. The government slapped hefty fines on several sites for poor customer service. TRAVIS MORGAN, PRESIDENT & CO-FOUNDER, WEBASSURED.COM: We'd like to think that there'll be some improvement this year over last year. There's a new variable this year, though, in that there are a lot of companies sort of teetering on the brink. So I think there is some risk this season that some consumers will be left holding the bag. ROWLEY: So in this religious season, here are the commandments of online shopping. First, know thy e-tailer. MORGAN: Where they're physically located, how long they've been in business, how you can get in touch with the company directly, and most importantly what their customer service track record has been like. ROWLEY: WebAssured.com puts its seal of approval on e-merchants who agree to meet service standards and participate in a dispute resolution service. If a consumer gets burned by one of them, WebAssured will refund the money directly. BizRate.com is another site that reviews e-merchants. The second commandment: Thou shall only shop sites that have secure servers. DON WILLMOTT, TECHNOLOGY EDITOR, YAHOO! INTERNET LIFE: On your browser, you'll see a little padlock or a key depending on which browser you use. And the key is either turned or the padlock is closed, and that's your sign on the browser that you do have a secure connection. ROWLEY: Commandment three: Thou shall not e-mail thy credit card number. WILLMOTT: E-mail is not as secure. So if you're shopping and someone for some reason says, could you e-mail us your credit card number, that's something you should never do. ROWLEY: The fourth commandment: Thou shall consider e-tailers with bricks and mortar locations. WILLMOTT: In most cases, you can return or exchange the item at the physical store. So you don't need to schlep down to the mall to shop at the Gap. But if you do have to return something or the recipient wants to return it, then it's pretty much easy for them. ROWLEY (on camera): And the last commandment: Thou shall shop by December 10 or pay for expensive delivery services. That's YOUR MONEY, Laura Rowley, CNN Financial News, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) BAKHTIAR: Now, last Friday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sent letters to 100 e-tailers who promise shipment in 24 to 48 hours.

So all in all, I think we have to look at this seriously, evaluate it carefully, but I believe based on what I know now this is an important step. Thank you all very much. COSTELLO: All right. We just heard Hillary Clinton talking about this deal with Iran. Earlier she said she would as president enforce the agreement. She also said she talked with President Obama last night. He called her to tell her a deal had been reached. Let's go to our State Department correspondent Elise Labott to talk a little bit more about this. When Hillary Clinton was secretary of state she was partly responsible for bringing Iran to the table -- right? ELISE LABOTT, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: That's right. It was secretary Clinton who sent some of her envoys, her top foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan, deputy secretary Bill Burns to meet with the Iranians for secret talks over the course of a year before the Iranians came to the table. So it was interesting, Carol, it was Secretary Kerry that started that process, but as she distanced herself, as she left the State Department, as she wrote her book and started to distance herself from the administration, you saw that she was taking a much more kind of hawkish view on Iran. And while she says this is an important first step, I think it will be interesting to see what she says when she actually goes through the agreement because I think that Secretary Clinton as president would take a harder line with Iran. Don't forget, she was the one that said that President Obama was naive for thinking that you can engage Iran. So does she think that this deal would be part of a larger accommodation with Iran in the Middle East? Can you now cooperate with Iran on other areas? We'll be watching to see what she says. COSTELLO: Well, I found it interesting that President Obama called her to tell her about this deal. LABOTT: Reporter: well, I think part of that is because -- as we said, Secretary Clinton was, you know, kind of instrumental in getting this process going. And she did lead diplomacy on this arena while she was at the State Department for the last part of her administration. So I think in part it was to let her know that this has reached conclusion, to thank her for her work. But let's not kid ourselves, you know, she's also the front-runner in the Democratic Party. She's running for president, and clearly while we have to wait and see who shakes out and President Obama certainly hasn't endorsed a candidate, we know that he has spoken very favorably about a possible Clinton presidency. So I think it was a combination of looking back and looking forward. COSTELLO: Well, it was also interesting",0.206222576785002,2015-07-14

This over a resolution passed by one vote in the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, a resolution recommending that the U.S. recognize the 1915 killings of ethnic Armenians in Ottoman, Turkey as genocide. For years the Armenian government has been pressing other countries to label those events as genocide. Historians do acknowledge that the Ottoman military forced hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians into death marches into the Syrian Desert in 1915. But the Turks have always denied that a genocide took place, saying that both sides massacred each other at that time.

We learned the dignity of work, and we were told that anyone can make it if they just try hard enough. That was America's promise. And for those of us who grew up in middle-class neighborhoods like Scranton and Wilmington, that was the American dream. Ladies and gentlemen, but today, today that American dream feels like it's slowly slipping away. I don't have to tell you that. You feel it every single day in your own lives. I've never seen a time when Washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up.

Should Mom move in with us now that -- now that Dad's gone? Fifty, sixty, seventy dollars just to fill up the gas tank, how in God's name, with winter coming, how are we going to heat the home? Another year, no raise. Did you hear -- did you hear they may be cutting our health care at the company? Now -- now we owe more money on our home than our home is worth. How in God's name are we going to send the kids to college? How are we going to retire, Joe? You know, folks, that's the America that George Bush has left us.

But for many people the need is far more pressing the latest on the crisis at America's southern border. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ANDERSON: You're with ""Connect the World"", I'm Becky Anderson. The Biden Administration says it is planning a major increase in the number of refugees allowed into America. A report to Congress will recommend the cap be set at 125,000 people by next year. That is twice as many people as this ship. The administration says the change is needed to address the impact of humanitarian crises around the globe. Well, one of those crises is unfolding right now as thousands have fled Haiti, leaving behind poverty and natural disaster. The White House says it's seeking more information about what it called terrific videos which appeared to show U.S. border agents on a horseback aggressively confronting some of those migrants near the border with Mexico. U.S. Homeland Security Department calls the footage extremely troubling. But that is not deterring Haitians from attempting the long and difficult journey to seek asylum at the U.S. border.

The president may change. Who knows? But the policy won't really change, and also their right, as they claim, to have nuclear power. They say it's for peaceful purposes. They still, even if it were Mousavi, would probably say that they retain that right. However, Kitty, I did talk with a couple of experts who believe there might be shades of difference, that they might be more open to, let's say, having the international community observe what they are doing. So, there could be some changes. But it's a long way before this election apparently is going to be settled. PILGRIM: It's a very critical issue. Thanks very much for your analysis tonight. Jill Dougherty at the State Department and Dan Lothian at the White House; thank you very much. LOTHIAN: Thank you. PILGRIM: Iranians appear to be much more enthusiastic about their version of democracy than many Americans are about theirs. That is if voter turnout is any indication. We looked at turnout in Iran; we compared it with voter turnout in Virginia's Democratic primary. Early estimates say more than 70 percent Iranian voters took part in today's presidential election; that's a possible record. That compares with a turnout of just 6 percent in the Democratic primary of Virginia this week. Only 320,000 Virginians participated in that primary. Let's turn to another important international story: the diplomatic showdown over North Korea. The United Nations Security Council today voted unanimously to expand sanctions against North Korea. And that in response to Pyongyang's recent nuclear weapons test. Communist China and Russia were among the nations voting in favor of the sanctions. U.N. member states will now have the authority to inspect North Korean cargo on the high seas. North Korean leader, Kim Jong-Il, tonight appears to be closer to declaring his youngest son a successor. Published reports show that Kim's son is being called ""Brilliant Comrade"" in North Korea. The North Korean leader reported suffered a stroke last year and he's apparently in poor health ever since.

Yes, I do believe that. I think we will have a much better-- like I said we have 60 percent of the delegates. With we need 1237 to take our nomination. More voters will have an opportunity to be involved in this process than ever before. And come the end of March, you will hopefully see the emergence of a presumptive nominee. I think we are confident by mid April you will have an idea who our nominee will be. (END VIDEO CLIP) SCIUTTO: We're two months to the day. Are you confident you will have a nominee uncontested in time for the convention in July? SPICER: Clearly, it is still possible. I think one part I was right about is more voters did participate in the process than ever before. The turnout has been spectacular. We have had record numbers of participation in almost every state. As we get more contests under our belt, we have a big surprise in New York coming up with 95 delegates it's becoming apparent there is a greater possible of an open convention. On the last day of voting, June 7th, you have 172 in California alone. That means it will be June 7th before we have an answer to the question you are asking. But I think as each contest goes by the likelihood it is an open convention and no one has the bound 1237 delegates to take the nomination gets greater. SCIUTTO: You heard, I'm sure, criticism from the Trump campaign after Colorado, calling it a rigged vote. You had the Trump strategist Paul Manafort calling them Cruz's tactics. We had Steven Miller of the Trump campaign on a few minutes ago saying the process was undemocratic. What's your response? SPICER: Well, you pointed it out. All of these states and territories submitted plans last year as to how they would allocate their delegates. That process was made to every campaign starting last year. Candidates and campaigns shouldn't be surprised as to how the allocation or the selection of those allocated delegates works. It is up to them to win a state and go in and fight to have their slate or delegates get elected. But there's two differences. Number one, in states where a candidate has won the delegates, it comes down to a person that gets selected. That person that is selected is bound by whatever the state rules are. So Trump wins a delegate in a state and then someone else, someone runs for that slot, the selection of that, regardless of who that person, they are bound to vote for the candidate that was allocated.

So, does the president now have regrets over his opposition to the surge? MCDONOUGH: What he has is great, deep appreciation for all the troops that made this possible. Obviously, as he indicated then and has since, he recognized that it would not be the surge alone, but obviously, the Iraqis taking charge of their own future that would allow us to make the kind of progress that we've seen over the last couple of years. We think there's lessons in that for Iraq, but also for Afghanistan. That's why you see the president is dedicating this extraordinary level of additional resources over a course of a specified period of time to try to help the Afghans make the kind of progress that the Iraqis have made. So that's exactly what we're working for, and that's what you'll hear from him tonight. BLITZER: I'm going to get to Afghanistan in a moment, but General Odierno, the outgoing U.S. military commander in Iraq, he's concerned that if there's no new government formed there within the next month or so, it's been almost six months since the last election, that the whole situation in Iraq could deteriorate. We could see Sunni and Shia and Kurdish elements back fighting each other. Are you as worried about that as General Odierno seems to be? MCDONOUGH: Well, we all get paid to worry around here. And nobody does a better job of preparing and planning and seeing around the corners than General Odierno. But let's remember a couple things. One, there's a caretaker government in place. They're making decisions for the Iraqi -- Iraqi people now. The Iraqi security forces are on the move. They're leaning forward. They're demonstrating, over the course of the last year, that they're being very effective as they've taken over pieces of their country. And starting tomorrow they'll be in the lead across the country with a strong 50,000-person force from the United States and support and obviously able to undertake counterterrorism efforts as needed. So obviously, we're focused on this. That's why the vice president is there now on his sixth trip to try to help the Iraqis make these kind of difficult choices. But we are focused on the trend lines as well, too. And those trend lines are positive. Violence is down. Capacity is up. And obviously, as you heard from Prime Minister Maliki this morning, hope is up over there, as well, too. BLITZER: Let's talk about Afghanistan for a moment, because I'm sure the president will address that subject in his Oval office address later tonight. He's made it clear that, starting in July of next year, 2011, he wants to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.

They seem to primarily target taxis, but passengers in other vehicles were also robbed.

They brought them back to the urban centers, and every single country now is trying to work out how best they could avoid another lockdown, and get the numbers that are even now spiraling out of control in several European states, back under control. And for now, no one has really found that balance. QUEST: And is -- if I compare it to what's happening in the U.K. with Boris Johnson who had initially everybody thought have done a good job, or at least not a bad job, in the early parts of the pandemic, perhaps out of sympathy for the man who caught it. But now rounding on him on the government strategy, is it the same in France, where Macron who seemed to lead quite strongly initially, what are people now saying? BELL: I think if anything, this is probably giving him something of a boost. I think the French government has been fairly open about what it was doing. It has listened to the science. It's been as clear as it could be. One of the conundrums really is how this second wave could have happened in a country that had dealt so well with the first wave. I think it doesn't bode well really for other countries. BELL: Emmanuel Macron in a way has benefited from this crisis. He is more well-liked probably than he was because in a time of crisis, all of the issues that have troubled France so much these last few years, suddenly seemed less urgent. But of course, the important thing now in the second wave, and I think this is a problem for a number of European countries is that they're dealing with a far more political issue. The first wave was fairly simple, you shut it down.

POLITAN: If the civil suits go forward, like the Zenaida Gonzalez suit, she has to sit down in a deposition and answer questions without getting paid. And she doesn't want to do that. That's why she appealed her criminal convictions, which she's already served her time for. That's why she's filed bankruptcy, hoping it all goes away so she can get paid to talk, because she doesn't want to tell her story and answer qui questions without getting paid. BANFIELD: Let me ask you this. And I won't suggest for a minute that she's been doing this, but if she's been secretly talking to the Dr. Phil's of the word and forging a $3 million to $10 million deal for that first interview, if she gets the bankruptcy proceeding her way, and she's declared bankrupt, and then, in a six month period, magically comes up with a $5 million deal, can she keep all that money? SMITH: Oh, no. She won't be able to keep it all. It depends on what the bankruptcy court decides. But would you rather, let's say, get that money in, maybe you got to pay off Jose Baez and others, or you get that money and you still got to pay or millions to the possible creditors that could you have through those lawsuits. What they want to happen is make the lawsuits go away, the civil suits, with the Zenaida Gonzalez's and everybody else. Therefore, all I just have to worry about the $750,000 that I owe and maybe I'll make some off the top. BANFIELD: I still don't understand why it's a defamation case for Zenaida because you have to have some kind of malice, and she didn't even know who she was. She just picked the name out of -- (CROSSTALK) POLITAN: She's a member of the private sector and not a public figure. BANFIELD: Right. A public figure.

A 19-year-old California man faces one count of attempted murder in the shooting that paralyzed a U.S. Army soldier during a party to welcome him home. Ruben Jurado turned himself in yesterday. Police have identified victims of that brutal Christmas day shooting in a Dallas suburb. Aziz Yazdanapah, dressed as Santa Claus, allegedly killed his estranged wife, their two children, and three other family members before turning the gun on himself. The couple was separated. Court records show the suspect had filed for bankruptcy and was still living in the family's foreclosed home. The Los Angeles Coroner's Office says rapper Heavy D died of a blood clot in his lung caused by deep leg vein thrombosis. The 44- year-old Dwight Arrington Myers also suffered from heart disease. Heavy D died December 8 after collapsing at his Beverly Hills home.

Earlier this month Mitch found $10,000 in two sealed envelopes at Las Vegas Airport while waiting for his flight. He could have pocketed the cash but instead, he tracked down the rightful owner, an El Paso man who had dropped the money while running to catch a flight. He got his cash back in time for Christmas. As for Mitch, he said he wanted to show his kids the right thing to do, and he'd also want someone to do the same for him. And a programming note. We are just a few days from away from 2012.

1404660,1719143,CNN,Fareed Zakaria Gps,"FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST: This is GPS, the GLOBAL PUBLIC SQUARE. Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world. I'm Fareed Zakaria. We have a terrific show for you today. First up, is the self-declared Islamic State really Islamic? And what's in a name anyway? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Al Qaeda, ISIL and groups like it are desperate for legitimacy. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZAKARIA: How should we describe and deal with the phenomenon the president calls violent extremism? Then how do we win the fight against the terror group on a new battlefield? I'll explain. Also John Chambers, the chairman and CEO of Cisco on disruptive technologies, the state of the economy and how the Internet of everything will transform your life. Finally, a fascinating preview of the next few decades in which the United States will stay right on top. You won't want to miss this. But first here's my take. President Obama stands accused of political correctness for his unwillingness to accuse groups like ISIS of Islamic extremism, choosing a more generic term, violent extremism. His critics say you cannot fight an enemy that you will not name. Even his supporters feel that his approach is to professorial. But far from being a scholar concerned with describing the phenomenon accurately, the president is actually deliberately choosing not to emphasize ISIS' religious dimension for political and strategic reasons. After all, what would the practical consequences be of describing ISIS as Islamic? Would the West drop more bombs on it? No. But it would make many Muslims feel that their religion had been unfairly maligned and it would dishearten Muslim leaders who have continually denounced ISIS as a group that does not represent Islam. But Graeme Wood writes in a much discussed cover-essay in the ""Atlantic"" this month, ""The Islamic State is Islamic -- very Islamic."" Wood's essays is an intelligent and detailed account of the ideology that animates the Islamic State. These are not secular people with rational goals, he argues, they really do believe in their religious ideology. But Wood's essay reminds me of some of the breathless tracks written during the Cold War that pointed out that the communists really, really believed in communism. Of course, many ISIS leaders do believe their ideology. The real question is, why has this ideology sprung up at this moment and why is it attractive to a group, a tiny group of Muslim men these days? Wood describes ISIS as having revived traditions that have been dormant for hundreds of years. Exactly. ISIS has rediscovered, even reinvented, a version of Islam for its own purposes today. Wood is much taken by the Princeton academic, Bernard Haykel, who claims that people want to turn a blind eye to the ideology of ISIS for political reasons. Quote, ""People want to absolve Islam,"" Wood quote Haykel as saying. ""It's this Islam is a religion of peace mantra, as if there is such a",0.3135560675883256,2015-02-22

You know, every -- you know, every qualified engineer, and software developer not just in the United States but in the world, as well as lawyers and others who are interested in the tech field, have their pick of companies to work for. And they come to Amazon because it's a great place to work and because they find it challenging and they love the ethos that we're all focused on, delivering for the customer. And they also like the fact, that unlike a lot of workplaces, including places I've worked, it is absolutely standard and expected to question everybody's ideas and anybody can have a good idea. It doesn't have to be the person at the top. It can be the person in the middle or the bottom. SCIUTTO: Let me ask you about this, specifically some of the issues that were raised. This morning you said that the company had not had a chance to check out some of these stories that former employees quoted in ""The Times"" piece. Have you been able to answer some of those questions since then? CARNEY: Sure. I mean, we're continuing to work on this. Our human -- our HR department is working on that. And, you know, as I think Jeff Bezos said in his memo to Amazonians from last night and this morning, you know, we want to know, he wants to know if any of the behavior, managerial behavior that was reported on this story is actually true. It's intolerable. We won't accept it. And, you know, Amazon is not perfect. We're an organization, Jim, that has grown in five years from 28,000 employees, already a big company, to 183,000 employees. And again, 150,000 people, 150,000 new jobs wouldn't be created and filled if people didn't want to work at Amazon. And when we're talking about the white collar workforce, again, these are people who could work anywhere. And in some cases, at the most senior levels, these are people, because they have been so successful, who don't have to work but they love coming to work at Amazon because it's an innovative and creative place to be. SCIUTTO: And I want to be fair. For instance, there's a current employee, Amazon's head of infrastructure that posted -- he posted a 5,000-word defense of the company on LinkedIn today and talked about how the phrase to criticism ratio is 5-1 in these internal systems. So, I do want to acknowledge that. But let's look at specific policies, one being the paternity leave policy -- having just had a baby, something close to my heart.

He's taken a brief, prescheduled departure from his working vacation here in New Jersey. He is back at the White House at this hour. He will be meeting shortly with the attorney general and the director of the FBI. I am told by a White House official that they expect him to take questions about Charlottesville and other matters later this afternoon. But we will see what the president says about this. He, of course, keeps his own counsel on this. Many advisers have urged him to say something. They also, I'm told, believe that all this, you know, blowback is misplaced as you can hear from the attorney general. But there's no question, Kate, this has consumed his August vacation, at least this part of it. It was left to his vice president, Mike Pence, who is traveling in South America, to talk directly about this. Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate. I will say, I take issue with the fact many in the national media spend more time criticizing the president's words than they did criticizing those who perpetrated the violence to begin with. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZELENY: So, that was something, Kate, you heard the vice president again going after the media and others for the coverage of this. But the issue here is the Republican members of Congress, the House, the Senate, the bipartisan group of governors have come out and condemned this and have called on the president to specifically and directly condemn the white supremacist here. So, I think you have a window into the mindset of the president and the White House here with the vice president's remarks there. We do expect him to talk about it again today. But one White House official told me earlier today, Kate, it's his call how much he directly talks about this. It's a fascinating moment for this president. Many of his supporters would like him to issue some moral clarity on this and move on. But we'll see what he does later today -- Kate. BOLDUAN: Yes. In terms of if it's his call, it always has been, it was when he made his initial statement and it will be now. So, exactly right. Great to see you. Jeff, thanks so much. A lot to come.

But it was fundamentally the same growth path and job creation path that we were on. Actually, slightly slower, the job creation. But, no. Donald Trump the nature of Donald Trump psyche is that he calls himself a cheer leader. He likes to take credit for good things that have happened.

I appreciate it. I want to bring in now Dr. William Schaffner. He is a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. Doctor, thank you for joining again. Good to see you. Listen, I spoke with Dr. Chris Murray in the last hour. He is responsible for the model used by the White House to forecast coronavirus fallout. He told me that he is now increasing the predicted death toll to 74,000. Take a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTOPHER MURRAY, DIRECTOR, INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH METRICS AND EVALUATION: We're just seeing the steady rise. You're seeing it in case numbers as well. There's a lot of signs that we're sort of trending down, but there are some signs here that things are not quite on the same trajectory that they were a week ago or 10 days ago. LEMON: OK. So then what's the lesson? What is the take away from these numbers going up to 74,000? MURRAY: Well, you know, we were trying to give some evidence, some scientific basis for thinking about when social distancing might be relaxed. There's always going to be a risk. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: Multiple states are -- multiple states are planning to reopen in the next few weeks. How concerning is that? WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, PROFESSOR OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY: Well, we're all concerned of course. Because we want to make progress slowly, and carefully and safely. And with states opening up who, and some of those states don't seem to have met the criteria in phase one. That's been laid out in the national plan. We're of course worried that this coronavirus which cleverly knows how to be transmitted from person to person will have a field day. As people get out and about and get close to each other and get a little more lax in social distancing. And that will result in more people coming in to the hospital I'm afraid.

That goes to a central headquarters. Then they get directed to a map and other section of the ground there. But you know, one of the biggest challenges in this and this just gives you some idea -- we talked about, you know, the physical challenges of getting in on the ground. How you have to be winched down. But get this, you know, the teams on the ground, these two men on each team, one is a recovery expert.

Because - and I talked to investigators, I mean, they are walking in the field of debris and remains with just the utmost respect, obviously, for these 150 souls on board. But how is it that they will then take the remains, and with the help of family members, identify these passengers? ROBERTSON: Well, it's absolutely with dignity. I mean, that's what we're hearing here's. It's not also without trauma for these recovery experts and the police mountaineering experts with them. None of them have been prepared for this. It's a very traumatic site as this been described to us. And the police, you know, they tell us that they've been able to recover a few bodies intact but not many.

Here's something that I noticed when I was there. When there's a hurricane in Virginia, and I go out to, like, thank the work crews, a lot of the work crews are utility linemen from West Virginia or Indiana who go in and help out, just like our crews go to other states. There weren't other crews there when I was there. So, I don't -- I'm not sure why Puerto Rico has signed these mutual aid agreements with other utilities, but there weren't other people there helping... CAMEROTA: Who are you calling on to do more? KAINE: Well, Congress has got to do more. So the president put in a request last week for $29 billion. It was $29 billion, but $16 billion was to fix the federal flood insurance program, and half a billion was for wildfires. So it's about 12 billion for Puerto Rico. Hurricane Sandy was 50 to 80. Katrina was 100 billion. So this is just a tiny, tiny little -- hopefully, down payment. I challenge the administration: this is too small. And they said, ""This is to get us through the year and we have to do more."" But we've got to get to the bottom of this electricity grid situation. Because as you know, you can't run an economy, manufacturing, without a power system. CAMEROTA: Well, they're in dire straits. I mean, everyone there is in dire straits. I don't know how they're going to get back to work; I don't know how they're going to rebuild. But you're saying that, if the president asked for more billions, that Congress would authorize that? KAINE: We're going to have to. I think we should immediately act on the first request to get us through year end. There still is an assessment that has to be done. But the second thing is we've got to build a resilient power grid in Puerto Rico, help them do that, so that they can get their economy back up and running. You see a mass exodus of people leaving Puerto Rico. You know, moving to other places. They'd rather live at home. We ought to help them get that power grid back up and running. CAMEROTA: President Trump says that you're not giving him enough credit. He tweeted this: ""Nobody could have done what I've done for Puerto Rico with so little appreciation. So much work.""

To use this as a reason that we're not going to say anything about this, it's just -- it's un- American. That's not what we do as America.

A veteran lawmaker is offering some clues. And two women married in a civil union now apart and fighting over custody of the daughter. The case is even more complicated because one of the women says she is not a lesbian anymore.

HENRY: The charge he has too much on the plate usually comes from Republicans. This time, it is Democrat Daniel Inouye, who speaks with authority after serving in the Senate with 10 presidents now. INOUYE: Five months ago, we were at some very informal gathering, and the president looked at me. He says, well, ""Dan, how am I doing?""

What do our military and our intelligence leaders do\nnow? Haven`t they been really wounded on this front?\n \n\n JACOBS: Yes, they probably have been but I don`t think mortally wounded. I think they are working very, very hard to\ntry to wrap this thing up. I don`t think they are going to be successful unless they concentrate more on areas where they\nmight be able to get the rest of these people who are part of the regime, and gaining control of the areas against American\nparticipation in the redevelopment of Iraq. Part of the problem here is that there is no government in Iraq. And until there\nis some semblance of Iraqi control over Iraq, you`re going to continue to have this problem, and it might steadily erode.\n \n\n BUCHANAN: Colonel, having been in Vietnam, I`m sure you`re familiar with the phrase ""privileged sanctuary."" The Americans\nconducted a very successful operation. They hit some of these Iraqis at about 3:00 in the morning one morning and they found\na number of Arabs there. And when you consider that Syria could be a privileged sanctuary for Arabs who want to attack Americans,\nas could Iran, can the United States successfully put down this guerrilla operation, this terrorist operation, this intifadah,\nas long as the enemy can operate out of those privileged sanctuaries and they serve as sources of troops?\n \n\n JACOBS: Well, I think it is going to be difficult but not impossible. I was surprised that we didn`t go into Syria right\naway, if for no other reason than to search with the weapons of mass destruction, which we had some degree of confidence had\nbeen spirited into Syria. On the other hand, a lot of these people who were coming in from other countries have been inside\nIraq for quite some time. It`s much more difficult for them to infiltrate now but they` re already there. I believe that they`\nre receiving some semblance of support from the population in and around the triangle that you` re talking about, particularly\nnortheast -- - northwest of Baghdad where there was great support for Saddam Hussein.\n \n\n BUCHANAN: OK, Colonel, thanks very much for joining us, and have a good weekend.\n \n\n JACOBS: And you.\n \n\n BUCHANAN: OK, and we`ll be back, Kiki and I.

He was flying from Paris to Miami, didn't have a bag, and they just said, you know, ""Get on. Enjoy your flight, sir."" GREENFIELD: How many -- how many people get on flights every day? I'm surprised this doesn't happen more. If you consider the amount of people they have, and the fact that they do not have the security in place in Europe and in other parts -- in parts of America, I'm thrilled that this doesn't happen more...

They have armed guards at the gate. They have armed guards at the gates, right. SCHLUSSEL: Well, Miles, I think it shows that really the security is not much tighter than it was before. And everything we're seeing with the long lines is a really a pretense. The fact is, they don't check most of the luggage. They don't X-ray it. So even if he had luggage, maybe if there was a bomb in there, it probably would have exploded. But I think the other lesson here is that he was immediately subdued by passengers. And they now know that it's either them or the hijackers. Whereas before, they thought there was a chance of negotiating with hijackers. And I think it's terrific that the plot was foiled. But I think airport security is the same as it was before, it's just longer lines and more problems than answers. GREENFIELD: Yes, I've got to tell you, it's not like -- it's not like it was before, because no one had to wait three hours three months ago. SCHLUSSEL: Right. I said there's...

That it's could be potentially be a turning point for North and South Korea, and also knowing full well that there will be a tremendous amount of skepticism out there. This isn't the first time that North and South Korea have had the leaders embracing, and shaking hands, and smiling, and signing a declaration. This is not the first time. But for Moon Jae-in's point of view, the Blue House says that his key effort is to make sure that Washington was brought along this time as well, believing the before this declarations and agreements didn't hold, and they couldn't carry out all the pledges because the U.S. did not fully support them.

We're following all of the latest developments, as thousands and thousands of people continue to defy the curfew. A team of heavily armed U.S. Marines has been sent to the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to provide additional security.

They're much heavier -- a heavier hand in terms of controlling access to some of the areas where people have been protesting -- controlling some of the choke points to that, limiting where people could go in order to get to the protests. But the protest -- the people turned out, still, in large numbers down in Liberation Square. I was down there for several hours today.

RANDALL: Mike, one final question, will this be enough for the Palestinians to formally back away from the September 13 deadline for declaring an independent Palestinian state? Indications are that, yes, it may indeed be. Incidentally, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said earlier on in this week that if this declaration of the state was postponed, he would regard this as a very encouraging sign of progress, and for every indication from sources in Gaza, where the Palestinian council is meeting, it does agree that there will be a postponement of such of the September the 13 date. September 13, incidentally, was not a hard and fast date; it was the date in which Yasser Arafat said repeatedly, he could choose to impose a unilateral sense of -- state of Palestinian independence should he wish. However, it does appear that the counsel is going to decide against this. And this particular deadline, which has been a sword in the necks of the negotiators for many weeks now, does appear to be about to be moved back -- Gene.

RANDALL: Now you heard Mike Hanna suggest that the Palestinians might look for agreement on other issues besides Jerusalem, hoping to develop some kind momentum that would carry into the Jerusalem situation, but is it possible to develop the kind of momentum that would be necessary to bridge this very, very serious gap?

Is he -- I know he`s been interviewed. What`s his part in this, according to you? HEFFERNAN: Well, he`s obviously a very important person to the case. And we have been in constant communication with him. We`ve been able to talk to them. Every time that we`ve been over there to talk to him, he`s made no effort to hide from us. He`s available to us, or has been whenever we want to talk. So, it`s not been an issue. VELEZ-MITCHELL: Sergeant, let me ask you this.

So I understand cadaver dogs have searched that van, not necessarily come up with anything. But a couple of questions. Did you talk to the 4- year-old girl? Because she might have seen something.

And the only reason we were not there when the gunmen arrived is we were coming back from an assignment. But you could drive the car virtually to the front door. And there was a fairly rudimentary scanning device and a guard looking -- giving a cursory look inside briefcases. So security certainly wasn't that high. HOLMES: All right. Our Andrew Stevens there, making a point there about the security at these hotels. Jim Clancy here with me, my colleague from CNN International. The Oberoi Hotel that you have spent some time in, what was security like when you were there? CLANCY: Well, you know, security was a bit better than that. There were people, from time to time, checking vehicles in the parking lot. And I think that's a fairly common practice, but perhaps not all of the time. And we have heard reports that they have stood down some of the more intense security when we were -- listened to some of the people tell us what had been going on in Mumbai. Obviously, these hotels -- these luxury hotels that were hubs for foreigners, international travelers and businesspeople, they well knew that they could be targets of terror. Did they let their guard down here? That's going to be something that's debated, I'm sure, in the hours, the days, the weeks ahead. But at this hour, you know, it would seem that -- what makes sense here is that any group of three or four people armed with automatic weapons could overpower any security that I ever saw at any of these hotels. They just weren't prepared for that. They had scanners to look and make sure they weren't bringing in a bomb. But these would appear to be people that were willing to risk or give their own lives in order to get into that hotel.

Is Russia trying to influence this U.S. election in order to get Donald Trump elected? MCCAUL: Well, I think the question is, are they trying to influence or just trying to undermine our electoral process? I think the FBI director would tell you they are trying to just undermine the integrity of the process. It's important to note, Wolf, that they have not only hacked into the DNC, but also into the RNC. They are not discriminating one party against the other. The Russians are basically -- have hacked into both parties at the national level and that gives us all concern about what their motivations are. BLITZER: Mr. Chairman, I haven't heard about any Russian hacking of the Republican National Committee. I have heard a lot about the Democratic National Committee. But you're giving us new information. You're telling us that the Russians have hacked RNC e-mails and other documents? MCCAUL: Yes. They have hacked into the Republican National Committee. So, this is -- again, they are not picking sides here, I don't think. They are hacking into both political parties. What they intend to do with that information, I don't know. It was interesting to watch Mr. Putin talk about how Russia had nothing to do with this, but how it was good to be transparent, for this to come out publicly. I don't trust Mr. Putin. I don't trust his intentions. I think Russia is not our friend here either. They are one of the biggest cyber-offenders in the world and next to the United States are the greatest challenge that we have in cyber. BLITZER: You're raising some serious questions. The RNC hack, if in fact it occurred, as you say it did, we haven't seen what they hacked. In other words, the e-mails have not been released. We did see a lot of e-mails released from the Democratic National Committee that resulted in the resignation of the chair of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. What you're saying is, based on the information you have, they have hacked into the RNC, but they haven't released any of those documents; is that right? MCCAUL: That's correct. But they have infiltrated both parties at the national level. They have hacked into both parties. They have information from both parties. Why they have released some documents and not others, we don't know those intentions. And that is -- the ongoing FBI investigation's purpose right now is to do attribution.

He has provided information to special counsel Robert Mueller and he is about to hand over data and ad and information to Congress as well. Here is some of what Zuckerberg said in a Facebook live interview earlier this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: When someone buys political ads on TV or other media, they are required by law to disclose who paid for them. So, we're going to bring Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency. (END VIDEO CLIP) STELTER: It's interesting, right? No more anonymity, he says. Zuckerberg says Facebook will make sure you can see who's buying political ads. If a campaign is targeting your mom on Facebook but not you, you'll still be able to see the ads and find out how people are being influenced. But Senator Mark Warner, the lead Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, wants to make sure this becomes law, not just voluntary by Facebook but enforceable law. Warner and fellow Democrat Amy Klobuchar prepared a legislation that would force Facebook and Twitter and others to keep public records of political ads. I spoke with Warner earlier in his first-depth about the effort. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STELTER: Senator, thank you so much for joining me. SEN. MARK WARNER (D), SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Thank you, Brian. STELTER: Facebook says it's going to go ahead and voluntarily implement this kind of disclosure. That's what Mark Zuckerberg announced a few days ago. Is that enough? Voluntary disclosure by Facebook? WARNER: Well, listen, I'm glad that Facebook has finally stepped forward. Ten months ago I started raising this issue. Ten months ago Facebook was saying, hey, that's crazy, there was no Russian interference, there was no Russian involvement. Well, we've seen now there was dramatic Russian involvement, both in terms of paid advertising, as well as these so-called fake accounts and we still don't know the total number of fake accounts. I don't think we know the full extent of the Russian advertising. I'm glad that Facebook has finally stepped forward. I wish they would have stepped forward much earlier. We will be -- you know, the proof of how thorough Facebook will be is -- will be in the coming weeks. We have not received any of their information yet. They will disclose that to us next week. We want to try to find a way then to make some of the those ads and other information public because at the end of the day this is really about the public's need to know, both the source of the content that's coming at",0.0414301784527279,2017-09-24

They may have public hearings. That process could take a few weeks. But potentially, going to the floor, the week before Christmas could be articles of impeachment. All of this could be wrapped up in the House of Representatives just before the holiday. (END VIDEOTAPE) ALLEN: Let's talk about these developments. Joining me now from London is Thomas Gift, a lecturer in political science at University College. It is good to see you and good morning. THOMAS GIFT, POLITICAL SCIENCE LECTURER, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Great to see you, Natalie. ALLEN: Let's begin with the top State Department official testifying Thursday that Mr. Trump wanted the president of Ukraine to announce an investigation that would help Trump politically. It's more of the same Democrats have heard. This corroborates the key part of their impeachment case. How damning is yet more testimony like this for the U.S. president? GIFT: I don't think that Kent's testimony is the game-changer, but certainly not good news for the president or his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. It did provide more confirmation that Giuliani was operating essentially a shadow foreign policy with Ukraine. What struck me most about the testimony was the strength of tense language, saying, for example, that Giuliani was engaged in a ""campaign of slander"" against Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and that he was pursuing a classic disinformation operation. He took the criticism a lot further than many others. Kent's testimony was also unique in that he did express questions about Hunter Biden and his role in the oil and gas company, Burisma, which of course Republicans will latch on to. However, it seemed to be more about the optics of him serving on the board rather than any clear evidence that he or Joe Biden did something unethical. ALLEN: This official, Mr. Kent, will testify in public hearings that begin next week. With the slow drip of evidence continuing to drip, how significant might these public hearings be? GIFT: I think they are very significant because up until this point, everything has really been happening behind closed doors. So far, Republicans have been able to make the case that this is all problems of process, that nothing is out in the open, and that this is sort of a crypto impeachment, and so on. And so this will really be the first time that Americans are able to see these individuals testifying in public. I think that probably will add to the momentum of this impeachment inquiry. Certainly, Democrats are hoping that it will. ALLEN: Right. Let's talk about some other Democrats on this campaign trail. Former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg indicating he might be worried about whether the current field of candidates can beat Trump in 2020. He might jump in there. How would you view a Bloomberg candidacy? GIFT: Well, there are two things that you need to",0.1236258531183819,2019-11-08

KIRSTEN POWERS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I'm glad you brought up domestic violence because this is more offensive to you, it seems, maybe and certainly to these players than all the domestic violence -- MARTIN: Oh come on. POWERS: -- ""disrespecting the flag."" I never saw this kind of reaction when you've had time after time these players accused -- (CROSSTALK) POWERS: -- there was never this level of reaction. And where was Donald Trump's tweet storms about it? I mean, I don't remember that. So I just want to say -- can you just not interrupt me for one second? MARTIN: Literally, it's literally when did you stop beating your wife? He was -- POWERS: Let me finish. MARTIN: I mean, literally you just said that. COOPER: Let her finish. POWERS: OK. MARTIN: Go ahead. POWERS: Can I talk? MARTIN: Go for it. POWERS: Yes, I think that the point is that people should matter more than a symbol and that doesn't mean the flag isn't important. The point is there are people that are trying to tell you that something is wrong. And for you to say I just turned on the T.V. and your job is to entertain me, like, that's not very respectful to people. CUCCINELLI: They can protest whenever they want but not on the job. POWERS: No, but they need to protest when people are paying attention, and so for that, and this is the place (INAUDIBLE). So if you have any respect for them, just the tiniest bit of respect for them, you should stop and think, these are people I come to watch play and I respect them as athletes but I also respect them as human beings and I want to hear what they have to say. I mean, aren't you curious about -- JONES: And part of thing I -- I'll add that is that -- it's not like the political people are dealing with this issue of police misconduct. In fact, Donald Trump has got the car going in reverse. Obama at least tried to deal with it. Now the Department of Justice under Trump is going backwards. So when are they supposed to speak up, when the African-American folks are marching down the street and it's called Black Lives Matter, that get criticized. When somebody tweets, I guess, criticize. When it's on the air, whether on the field, when they kneel, when they stand -- at a certain point it starts to feel like Donald Trump doesn't want to hear black folks has a period and that is very concerning to people.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BERTHA LEWIS, ACORN CHIEF ORGANIZER: Well, I'm not worried whatsoever because here's why. First of all, in every county when you register voters, you've got to turn in every single card no matter how weird or wacko it may appear, that's the law. We train our voter registration workers. We try to verify those people who registered three times on the phone, if we can't, guess, what we flag them, we tag them, we bundle them, turn them into the authorities. It is a little particular that we've been doing this for 18 months, we turn them in every two weeks and I guess they're trying to make it appear as if all of these just showed up at once. But you know what else is good? The system actually works because any new voter is going to have to come and show their I.D. (END VIDEO CLIP) NGUYEN: OK, so let's talk more about this. Steve Carbo is with Demos.org which is working on voter registration. He joins us from New York and Keith Appell, is a Republican strategist who joins us from Washington. Steve, let me talk to you first because in looking at Drew's piece, we're talking about what hundred, perhaps even thousands, of false information here on voter registration applications and that's the ones that have been spotted. I mean, are these numbers inflated here or is ACORN truly involved in voter fraud? STEVE CARBO, DEMOS.ORG: Well, I think we need to be clear about what voter fraud is. The record shows that it's exceedingly rare for individuals to show up on the polls on Election Day and pretend to be other people, to vote twice, to vote illegally. That's the kind of voter fraud... NGUYEN: But isn't something inherently wrong if the information on the application is incorrect? You've seen other cases where you have the Dallas Cowboys listed on applications in Nevada. CARBO: That's right. And what we're seeing is that the system is working. It's picking up questionable voter registration forms so that those folks don't get on to the voter rolls. If someone registers, for instance, at Jimmy Johns and it's a restaurant chain or Mickey Mouse, you don't see Mickey Mouse showing up on Election Day saying I'm Mickey Mouse, I want to vote today.

LEON HARRIS, CNN ANCHOR: A California jury has found a doctor liable for recklessness and abuse for not providing enough pain medication for an elderly patient. As CNN's James Hattori reports this morning, the judgment could have some far-reaching implications for treating pain. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JAMES HATTORI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): William Bergman's children say they knew the odds were against them in court, but a jury found the doctor who treated their father in his dying days was reckless and liable for elderly abuse because he didn't prescribe enough pain medication. ROBERT BERGMAN, PATIENT'S SON: We knew that if we told our story, we told the truth, and put it in front of people, that, hopefully, they would see where we were coming from and that this did not need to happen. HATTORI: Eighty-five year old William Bergman, a terminal cancer patient, died in February 1998 after spending six days at Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley, California. Bergman's children say he suffered needlessly because Dr. Wing Chin didn't administer enough painkillers. BEVERLY BERGMAN, PATIENT'S DAUGHTER: When you're reckless in treating a person with chronic pain or intractable pain, there are consequences. I think that's what the -- that's what the jury said. HATTORI: During the month-long trial, Dr. Chin testified he followed established pain management protocol. BOB SLATTERY, ATTORNEY FOR CHIN: Well quite frankly, I think that the doctor complied with the standard of care, that the evidence that we produced showed that. HATTORI: Family members acknowledged on the stand they didn't directly ask the doctor for more medication. B. BERGMAN: We trusted that they knew what they were doing to relieve my father's pain. HATTORI: Advocates for terminally ill patients say undermedication for pain is a widespread problem. JIM GEAGAN, FAMILY'S ATTORNEY: I think the effect of this is going to be a tremendous increase in consciousness in California and, I hope, in the country that physicians have to make pain management a priority. HATTORI (on camera): Bergman's family chose to sue for elder abuse because California's malpractice laws don't allow pain-and- suffering awards to deceased patients. The jury award, $1.5 million, is likely to be reduced to $250,000 to comply with a state cap on awards. James Hattori, CNN, San Francisco.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera) : Canadian health officials describe it as a tight race now between the vaccines and the variants. But doctors across the country say already, it is no contest. New variants are partly fueling a menacing third wave of the pandemic that is overwhelming hospital. DR. KASHIF PIRZADA, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN: I It's getting pretty alarming here. It's spreading quickly and it is much faster than the last two waves, and the people filling the ICU right now are all in their 30s, 40s and 50s. NEWTON: Dr. Kashif Pirzada is an emergency physician in Toronto and he re-posted these lung scans to warn younger Canadians about the risk. The one on the left shows healthy lungs, the scan on the right, that of a COVID patient in their 30s, the white splotches fluid buildup because of COVID-19 Leaving an otherwise healthy patient to feel like they are drowning, he says. DR. PIRZADA: It's hitting younger people harder and faster than before. The variants have changed the game completely. NEWTON: And Canada's top doctor backs that assessment saying variants are up 64 percent in the last week alone, more than 90 percent of them the B117 variant first detected in the U.K. She says they are contributing to more severe illness. DR. THERESA TAM, CANADA'S CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER: That's 60 percent increase in risk of hospitalization, 100 percent increase in admissions to ICUs, 60 percent increase in the risk of death. And these severity indicators can be seen across all age groups of the adult population. NEWTON: British Columbia is now in a three-week circuit breaker lockdown. Variants are spreading quickly even the worrisome P-1 variant first detected in Brazil. JOHN HORGAN, PREMIER OF BRITISH COLUMBIA: Do not blow this for the rest of us. Do not blow this for your parents and your neighbors and others who have been working really, really hard making significant sacrifices. NEWTON: But that sacrifice has led to acute pandemic fatigue. Toronto has been in some form of lockdown now for more than four months. After a vaccine shortage the rollout is finally ramping up in Canada but shots won't be widely available to those under 65 for weeks yet.

Elise, now we know why the president personally authorized that drone strike to kill that Taliban leader. ELISE LABOTT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf. And Jim Sciutto just reporting from his military sources that the Taliban led by Mullah Mansour was actively planning targets against -- attacks against U.S. targets in Kabul. And this shows why the U.S. was willing to make such a bold move in striking in this tribal area of Pakistan. This is not a covert CIA strike the U.S. won't talk about, Wolf. This is a U.S. military by passing the Pakistani government, and striking in a very sensitive area. Under Mullah Mansour's leadership, we've seen a dramatic increase in violence against the U.S. and Afghan troops. He was resisting efforts to bring the Taliban to peace talks. So, the U.S. has a good intelligence, took the target of opportunity. But, Wolf, I think it's too early to know what the U.S. actually achieved by taking out the leadership. The -- you heard from the president, and he hopes this will bring the Taliban to the table. But it could have the opposite effect. We're months from a succession of Mansour's replacement, some of the names were being heard could be even more deadly, and this could lead to a splinter of the Taliban. And this also may further antagonize Pakistan, who by all accounts hasn't done enough to crack down on the Taliban but was trying to pressure the Taliban and Mansour in particular to come to the table. So, a lot of open questions about what this means for the next president about the plan withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, those peace talks and the important relationship with Pakistan, Wolf. BLITZER: The government of Pakistan, did they condemned this strike, killing Mansour. LABOTT: Well, they say what they always say, which is that this was a violation of their sovereignty, they're against the attacks. But it's kind of a muted response. And that does reflect they were also very frustrated by the Taliban's reluctance to come to the table. So, they may try to be, you know, nodding in the U.S. direction, but certainly they'll never come out and say they approved of the attack, that they knew about it beforehand. Their official line is that they didn't know anything, and this is a violation of their sovereignty. BLITZER: All right. Elise, thanks very much. Elise Labott reporting.

We're listening to officials there in Tampa, school officials, as well as police authorities, talk about how what could have been a catastrophic event was thwarted, in large part because of a citizen coming forward. And now a 17-year-old former student of a high school, Freedom High School there in Tampa, Florida, is now in custody. And also, what was seized was the makings of what could have been that catastrophic event. David Mattingly has been following this investigation for a long time, all morning long. We've been hearing little, tiny details about what police authorities might be able to say. How does this kind of complete the picture for us? What might have happened there in Tampa? DAVID MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we're finding out was that this plot had a lot of potential for a lot of harm. And we've heard that straight from the police, saying that they thwarted a potentially catastrophic event, the likes of which this city had never seen. They also indicated that this young man, a 17-year-old former student of the Hillsborough School District, saying that he had the desire to cause more casualties than Columbine. And we were told earlier by the school system that this plot was supposed to be carried out on the first day of school, which was next Tuesday. So they apprehended this young man yesterday, they found bomb- making materials inside the apartment that he was living in. They did not actually indicate in the presser that they had those bombs actually assembled, ready to go, but they say he did have the materials for making these types of explosive devices that could have done a lot of harm. So everyone breathing a huge sigh of relief right now in Tampa. WHITFIELD: Among the items that were seized, or at least located, they said shrapnel, some tubing. And also, apparently, this young man, a 17-year-old, had been arrested recently for possession of marijuana and then possible burglary as well. How have they been able to kind of locate this individual? Just one citizen? MATTINGLY: Well, they were saying he was very well known to police because he did have a criminal record, he did have a juvenile record. They had a process where they would check up on their juvenile offenders, and they have been doing that with him. They knew about him. So, apparently, when this tip came in, they were already familiar with him and ready to go right to where he lived to investigate this.

HOWELL: the last question I have for you. We understand clearly that Russia is pleased by what they saw. How important was this for President Putin? Again, who has been focused on reasserting Russian, you know, stature on the world stage. NIXEY: Yes, and you know, great job, Vladimir Putin. You have to say, he, already by getting the summit to be agreed upon in the first place, he set himself up among the American gods if you like, and he brought Russia, for 12th largest economy only in the world. On to a par. On to a level with that of the United States, and at the same time, he looked more confident, more capable and more skillful than he his opponent, so, for Russia, it has really just achieved, it's not by having a degree of content in the summit, because as far as we can tell, I am certainly judging from the press conference, there was not any but certainly and from the optics point of view, as you said is, then this is clearly a big win for Russia. HOWELL: It will be interesting looking back at this in hindsight, you know, how significance this summit was that the Russian President and the U.S. President undertook. Thank you so much. We will keep in touch with you. NIXEY: Thank you. HOWELL: President Trump has long touted the slogan America first. However his actions say differently. He slammed the U.S. allies like the European Union and the U.K., and he has embraced Russian President, just days after the U.S. indicted Russian intelligence officers.

We have the first round of arctic air that's already moved through. It retreats a little bit before returning yet again as we go into the weekend. Here's the concern with that. The good news is, it may actually help prevent lake-effect snow going forward. The first point we are about 9 percent of Lake Erie covered. By Monday, by New Year's Day, we should be at 40 percent covered. And, Pam, believe it or not, this is actually good. The more frozen Lake Erie is, the less likely those folks are to get more snow. BROWN: OK. That's good to know. But several areas have already received over 50 inches of snow. How much more is on the way? CHINCHAR: Right. So we talked about that being a good thing. The problem is that won't occur until at least Monday. We have more snow in the forecast before Monday. Take a look, widespread across areas of the Midwest and the Northeast, you're talking up to, say, about 4 inches. But notice these purple areas here, including Erie, Pennsylvania, where we could see an additional eight to 12 inches, Pam, of having some extra snow on top of what they have already had. This is an image, by the way, one of the satellite images showing all of the snow. We call them cloud streaks. You really have a hard time of seeing the lakes. Now as we said, Pam, now, you're going to be adding more snow on top of what these folks have already had. BROWN: All right. Allison Chinchar, thank you so much.

Despite the constant negative press -- what's that word? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Covfefe. NIDENTIFIED MALE: Huh? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Covfefe. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Covfefe.

More of them and the tense standoff between coalition forces and insurgents in Fallujah. CNN's Jim Clancy is standing by live in Baghdad with the latest -- Jim. JIM CLANCY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, it's not only the soldiers, it's civilians in Iraq today that are paying a high price as both casualty tolls seem to be soaring. Let's take a look now on the ground here in Baghdad. The northeastern part of the city around a place called Martyr's Monument, it was the scene of a roadside bombing today that devastated a Humvee, a U.S. military patrol was passing by. There then was an incident where, as they were trying to evacuate their wounded, a number of school schoolchildren gathered around the vehicle. They were trying to get things out of it. Others opened fire on them from rooftops, according to a coalition spokesman here in Baghdad. One Iraqi child was killed. Eight others were wounded, although police say from their hospital beds, they blamed it on the U.S. troops. Meantime, a high-level visitor, well, not just one but two of them, let me tell you about the first one. Prime Minister John Howard of Australia, a staunch supporter of the war, made a surprise visit to Baghdad this day. It is, after all, Anzac Day, a day when Australia honors its war dead as well as nose who served in the military. There are words of thanks from the prime minister, as he talked with the 850 Australian troops here, many of them serving as air-traffic controllers there at Baghdad International Airport. The opposition back at home, though, wants to bring those troops back to Australia by Christmas. In another incident, we should be looking along the front lines in Fallujah where U.S. Marines staged some search operations today, went on some patrols. They also engaged in some firefights. They say that the cease-fire hasn't looked much like a cease-fire to them. At the same time, on the negotiating level, the coalition still making earnest efforts trying to get the situation there calmed down. They want the fighters to hand in their arms. They are not doing it. In response, they're trying to get joint police patrols established and under way. That could come on Tuesday. But, Wolf, today is Sunday, and Tuesday is still a long way off.

ERICA HILL, CNN: My pleasure. CUOMO: Good, I need you this morning, there's a lot of news. Here's our starting line: President Trump defending his proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, but he is yet to say how? How doing this will help workers and how he would win a potential trade war. He's getting major push-back from trading partners and even Republican governors. Administration officials say they're leaving room for the president to change his mind, but that is of little comfort to GOP lawmakers who fear a trade war would hurt them in the mid-terms. Also, the White House is down-playing reports that the president's chief economist is planning to leave over those tariffs. All this while the fate of the president's daughter and his son-in-law remains uncertain. Their rules have been reduced, powers are limited or those indications that they're on their way out. HILL: President Trump making light of that chaos inside his administration at the annual Gridiron Dinner, taking jabs at Jared Kushner's security clearance issues and a revolving door in the West Wing. But Mr. Trump's president for life comments are raising eyebrows. And Hollywood's biggest night getting political as well. Celebrities using their moment in the spotlight to talk about harassment, protecting dreamers and gun control. But the big winners and the snubs at the Oscars -- we'll begin our coverage with Kaitlan Collins who is live at the White House. Kaitlan? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning, Erica and Chris. President Trump appears to be welcoming a potential trade deal and rebuffing those U.S. allies who have expressed concern about the potential impact of those proposed tariffs. But according to the president and his twitter feed, the United States has been on, quote, ""the losing end of trade deals for just too long.""

COLLINS (voice-over): The Trump administration defending its stiff proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum despite threats of retaliation from key American allies who will be disproportionately hurt by the policy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure, there may well be some sort of retaliation, but the amounts that they're talking about are also pretty trivial. COLLINS: White House adviser Peter Navarro telling Cnn that at this point, the president isn't planning on issuing any exemptions.

Forty-six percent approved of them, saying the ads get people talking. But do they sell? In a moment, a look at Benetton's strategy and what Madison Avenue thinks of death row. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MANN (voice-over): From the very beginning, Benetton has defied convention. It makes its clothes differently. It distributes them differently. And as you can see, it advertises them very differently. In many Benetton ads, the product seems to be an image, an attitude or an opinion. Benetton seems as eager to make an impression as a sale. (on camera): Welcome back. Benetton sells about $2 billion a year of clothing. So clearly, something is working. Joining us now to talk about the advertising is Alice Cuneo, national retail editor and West Coast bureau chief for Advertising Age. Thanks so much for being with us. Let me ask you, first of all - death row aside - about the rationale, about the thinking, about the success of all these years of all these extraordinary Benetton images. Are they selling clothes? ALICE CUNEO, ADVERTISING AGE: Well, they may be selling in other countries, but in the United States, Benetton has been struggling. It's running far, far behind The Gap, and it's become a kind of a brand that unfortunately people have referred to as one that sells poor quality clothes at high prices. So their product has not been doing very well in the United States. MANN: Any relationship there, do you think, between that problem and the latest ad campaign? CUNEO: I think it's very clear that what Benetton is doing is what magicians always try to do in their acts - have people look the wrong way at the right time. And certainly they don't want to be known for their high-priced, poor-quality clothing. Instead, have people talking about the death row issue. I don't know if it's going to sell clothes in the United States, but it certainly has generated a lot of media discussion. And their billboards and - were only shown in a couple of cities and, as you mentioned, they were in four magazines, which is a relatively limited ad campaign for this country. Yet there have been dozens of programs just like this where the media has discussed, you know, Benetton and the death issue. So they've gotten a lot of impressions at a very good price -- basically for free. MANN: It sounds like a cynical attempt not to advertise clothing or even help a cause, but to get a particular brand into the press.

2101825,2419156,CNN,The Lead With Jake Tapper,"our October polling, it's interesting to note Joe Biden down 6 percent, Elizabeth Warren down 5, Pete Buttigieg, up 5, and Bernie Sanders essentially flat. We're looking at the difference of a point there. That bump that we saw for Pete Buttigieg, he's seeing it in some early state polls. The question, of course, is, can he capitalize that 68 days now until Iowa, and can he expand it to more of the population? KRISTOL: I mean, if you step back six or nine months, though, basically, I think we all might have expected that Biden would be the front-runner, Sanders and Warren would be jostling for second. The one thing I don't know that we would have all agreed upon is that Buttigieg would really be in a pretty solid fourth place, and maybe first or second in Iowa, and maybe second or third and New Hampshire. That's impressive. And, sometimes, momentum continues. Sometimes, it stops. Howard Dean had a great 2003, and 2004 didn't work out quite for him. Still, I think that -- for me, that's the story. I mean, just step back and say, what's the story of 2019? It's Buttigieg. And that does say something, I think, about generational change. I defer to the younger people on this panel, but there's something a little crazy about three 70-year-olds jostling for the Democratic nomination. (CROSSTALK) KRISTOL: Now, maybe someone under who's not on Social Security could be the nominee against Trump. And that's why I -- I do think a lot of Buttigieg -- he's impressive personally, but I think a lot of the appeal is that. I know you... (CROSSTALK) KUCINICH: ... struggle with voters of color is real. HILL: Yes. Yes. KRISTOL: Right. KUCINICH: Latinos, African-Americans, I mean, that is a problem. And they know it. OLORUNNIPA: Yes. He is trying to be the Obama-type candidate. But he can't really put together the Obama coalition, at least not yet. He does have some support from younger voters. But when it comes to voters of color, he's really struggled to put together that broader coalition. And that would help him beyond Iowa and New Hampshire in more diverse states. And if he can't do that, he probably won't be the nominee, based on history. If he can, then he could be sort of this history-making nominee, like Obama was in 2008. FINNEY: But here's the thing. And so, when I was at the DNC, we added South Carolina and Nevada to that sort of pre-window, the early four states, specifically for this purpose, right, because we looked at how the country was changing, and wanted to make sure that, when we were nominating our nominee, finding our nominee, two states that are mostly white would not be the deciding factor.

It's just not the case. The rules have been set. They are in place. They're not going to change in these states. And they are the same -- for the next state of New York, they're all out there. Everyone knows what the rules are. I have to respond, though, if the party of which I'm the chairman of is getting attacked, especially when it's not true.

Why not -- Reince Priebus, why don't you just pick up the phone and call Trump and say, you know what, Donald, this is getting out of control? PRIEBUS: Right, and I do agree with that. And so we will do that, I'm sure, because we talk a lot. I talk with all the candidates a lot. So, we will. Wolf, this is going to blow over. This is -- I believe this is some frustration that has bubbled up, and, look, the rules are there. I know people get frustrated and they're disappointed when things don't go exactly the right way. I think when people are frustrated and upset, they say things that they regret. But certainly one thing that's true is that the rules are not being changed in order to injure or benefit anybody. They are what they are. They are in writing. They are available to anyone that wants to participate. And actually state by state, they are not all that complicated.

Because normally a front-runner like that, the party would sort of consolidate around the front-runner and move on.

See, what the Republicans want to be doing was running a national campaign against Ashley Judd, not just there in Kentucky where let's face it, Mitch McConnell is in a very strong position there. Got a lot of money. And it's a very conservative state. It was going to be an uphill battle for anybody. What Democrats were particularly worried about and what Republicans wanted to do was run against her in other red states. To sort of have the reverse of the Todd Akin effect, to try to make other people answer for what they would say were Hollywood liberals. So that's why I think Jonathan is right. The Democrats were antsy about it and perhaps not for all the same reasons. But they definitely were antsy about the candidacy. BURNETT: All right. I want to squeeze one other topic in today because I can't resist. You know, the sports moment of the day -- if you all think that I'm talking about, you know, that horrible leg incident, and you obviously aren't watching the video -- because I want to show the video of the president. You know, you know he's great at basketball, right? I mean, I probably could have made that shot. Not made it, made it as badly as he made it. This is the White House Easter Egg Roll.

But there is growing anger here at what they see, that they believe the president has done. They believe she has no power left, she's lost the trust of the people. There are growing calls for her to step down. This will only increase. Now she's being treated by prosecutors as a suspect. But there are others as well, those in political office or those experts who don't believe she will actually step down. Opposition leaders saying if she doesn't, then they will try to impeach her.

And, of course, we'll continue to update you on those two major stories today, the train derailment in India and this investigation on the South Korean president in Seoul. For now, though, let's move on to the rest of world news. Doctors say a quarter of a million people trapped in Eastern Aleppo do not have a single hospital operating at full capacity. Medecins sans Frontieres is demanding Syria stop bombing medical centers in the besieged city. At least 68 people were reported killed there on Saturday alone. It's the fifth consecutive day of renewed government airstrikes. The U.N. is asking Syria and its main ally, Russia, to greenlight their relief plan. Rebel-held neighborhoods have almost no food or medicine left. No new cabinet nominations were announced by Donald Trump on Saturday but the U.S. president-elect did hold multiple get-togethers with potential candidates for jobs in the incoming administration. Of keen interest were the arrivals of two particular individuals. There you see them, Retired Marine Corps General James Mattis, screen left, and former Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, on your right. CNN's Phil Mattingly has more on the significance of those meetings. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There was one clear meeting that everybody wanted to know everything about here in Bedminster on Saturday. That was the meeting with Mitt Romney. It wasn't so long that con man and choke artist and all sorts of insults were flying back and forth on the campaign trail. Not anymore. For an hour and 20 minutes, Mitt Romney sat down with President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Michael Pence discussing primarily foreign policy. Of course raising the question, is there a potential position in a Trump administration for Mitt Romney? Well, we haven't gotten any comment on that. But this is how Mitt Romney described their conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITT ROMNEY (R), FORMER GOVERNOR OR MASSACHUSETTS: We had a far- reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world where there are interests of the United States of real significance. We discussed those areas and exchanged our views on those topics. Very thorough and in depth discussion in the time we had.

2164906,2483229,CNN,New Day Saturday,"night. HOWARD: Getting enough sleep or better quality sleep may begin with what you sip during the day. The first step is stay hydrated. An Oxford study found a link between sleep deprivation and inadequate hydration. For women, experts recommend you drink about 11 cups of water each day, and a little more than 15 cups for men. Experts recommend before you head to bed though, try avoiding caffeine. That includes caffeinated coffees, teas, and sodas. And although a nightcap may be tempting, it may contribute to poor quality sleep. According to the Journal of Neuroscience, drinking alcohol casually or chronically may interfere with adenosine levels, a chemical in the brain that helps you sleep. Instead, try sipping warm milk. Or better yet, milk mixed with some honey, which one nutritional studies suggest as an effective and affordable way to improve your sleep. But overall it's recommended to watch your liquids close to bedtime. So, you won't have to make too many trips to the restroom while falling asleep. PAUL: So, I want to tell you that the 16-year-old who's trying to make social distancing a little more tolerable with some incredible sidewalk chalk drawings.

BOLDUAN: Do you think that once and for all, Obamacare is the future and fate of Obamacare is secure after this? MENENDEZ: Well, I have no doubt that our Republican opponents of the Affordable Care Act will continue to find ways to try to challenge it. But, you know, they've had three strikes and you're out already. It seems to me that they need to reconcile themselves that this is the law of the land. It provides health insurance for 30 million Americans, who are probably increased as people continuously need the coverage, especially in the midst of the global pandemic. I'm convinced that it will stay and as one of its authors on the Senate Finance Committee, I'm glad to see that this day has come. BOLDUAN: Senator, if we could change gears now to foreign policy as President Biden has just returned from his overseas trip, his big face to face meeting with Vladimir Putin. And the takeaway on that summit from the top Republican of the House, just came in. Kevin McCarthy, he says that Biden gave Putin a, quote, pass. He put out a statement today. Let me read what it said in part: President Biden should have used today's summit to stand up for our national interest and send a message to the world that the United States will hold Russia accountable for its long list of transgressions. Unfortunately, McCarthy says, President Biden gave Vladimir Putin a pass. Senator, what do you say to that? MENENDEZ: I think Leader McCarthy's statement is laughable. Where was he when Donald Trump stood alongside of Vladimir Putin and basically accepted all of Putin's denials about the attacks he had created, cyberattacks, election meddling he had created on the United States, and said, I believe Putin, I don't believe my own intelligence agencies? Even though there was unanimous view of all of the intelligence agencies of the United States, that Russia under Putin had tried to undermine our elections. Where was he when a lack of real sanctions on a whole host of things that Russia did? Was -- he was totally absent. And just recently, Trump said he had a good meeting with Putin in 2018. Now, I know he embraces Donald Trump. I guess he embraces the view that that meeting was a good meeting. It was not a good meeting for the United States. It was really a dark moment in our foreign affairs policy. President Biden did what needs to be done as a president. Stand up to our allies and stand up to those who wish us harm. Putin got a real clear message. And the way he acted in a press conference, was a Putin that was far less confident, far less brazen than I've seen in previous press conferences.

Live from London, our Becky Anderson is looking into a possible comeback by Michael Jackson. So a couple of questions. First of all, is he really going to follow through with this? He is going to have these 10 concerts and, number two, are people going to buy tickets? ANDERSON: Well, let's find out. We're going to have to wait and see. He is holed up in a central London hotel this hour. Ahead of what is the expected announcement that he will be back in July for 10 concerts which is promoters now hope will net him some $100 million. This is a man who hasn't been seen in public or very rarely seen in public since 2005 in the acquittal of those child molestation charges. A possible sense of excitement by the oh, so expected Motley Crue outside that hotel this morning. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can't say a comeback as he's always been around. If he go to a club every day, you can hear Michael's music. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For me, his music is amazing and despite what has happened. You know, he was acquitted of all charges so what is there to question? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I like him. I like his dances. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's the best! He is an inspiration! And there will be no one ever to touch the planet like he has. (END VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON: So why the comeback and why now? Well, he says that he wants his kids to see what old dad does. He is 51 years old this year for a day job. I think the answer should be this. He needs the money. He's hot to the tune of some of tens of millions of dollars. His Bel-Air mansion on a monthly basis cost him some 75 grand. So yes, he needs the money. It's a tough one. Will they go and buy the tickets? Who knows at this point. The O2 Arena holds 20,000 people. This is over 10 days. I'm not sure but we'll wait and see -- Kiran. CHETRY: All right. We sure will.

The fans down here in South Florida get criticized sometimes for being fair weather fans. And certainly appropriate since the weather is very nice here. People sometimes rather be outdoors than inside an arena cheering. But all of that criticism was washed away for Game 7. The fans were there. They were very loud. The excitement was so strong, really on both sides, because Game 7s are rare. There's only been five in the past 30, 35 years. So in this sport, Game 7s and NBA finals are a rare thing. And every one knew it was special from the moment the ball tipped off. LU STOUT: LeBron, I mean he had been facing a lot of questions about his performance. Do you think the ultimate win, did it shut down all the criticism? NICHOLS: You know, it's interesting with LeBron James. He's a guy who we had the same back and forth about last year. He finally won his first ring. A lot of people said this is it, this should shut down the criticism of LeBron James, but there's something about him that might be the age that we're in of social media where everybody gets to question everything instantly. It seems that his narrative is never completely written, that people are always questioning him as he goes. But he was funny about it yesterday. He said that that questioning, the constant questioning he said helped motivate him, actually was helping to drive him on. And he said keep at it. He said I need you guys. It motivates me. So I'm not sure it's ever over with LeBron, but he's certainly having fewer and fewer doubters every time he steps out on the floor. LU STOUT: Yeah, great personal insight there and about his team. I mean, the victory, it means back to back titles for the Miami Heat. What's next for them? NICHOLS: You know, they're going to really regroup here. They had this core together. This Big 3 players. And they'll have to go into next season trying to figure out if those three guys can still be the center of their team. LeBron James who is of course the guy who want to build around, then you have Dwayne Wade who has had injury problems the last two seasons. They'll have to see if he can get healthy. Chris Bosh is the third member of that group. And he's had some trouble against the bigger and more physical players they did come up against in the NBA, especially in their Eastern Conference. So I'm sure they'll take a step back, try to figure out if they need to shake things up going into next season. But for now, they're going to enjoy this.

The world lead. Could this be a piece of the missing plane? After turning up nothing for a week, the search moves 700 miles northeast, and just like that, possible debris spotted. CNN was on one of the search planes when it made what could be a big discovery. And persisting questions about the pilots' state of mind when Flight 370 veered off course. What kind of psychological screening do they have to go through, and how does it compare to the tests that American pilots take? Also, in world news, Mr. Putin, move your troops away from the Ukrainian border, so says President Obama, amid fears that Russia could start a war at any minute. Meanwhile, Putin is gloating on television about taking over Crimea. Think he got the message? Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jim Sciutto, filling in again today for Jake Tapper. And we begin again with our world lead, the search for Flight 370 in what could be a more promising phase, as we enter the fourth week since it disappeared with those 239 people on board. Soon ships will be out at sea trying to retrieve multiple objects spotted by planes after the search took a major shift to an entirely new area. We may have an idea about as to why until today the search has been fruitless, and that's because crews may have spent the last several days looking in the wrong area. But officials in charge insist they have not wasted any time or effort. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCIUTTO (voice-over): Day 21 of the search for Flight 370 began with an entirely new search area, nearly 700 miles north of the zone searchers had been scouring for more than a week. MARTIN DOLAN, AUSTRALIAN TRANSPORT SAFETY BUREAU: The new information is based on continuing analysis of radar data about the aircraft's movement between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost. SCIUTTO: Officials explained the sharp move northward follows further analysis showing the plane may not have flown as far south as previously thought. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's processing the new results, which indicate that MH370 flew at a higher speed than previously thought, which in turn means it used more fuel and could not travel as far. SCIUTTO: For days, searchers have been focusing here, raising expectations of a breakthrough with successive satellite photos showing what appeared to not just individual pieces of debris, but possible debris fields. Now satellites and planes have a new target zone, in calmer waters and closer to the Australian coast. CNN's Kyung Lah traveled aboard a U.S. P-8 Poseidon aircraft, and within minutes of arriving on sight, searchers spotted what could be debris.

We're excited about that and going to an open convention where kids are going to learn more about picking presidents than they do just on SnapChat. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, A.C. 360: You called Senator Cruz a smear artist. He's running an ad about your ties to a corporation that got tax breaks in Ohio. I saw a quote from the Ohio ethics commission saying you had made what he called a ""clean break"" from that company. Do you believe that attack is part of a broader strategy by the Cruz campaign to try to take you down? KASICH: Oh, yeah. He is Senator Smear. People seem to be pointing things out. I am not a pin cushion or marshmallow. He smeared Ben Carson. He smeared Marco Rubio. He smeared Donald Trump. Now he's smearing me. And ""the Wall Street Journal"" even pointed out that he smeared me in an editorial last week. This guy plays that kind of politics. It's down, it's dirty, it's negative and not uplifting. But that's what we deal with. And we'll put one foot in front of the other and keep going with a positive vision. But I've got to tell you, Anderson, don't push me around.

We can argue whether or not Iran is really ready for that kind of overture from the United States. But I don't think we've actually signaled that we're interested and understanding, frankly, of the way that they're signaling in their pursuit of the nuclear option. BLITZER: I want to take a quick break. But has the Bush administration, as far as you can tell, Ken Pollack, done anything to signal a willingness to deal with the Iranian government along the lines of some of the Western European countries which have actually sent high-level officials to meet with officials in Tehran? POLLACK: No, absolutely not. And it is one of the problems. And in fact, all throughout both the Afghan and Iraq wars, there were all kinds of back-channel communications, a very productive back- channel relationship where the Iranians were very helpful to the United States during the Afghan War, and also to a certain extent, during the Iraq war. In both cases there were Iranians who wanted to see if they could develop those back-channel relations into something bigger. The Bush administration turned them down. BLITZER: All right. We'll take a quick break, but we have much more to talk about with Thomas Barnett and Ken Pollack. Iran. It's a huge subject on the U.S. agenda right now. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: We're talking about what Vice President Dick Cheney calls top troublespots in the world and America's options. With me here in Washington, Ken Pollack, our CNN analyst, director of research at the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution, and in Boston, Thomas Barnett, he just wrote a very compelling article on the nuclear impasse with Iran in ""Esquire"" magazine. Thomas, I'll start again with you. Cheney yesterday said that if the U.S. and others can't get this nuclear situation resolved with the Iranians pretty soon, there's fear the Israelis might do it in their own way, presumably along the lines of what they did to the Iraqi nuclear reactor, at Osirik, back in 1981, namely launch a precision airstrike. BARNETT: Yes, and I think the Iranians have been smart enough to realize that possibility, and hence have spread those capabilities, those facilities around the country in such a way that if Israel sought to pursue that sort of option it would be much harder than just one reactor. BLITZER: Ken Pollack, as you know, Seymour Hersh in the new issue of ""The New Yorker"" says that the U.S. has already begun surveillance of what he calls 13 sites in Iran that are supposedly involved in nuclear weapons-development programs, and they've presumably got some contingency plans at the Pentagon for a so-called precision airstrike themselves?

Nick, the police have now released the video that they have of Keith Scott being shot and killed. I understand you just viewed the video, is that right? NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): I did. The video -- there's two videos, Poppy. Body cam footage and dash cam footage released by the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department. The first video is about a minute long. The second video is about two minutes long. We're currently going over it right now to try to see if there's any profanity. We want to be responsible how we show this video on CNN. But attached to this link is also a series of three photos which appears to show a Colt Mustang 380 semiautomatic handgun according to our CNN security team on the ground who also took a look at the photos. These guns are usually -- usually hold about 6 rounds, and according again to our security team here who saw those photos, very concealable, a very concealable handgun. The video is not distinctive from our vantage point just yet and cannot clearly see a gun in Mr. Scott's hands, but you do see, this is the first time we've seen police video emerge from this fatal encounter Tuesday afternoon, police shooting and killing Keith Scott, they say because he refused to comply with demands to drop a weapon. Of course, the family has said that Mr. Scott was unarmed during the shooting, but these photos released by the Mecklenburg, Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department appear to indicate the handgun that was recovered as well from the scene, a Colt Mustang 380 semiautomatic handgun found on Mr. Scott's person.

And you say that now has been shattered, the solution, with the rapid pace and the politics involved. And you don't necessarily blame her, but just the process itself, explain that and how consequential that is for the institution? GREENHOUSE: Thanks for picking up on that image. And what I meant by saying that the fourth wall was broken - so we go to theater and we know we're watching a play, that we know the people on stage are not actually experiencing the life events that they are depicting. Once in a while, an actor may deliberately 'break the fourth wall' by directly addressing the public. And so with kind of a wink, we all know this is just a play. So as you said, the fourth wall for the court has been - there's no politics here. It's just about law. But when something happen as swiftly as the accession of the three Trump justices, because don't forget Justice Gorsuch who was nominated by Donald Trump in the spring of 2017, took the seat that Mitch McConnell held open for almost a year and not allowing President Obama to fill it, so it's really the three are all of a piece in my view. And all of a sudden there we are and it's very hard to maintain that illusion, that all we're seeing is law and politics are not anywhere in view. GOLODRYGA: Well, especially because you have politicians, including President Trump himself, but Mitch McConnell and others who had alluded to just this as being the most pertinent issue as to why President Trump or Republican president in general needed to be elected in the United States, because all eyes had been on the Supreme Court in the lasting legacy beyond a one or two-term presidency. GREENHOUSE: Well, that's right. I mean, when Donald Trump was asked, ""Why are you in such a rush to fill this seat, the Ginsburg seat?"" He said, ""Well, it's going to be a close election and I want five justices. I need a full court."" And, of course, when the court did not bend to his will and didn't overturn the results of the election, which in some fantasy, he thought the court would help him out on that, he was furious and, basically, every public appearance since then he's denounced the Supreme Court 'his justices' for not doing what they were put there to do. GOLODRYGA: It's interesting you bring this up, because you also note that because of the role largely from the federal society, who have sort of vetted and presented a list of justices, that they would find appropriate and acceptable for the Supreme Court, that the question as to whether one would be surprised or not by a judge's decision, a Supreme Court judge's decision isn't that questionable actually now and",0.2372816963042527,2021-11-24

We're particularly interested in gathering both the -- to see if any body might be there of the 20th passenger or crewman. We're also looking for the cockpit voice recorder. It's very important to find that so we can begin the process of assessing that, reading it out and understanding what happened just moments before that plane crashed. (END VIDEO CLIP) SANCHEZ: And to Coast Guard Captain James Maes for more on the investigation. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAPT. JAMES MAES, U.S. COAST GUARD: This morning we will have Miami-Dade police divers will be down, taking a look at this, documenting the wreckage and continuing our look around down there. SANCHEZ: You know, interestingly enough, because I happen to be from that area and I've been there quite a bit, that's where those jetties basically create a channel, and you have some real fast-moving water that goes through there. In fact, it's kind of a treacherous place for boaters when they're first taking their boats out there. Is that pretty much where this area is? And does that create a problem for you and the divers? MAES: Oh, absolutely. It is right inside the jetties of Government Cut, which is the main ship channel. As a matter of fact, I'm the captain of the port, and one of the things we had to do yesterday was actually close that channel down for recreational and commercial traffic. We have three cruise ships that were expecting to depart yesterday afternoon between 4:00 and 5:00. We've closed the port down and the channel down indefinitely, and they're still waiting to depart sometime today. We're hoping we can reopen that channel at some point today. SANCHEZ: Captain, I know that you don't officially investigate these things, you're there to perform search and rescue. But let me ask you, from what you saw yesterday, from what you experienced, perhaps not so much as a captain, but just as a layperson who saw and was on the scene, if you see the video of this plane coming down, does it look to you like there was no doubt some type of catastrophic failure that caused this? MAES: I'm probably going to have to defer that answer to my friends with the National Transportation Safety Board. But I can tell you that we did have some of our Coast Guard homeland security cameras on Government Cut, and we did actually capture some imagery, and we provided that to the NTSB.

Seventy-nine-year-old Tariz Aziz was Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's foreign minister and deputy prime minister over two decades. He died at a hospital southern Iraq after his medical condition deteriorated in prison. Nick Paton Walsh joins me now live from Baghdad with more on possibly just one of the most public ambassadors for the Saddam Hussein regime during that dictatorship (INAUDIBLE).

He was, after all, 79. But I think many seeing the pictures of Tariz Aziz again and remembering what he did for Saddam Hussein, initially the man who said no, we will not draw our forces out of Iraq back in 1991 sparking operation Desert Storm, the first Gulf War. And the man who was occasionally a diplomat who staved off U.S. military action and fundamentally failed to, in 2003, Hala, reminds you a very different time in Iraq's history here, where arguably its problems were savage - brutal at times - but less complex than they stand today with the swirling mess of sectarian violence that seemed to be more or less unleashed by the American present (ph) of the Ba'ath Party and the Iraqi Army in the early 2000s. I think many people are still looking at this moment not because of the significance of Tariz Aziz no longer being with us, because he's not figure who registers really in Iraq's messy politics now, but simply now reminds people of how far - I think it's fair to say - Iraq has really fallen since even the repressive, tragic times of Saddam Hussein, Hala.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is not what Japan was hoping for, a scaled down ceremony, as the Olympic flame arrived at Matsushima air base. No crowds, just a few officials and two of Japan's most famous Olympians, lighting the Tokyo 2020 torch. RIPLEY (voice-over): The games are still set to begin in late July, in just over four months. Japan is hoping for a comeback, from the catastrophic earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown at Fukushima, nine years ago this month. Japan's spirit and economy desperately needed a revival. Tokyo 2020 was on track to be just that. The novel coronavirus pandemic changed everything. ""It's possible the Olympic Games will be cancelled, despite Japan's best efforts,"" says Japanese lawmaker Shigeto Shiba (ph). International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach tells ""The New York Times"" the Summer Games will not be cancelled for the first time since World War II but he now admits postponing the games is on the table. Last week, Japan's Olympic minister quickly shot down President Trump's idea to postpone the games for a year. But a recent poll says 70 percent of Japanese have doubts that the games can go on as scheduled. RIPLEY: Do you think it's going to be safe to host the Olympics in July? ""Under the circumstances, I don't think it's safe,"" says this resident. ""As an athlete, I really want to host the Olympics in Tokyo,"" this man says. ""But thinking of athletes and their families, I'm not sure it's a good idea."" Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo and Tokyo 2020 organizers say they are doing all possible to host the games on schedule. Inside Japan's Olympic Committee, signs of dissent; 1998 bronze medalist Kaori Yamaguchi told the Nikkei newspaper that the games should be postponed because athletes can't train.

MICHAEL RYAN, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: Obviously, the government (INAUDIBLE) the IOC (INAUDIBLE) will not make a decision to move ahead if there's danger to athletes, danger to spectators.

780369,1048953,CNN,Campbell Brown,"ROSKAM: Mr. President, I heard echoes today of the state senator that I served with in Springfield, and there was an attribute and a characteristic that you had that I think served you well there. You took on some very controversial subjects, death penalty reform. I -- you and I... OBAMA: We worked on it together. ROSKAM: ... negotiated on. OBAMA: Yes. ROSKAM: You took on ethics reform. You took on some big things. One of the keys was you rolled your sleeves up, you worked with the other party, and ultimately you were able to make the deal. Now, here's an observation. Over the past year, in my view, that attribute hasn't been in full bloom. And by that I mean, you've gotten the subtext of House Republicans that sincerely want to come and be a part of this national conversation toward solutions, but they have really been stiff-armed by Speaker Pelosi. Now, I know you're not in charge of that chamber, but there really is this dynamic of, frankly, being shut out. OBAMA: Well, first of all, Peter and I did work together effectively on a whole host of issues. One of our former colleagues is right now running for governor on the Republican side in Illinois. In the Republican primary, of course, they're running ads, of him saying nice things about me. Poor guy. Although, that's -- that's one of the points that I made earlier. I mean, we've got to be careful about what we say about each other sometimes because it boxes us in in ways that makes it difficult for us to work together, because our constituents start believing us. They don't know sometimes this is just politics, what you guys, you know -- or folks on my side do sometimes. So just a tone of civility instead of slash and burn would be helpful. The problem we have, sometimes, is the media that responds only to slash and burn style politics. You don't get a lot of credit if I say, you know, I think Paul Ryan is a pretty sincere guy and has a beautiful family. Nobody's going to run that in the newspapers, right? Yes. And by the way, in case he's going to get a Republican challenge, I didn't mean it. Don't want to hurt you, man. But on the specifics, I think both sides can take some blame for a sour climate on Capitol Hill. What I can do, maybe, to help is to try to bring Republican and Democratic leadership together on a more regular basis with me. That's, I think, a failure on my part, is to try to foster better communications, even if there's disagreement. And I will try to see if we can do more of that this year.

QUESTION: Joe, has the president presented any, sort of, bridging proposal, and said, here's what we think should be done, or is he just trying to facilitate an epiphany of sorts? LOCKHART: Well, I think any discussion of anything that's going on in the talks would go to substance, so I'll leave that alone. WOODRUFF: We're listening to a briefing by White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He is talking to reporters at Thurmont, Maryland, just outside Camp David, where the Middle East negotiations are under way, a summit between president -- the president of the Palestinians, Yasser Arafat, and the prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak. Just quickly to recap, Joe Lockhart not saying that there has been progress, but saying there have been serious meetings under way, ""real engagement,"" in his words, on substantive issues that the parties will need to reach agreement on. Let's go now back to Thurmont to CNN's White House correspondent Kelly Wallace -- Kelly. KELLY WALLACE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Judy, you probably sense a little frustration from reporters who are grasping for any little bit of information, any details of what's going on behind closed doors. We are operating here in a virtual news blackout. All sides have agreed on a news blackout, trying to keep all the options being discussed behind closed reporters, and so not for reporters. But a couple of Developments today that Joe Lockhart did comment on. One, Palestinian sources are telling CNN that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is calling for a meeting of the Palestinian leadership to be held Thursday at the presidential retreat at Camp David. Joe Lockhart was asked about that. He said that there has been no request from the Palestinians for such a meeting to take place. He said that no one in the administration has been informed about such a meeting, but there's restricted access to Camp David, so that they would have to get a request for any additional personnel to go into the retreat: again saying no request so far from the Palestinians for that meeting. Another development today, Israel announcing that it has decided to hold off on its controversial sale of an advanced airborne warning system to China. Joe Lockhart was commenting that the administration was satisfied with Israel's decision, even though it's not clear if that decision is just a suspension or if Israel has said it will never go forward with such a sale. Israel sources telling CNN that Israel believed that such a deal, which is very controversial in the U.S. Congress, that this deal would basically jeopardize any U.S. assistance for any future Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. As you mentioned, Joe Lockhart did say there's real engagement on the substantive issues, but he did mention that he's not aware of any meeting today between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

HAMMER: Montag says she`s happy with her surgery and proud of it, but not every young star flaunts it. Talk about young. Twenty-three-year-old pop star Ashley Simpson kept the rumor mill busy when she turned up on the head carpet with a decidedly smaller nose. Let`s face it. Her nose has before and after written all over it. Turns out, it`s true. Her dad, Joe Simpson, spilled the beans recently, but said she had it done for health reasons. OK. We can understand that, Ashley. But what about this? Botox at 23? That`s what ""In Touch Weekly"" claims about her. They say Ashley gets injections once a month to give her that wide eyed look. But SHOWBIZ TONIGHT asked one of the leading plastic surgeons in Hollywood if he thinks the Botox rumors are true. He tells us, he doesn`t buy it. ALESSI: Somebody who`s 23 or 24 years old is very, very unlikely that they would actually need Botox. It would be unlikely that she would have the type of wrinkles that you would see that would be indicative for Botox. HAMMER: We`ll leave that one to the unsolved mystery files. But you`ve got to admit, there are some celebrities out there who have had work done. And yes, it is a no-brainer. Like, for example, Ashley`s big sis, 27-year- old Jessica Simpson. Get a load of those lips. Yes, that`s Jessica Simpson with collagen injection. She admitted to having the lip job and said she hated it once she got it. She told ""Glamour"" magazine, quote, ""It looked fake to me. I didn`t like that. But it went away in like four months. My lips are back to what they were. Thank god!"" Thank god is right. Actually, when you think about it, she got the lips done in a pretty traumatic time in her life, not long after the split with her hubby Nick Lachey. So did another starlet, 25-year-old Britney Spears. ALESSI: It`s well-known that she had her lips augmented recently. And here, you have somebody who`s out of shape, whose career is failing. She has her - custody of her children is well-known. And she goes in to her lips augmented. HAMMER: I know, right? So why`d she do it, Doc? Was she looking for a quick fix?

It's the gravity and the seriousness here, it is existential? FREAKLEY: Well, they are. So let's take the automotive industry for instance. What's happening with autonomous vehicles, what's happening with electric vehicles is the investment required to position an enterprise to survive in that environment is very significant. So you see, you know, the proposed mergers that are being discussed. That's really all about aggregate investments and focus to survive in a rapidly changing world. QUEST: Good to see you, sir.

Therefore, a lot of countries especially developed countries depend heavily on Chinese rare earth imports.

The children even tried to send a hand-written note to the Chinese authorities, formally requesting to join their parents in Italy, who have secured Italian visas for them. Their case has caught international attention since our story aired and was brought up in Italy's parliament, where the foreign affairs undersecretary said the government is working to help the family. Italian officials have been debating a resolution on condemning human rights violations in Xinjiang and following the U.S. and other countries in labelling China's actions as genocide.

ANDERSON: Matthew in Moscow, Russia's foreign minister calling the story wild. Explain. MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, he did. He said it was wild. He said basically that this was exaggerated and he couldn't believe that it had been exaggerated so much. He said that this was certain people making an elephant out of a fly. And so, it is like a mountain out of a molehill. He was speaking in a Russian idiom. And so, yes, this fits in with the sort of category of responses that we've heard from Russian officials all along, which is that this whole scandal about this whole allegation, about the Russians meddling in the U.S. election, about collusion between Russians and Trump officials is made up and has an agenda of discrediting both Russia and Donald Trump as president. And that's been going on again today, saying -- the Kremlin also issued a statement today, saying this is like being on a TV show that drags on for too long. And so, they are using the most colorful language that they can to try to distant themselves from the scandal and to discredit it. ANDERSON: All right. We were hoping to hear from Lavrov here, but perhaps we won't. So I'll leave it there for the time being. This Russia controversy is far from over. Matthew, thank you. In fact, the president's pick to head the FBI is facing questions about it. He is testifying now at a senate confirmation hearing.

CNN's political director David Chalian joins us now from New York. You and I spoke at this time yesterday when these e-mails had just been released on Twitter by Donald, Jr. As you reflect on the past 24 hours and what we've learned, your thoughts? DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Well, I think the most important thing that we learned from the e-mails that Donald Trump, Jr., posted was that the meeting was clearly framed for Donald Trump, Jr., and for Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort -- we'll get to that in one second, as a meeting with somebody who was part of the Russian government's effort to help his dad's campaign. Therefore, this was a willingness on Donald Trump, Jr.'s part to attend a meeting with the understanding that this was part of the effort of Russia to meddle in the U.S. election. I mean, that's simple. That's in black and white. So the notion that has been dismissed for months by Donald Trump and his closest allies, that there's nothing to this whole thing, whatsoever, it's a pure fake thing, fabricated by the Democrats and the press. That's been put to rest by anybody who is just looking at the facts. There is at least something to the notion",0.1262650602409638,2017-07-12

PAUL: Talk to me about the light, because as I understand it you designed this in such a way that there is light at specific times going to specific places in the building. How did you do that? CALATRAVA: Yes.

And unfortunately, a lot of the Republicans, like it or not, they were coordinated and looped in as Trump candidates, whether they tried to or not. And the more they embraced the Trump policies, as we can see, the more it hurt them. And in this area, and largely throughout California, the surge of immigrants has really impacted the voting patterns. As we see more Hispanics and Latinos come, those votes generally go more Democrat. It's incumbent upon Republicans in California and across the country in these Congressional districts to realize it's about policies and curtailing your campaign message to exactly what the voters in your area want. BOLDUAN: I want to ask about the fight for the speaker's gavel, Joe. There are now 18 Democrats who have said they will oppose Nancy Pelosi for speaker. But every day that goes by without an actual challenger against Nancy Pelosi for the speaker's gavel, does this -- is this anything more than a statement of protest then? If there's no one to challenge her -- LOCKHART: It's not a serious challenge, like an election where you can choose between one candidate and another. They're trying to work, I think, use the leverage of the speaker's election to change some of the rules, to gain more influence. On one level, this makes a lot of sense. The Democratic leadership has to get younger and more diverse. But what the Democrats need most now is a steady hand to make sure that the next two years go well. And that's why there isn't someone stepping out. You know, I just -- I also think if you look at this election and you look at over 100 women getting elected, for a bunch of kind of back-bench male Democrats to come out and criticize Nancy Pelosi while not being willing to step out themselves -- (CROSSTALK) BOLDUAN: Step up and run. LOCKHART: -- it's a little ridiculous. They're also putting a lot of these swing state Congressional district incoming freshman in a tough spot. The first two years -- (CROSSTALK) BOLDUAN: Yes, I keep inviting them on to ask that question. LOCKHART: You know, at the end of the day, there's a solution, which is she only has to get a majority of the people voting yea or nay. BOLDUAN: Yes. LOCKHART: You can stay true to the fact I'm not supporting her by voting present. I think that's what's going to happen.

I mean I think we have to realize Iran has a specific industry -- Shia religion, the role of the mullahs in Iran, going back to the 19th century. I mean there is so many different things between a Sunni country and a Shia country, between Iran, which is not an Arab country, and Egypt.. The second thing is part of that is an effect of the United States pushing on Iran back since 1953 when we overthrew a democratic regime there. SPITZER: No question about it there are -- but the United States is not the first country to lack the subtlety of understandings and nuance to appreciate what was going on within Egypt or any of the Middle Eastern states. KHALIDI: It's partly because neither our government nor -- with all due respect -- our media really listens to experts. There are experts in our government. There are experts in our universities. Thank god you guys are bringing people -- I'm not talking about myself. SPITZER: Because we'll have you back on a regular basis. KHALIDI: Day in, day out, on TV, I'm seeing voices and faces I have never seen, instead of the same people who comment on every single thing and know nothing about anything. SPITZER: Well, look, Professor, if nothing else, we now know that those responders three weeks ago clearly did not understand what was going on. KHALIDI: They certainly didn't. SPITZER: Nor was the president getting terribly getting good advice. Let's switch gears. KHALIDI: I'm afraid he may not be even now. SPITZER: Well, that maybe we'll get to if we have time. Let's go to the street in Egypt. Who can emerge as a leader? I mean the problem with a leader -- the beautiful thing about a leader in this revolution is it's organic, it's real. The problem is who then negotiates for it to move the ball forward? KHALIDI: You have a point there. And I saw Ben's piece, and he's right. It's not clear who's going to be the leader of this. But I can tell you a couple of things. There are unions and women's groups that have leaders. There are youth groups that have leaders. The people who organized this are leaders. Six of them came out the other day. I saw them in a-- in a little piece on YouTube. So there are leaders there. The question is do we want multibillionaire businessmen like Sawiris to be the leaders? Do we want a general who's tortured and done thing that make him quite unpopular in Israel -- sorry, in Egypt -- as the leader? Or are we going to let this movement throw up its own leaders?

Before that happens, obviously, they got to finish counting the votes. And that's going to happen over the next couple of weeks. And then the government -- well, they're beginning to form the government under their new constitution. It takes a two-third vote of the parliament for certain top officials to assume office. And to form this inclusive government, the Iraqi leaders must compromise and negotiate and build consensus, and this is going to take some time. What the American people will see during the weeks ahead is a political process unfolding; that people will be making decisions not based upon who's got the biggest gun but who's got the capacity to rally the will of the people. And that's positive. Democracies are an important part of our winning the war on terror. Democracies yield an ideology that is based on an ideology that says, ""People are free, free to choose."" The ideology of the enemy says, ""A few people will chose and if you don't like what we tell you to believe in, we'll kill you or treat you harshly."" And I want the American people to remember what life was like for the poor people in Afghanistan under the Taliban. The Taliban had no hopeful vision. Their vision was, ""If you don't agree with us, we'll take you in the public square and whip you."" Their vision was, ""Women don't have rights."" Their vision was a dark and dim vision which stands in stark contrast to the vision based upon freedom and democracy. The second part of our strategy is to -- in Iraq, a strategy for victory is to train the Iraqis so they can take the fight against the few who would stop the progress of many. And during this election, we were briefed about the security forces during the election. The commanders talked about more than 215,000 Iraqi soldiers and police that secured the country. That was an increase, by the way, of 85,000 since January 2005. General Casey labeled the performance of the troops as superb. BUSH: Before the elections, there was a number of joint operations to lay the groundwork for a peaceful election. The Iraqis were in the lead on election day. In other words, they were responsible for the security of the elections. We were in a position to help them but they were responsible for securing the voting booths. And they did a fine job. The number of attacks during the election were down dramatically. They performed. And that's part of our calibrating whether or not the Iraqi troops are becoming more capable. Numbers are one thing but the ability to perform is another. And during these elections, the Iraqi troops showed our commanders on the ground and showed the American people that they're becoming more and more capable of performing their duty to provide security to the Iraqi people.",0.0245322199502895,2006-01-04

JIM JOHNSON, DEMOGRAPHER: The new immigrants are phenotypically different. They are, for the most part, people of color who cannot change that reality. HOCHMUTH: Perhaps no one understands those tensions better than Jim Johnson, a demographer who studies population trends for the University of North Carolina. J. JOHNSON: The South is dramatically changing and we're not handling it too well right now. That has been pretty unsettling to people. There's -- I think it's safe to say there's been a nativist backlash to the influx. HOCHMUTH: His best example is Siler City in nearby Chatham County. Until about five years ago, it was a quiet town of about 5,500. Since then, an estimated 3,000 Hispanic immigrants, mostly from Latin America and other parts of the U.S., have moved in. J. JOHNSON: No one likes change. I mean, you know, Chatham County and to a certain extent North Caroline for years was kind of a sleepy backwater. No one likes change, and particularly at the rate at which this change has occurred. I mean, it kind of hit us upside the head without, you know, any forewarning. HOCHMUTH: Most Hispanics are drawn to the area by jobs at two poultry processing plants; jobs that pay about $7 per hour. Many earn more in a day here than in two weeks or more back home. Although these workers and their paychecks have helped revive an otherwise declining downtown, immigrants have not always felt welcome here. LLANA DUBESTER, HISPANIC LIAISON, SILER CITY, NORTH CAROLINA: I think Siler City is a town that is happy with the way it was, and it's no longer what it was 10 years ago even. HOCHMUTH: One big sore spot for longtime residents has been Siler City Elementary School. Just seven years ago, most of the students were white with a small black minority. Today, nearly half are Hispanic and less than 20 percent are white as immigrants have moved in and other parents have pulled their children out. Off camera, they charge their children were getting less attention as teachers' time was taken up dealing with students who couldn't speak English. The school's principal says that's just not true, and that the real problem is simply fear. RANDY JOHNSON, PRINCIPAL: Sometimes, you know, we're afraid of the unknown.

We see as the single most important criteria for minority children. We see education. We see a future where, once again, America has the highest percentage of college graduates in the world, a future where school graduation rates of high school are not a matter of what neighborhood you feel like, what your background are your parents, what your economic circumstances are. A future where everyone has access to education beyond high school because six out of ten jobs in the coming decade are going to require more than a high school diploma. A future where everyone can find a decent job where quality early education is available to our children, increasing exponentially the chances they will succeed in school, where class sizes are small so kids can get personalized attention they need, where we demand more of our teachers and we treat them like they are, professionals, high standards and pay equal to other professions. Look, education doesn't play a central role in the Romney- Republican vision of the future of America. It's on the back burner. It's not a priority. You doubt me, just look at their budget for the future, massive cuts in early education. The one thing all educators agree on is the central, most important initiative to deal right upfront, right upfront with the achievement gap, elimination of the tuition tax credit for families, cuts in Pell Grant scholarships for children of low-income families, cuts in Title I funding for lowest performing schools, cuts of $2.7 billion, cuts in special education funding. In my view, backing away from the proposition that we've held for years and years that children should be educated to the degree to which they are educable. Cuts by $2.2 billion, cuts in job training, just listen to what they say, what he says. He says the effort to reduce classroom size may actually hurt education more than it helps. Tell that to all of those private schools. Tell that to all of those parents. Energy, we envision a future where clean, renewable energy represents an increasingly large share of energy consumed in America, an America that is energy-independent. We see a nation that breathes cleaner air, where our cities are not polluted, where asthma doesn't claim the lives of African-American children four times as great as it does to all other children because of the environment in which they live. Romney sees a different energy future, where renewable energy, wind, solar, biofuels, they are not a priority. Where Romney's",0.299756335282651,2012-07-12

We see and there are storm surges could send flooding as far inland as Houston. How far could the damage spread and how bad it will be as it moves away from the coast. GIBEAUT: Well, the damage will depend on the developments that it intersects. And it could extend tens of miles in some places because it's a very low-lying, gentle gradient landward.

Behind me is the Gulf of Mexico. Nearby the sea, it is relatively calm. It is actually a beautiful day here in Galveston. All that, of course, is going to change very soon. Somewhere over the horizon is Hurricane Rita. The most destructive hurricane possible, a Category 5. And it is expected to make landfall here or very close to here by Saturday, early Saturday morning. Here's what's happening at this moment. The White House has declared states of emergencies for here in Texas and Louisiana. Mandatory evacuations are underway in Galveston right now, as well as Corpus Christi and areas near Houston. Texas is trying to find room for those fleeing Rita. The states homeland security director said there are plans for 250,000 people to be given shelters, but if needed, he says Texas can house half a million evacuees. And a grim statistic from Hurricane Katrina. Today, the death toll climbed past 1,000. We knew it was going to happen. It is still a horrible thing to actually have to report. The number of confirmed fatalities from Katrina now stands at 1,033. Before Sunday, Rita only existed as a big what if on weather service computer model. Too terrible for people to even really think about. And two days ago it was real, it became real, a menacing tropical storm.

However, last night they seemed to try to be appealing to Democrats in many ways in some of their positions. We saw William Weld go out there and say he would support Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.

200566,350570,CNN,CNN Live At Daybreak,"CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: So, what do you want for Christmas? Jewelry? TiVo? Maybe a new Lexus? Don't you hate those commercials? Well, no one wants a few extra pounds, I do know that. But how do you stay slim for the holidays? Our favorite nutritionist Lisa Drayer live in New York with some holiday help to keep us slim for 2004. OK, hit us. LISA DRAYER, NUTRITIONIST: Right. That's right, Carol, the key is to stay slim now. Don't wait till new year's. And it's not that difficult, but a few tips to keep in mind. The first is keep a food journal. Do you know research shows that those who write down what they eat specifically during the holiday season end up losing weight during this time, whereas those who don't write down what they eat end up gaining weight. Now, this is not to say that you should whip out your pocket notebook at your next holiday party, but if you can at least do this on days when you're not out celebrating, you can avoid weight gain. Also, walk briskly in the malls. This is a great way to multitask, you know, combine your shopping and your exercise. And just to give you an idea of how effective this can be, over a 30 minute period, if you're walking at a pace of three miles per hour, that's between a leisurely stroll and a very brisk walk, you can burn off the equivalent of six mini candy canes. And, also, keep snacks handy, whether it's bananas, pretzels or even energy bars. That's going to help you to avoid temptation at the mall food courts when you're shopping and, of course, at the office. COSTELLO: Good idea. So what if you're going to that big holiday party, though, Lisa? DRAYER: Right. There are some other tips to keep in mind that are specific to the party. The first is make sure you eat before you go. You don't want to starve, you're more likely to overeat later on. Also, wear a belt or tight fitted clothes. You're more likely to feel it. But you are more likely to feel it when you've had enough to eat. Focus on talking not eating. Make your party centered around the people, not necessarily the food. Also, pick one dessert. You don't need to deprive yourself, but pick the one you really want to have and limit it at that. And watch the alcohol. Alcoholic holiday beverages can be very caloric. I have the calorie count here. It's about 270 calories for a four ounce eggnog with one jigger of rum. COSTELLO: Wooh! DRAYER: So be careful. COSTELLO: Well, having said all of this, I've often wondered how much weight do people gain, on the average, every holiday season? DRAYER: Well, here's the good news, Carol, it may not be that much. A recent study published in the ""New England Journal of Medicine"" actually found that the average weight gain between",0.0382862035451474,2003-12-11
1383450,1697851,CNN,New Day Saturday,"on notice. This is not the first rodeo -- Sony has of course been hacked before. And that's one of the issues here, Victor. In as much as the lawyers are saying you were on notice, you therefore had an obligation being on notice of being hacked before, that there were problems in your security system. And at the very least, based upon you being on notice of those problems you should have took the adequate precautions to ensure that this information is safe. In fact, in one of the allegations in the complaint they say you made a business decision knowing of this risk but not wanting to invest the time, attention and money to it. And as a result of that, it causes a serious problem. So I think Sony knows it's on the hook here and I don't think they want protracted litigation. They don't want to be in court. They want to resolve this, make good with their former employees, give the employees the protections they need in terms of the credit monitoring, and move forward insuring or at least attempting to insure that this doesn't happen in the future. BLACKWELL: And Joey, Sony is now threatening to sue news agencies that published what was released by these hackers. How do you gauge the potential strength of a claim like that? Now, that Victor, I believe that to be problematic. Why -- because the Supreme Court really has ruled on this issue. And, you know, not so much this issue itself, in terms of somebody hacking information and then what you do as far as republishing that information. But we know that the general tenor, right, the general approach of our court is free and unbridled communication. And to matters of public interest, you know, the media's not doing anything but republishing something that was stolen by someone else. So is there an ethical duty perhaps on the media, that you can make the argument. But a moral duty is one thing; a legal duty not to do something is quite different. So to the extent that you say legally you can't publish that, I think that's a very problematic argument to make. BLACKWELL: All right. HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson, we appreciate your insight. JACKSON: Thank you -- Victor. Tell Suzanne ""hello"" for me. BLACKWELL: I'll let you do it yourself. JACKSON: Hi, Suzanne. MALVEAUX: Hi Joey. JACKSON: Good to see you. MALVEAUX: Good to see you.

We'll bring you updates as we get them. Meantime, breaking news in the world of politics. Ted Cruz has a secret, a secret in what he is calling a major announcement at 4:00. A combination that can only mean one thing, the problem is we don't know what thing is. There's speculation he might announce a running mate. This would be unprecedented this far before the convention. BOLDUAN: Not to mention from a candidate who is not actually winning, not the front runner, or all of this could be an endorsement, but maybe a big endorsement.

SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kate, like you said, we are hearing he did a big announcement but it is still a secret. The Cruz campaign is very mum on what the announcement is. Clearly they are trying to make moves here to try to re-focus attention on their campaign after that bruising defeat last night. Senator Cruz coming out in a big way at this diner saying there will be -- making an announcement that there will be an announcement later today at 4:00 p. m. eastern time in Indianapolis. That is around the time that Donald Trump will be in town just six miles away from that rally. So clearly trying to regain control of the narrative around his campaign and hype it as much as he can. Of course, there is a lot of speculation, will this be a vice presidential pick from Senator Cruz and asked him repeatedly this morning, have you made a decision on your voice presidential pick and running mate?

NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: We should replace bilingual education with immersion in English so people learn the common language of the country and so they learn the language of prosperity not the language of living in a ghetto. We should establish... FRANKEN: The phrase language of the ghetto was vintage Gingrich, and so was the outraged response to it. CHRISTINE NEUMANN-ORTIZ, VOCES DE LA FRONTERA: Three words came into my mind. Ignorance, eliticism (ph), and racism. FRANKEN: Mr. Gingrich's office declined to comment on whether the line was part of his prepared speech. GINGRICH: The elites in the city will go crazy. They'll say you're not allowed to talk about that. Well, we just did. FRANKEN: If Gingrich does run for president, he might have to find support somewhere besides any block of Hispanic voters. ROSA ROSALES, LULAC: It was just very offensive and I would say to him that I heard he might run for president. That if he expects any kind of support from the Latino community in the United States that he needs to do much better. FRANKEN: Many Republicans including President Bush have pushed hard to win over Latino voters. In 2004, George W. Bush won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. Last year's street demonstrations showed that supporters of immigration can turn out high numbers.

And so I am committed to the spread of liberty. It's, after all, how we were founded. And there's a debate here in the United States that says, ""Well, maybe it's too much for the United States to insist that others live in a free world. Maybe that's just too unilateral."" I view that as cultural elitism for people to say that. It's like saying, ""We're OK to be free, but you're not."" I believe freedom is universal.

For Michael Cohen, he is in potentially a lot of trouble and he will presumably be looking for a way to try to be valuable to investigators. He is thinking about his own family, about himself and whether or not he is facing jail time. BALDWIN: So, to my lawyers, the key piece that Michael Cohen says is that when Trump came into this knowledge about the Trump tower meeting, that there were other people in the room. There's no audio recording of this conversation. So, in terms of evidence, how does Cohen prove that? JOSEPH MORENO, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I will take that one. Sure. Corroboration. Can these people corroborate what Michael Cohen is saying? BALDWIN: The other people in the room. MORENO: Right. Who are they? What would they say under oath will they back him or the president? Who are they? There's unlikely to be any other contemporaneous evidence. Probably no other evidence, no recording. So, it comes down to the credibility of these other people. BALDWIN: Do you think Mueller already talked to the other people in the room? CAROLINE POLISI, federal and white collar criminal defense attorney: I do. I think Mueller, as in everything in this case, Mueller knows a lot more than we do. The implication of Giuliani last night said he is pretty sure the other witnesses in that room would testify to the fact that this did not happen in the way that Michael Cohen is saying it happened. That's where you get into Michael Cohen's motivations. He has a dog in this fight. A classic tried and true technique on the part of criminal defense attorneys to try to draw out the underlying motivation of a cooperating witness. Well, Michael Cohen doesn't want to go to jail. So maybe he is making it up. BALDWIN: Good enough motivation. There are three signs, Josh Campbell, that it is Michael Cohen who is telling the truth so let me just explain this to everyone. One, that Trump teased that he would be giving a speech on Hillary Clinton's misdeeds. He is saying, did you see all the Hillary stuff that she's been doing? I'm going on expose it. That never happened. When he threatened it, it happened to be the same day that Trump Jr. accepted this Trump Tower meeting. We also know about before and after the Trump Tower meeting, we know about Don Jr. placed a number of calls to a blocked phone number.

What were the organizational factors that may have influenced one way or the other this event and its outcome? What was the overall regulatory compliance history of Columbia Gas. (END VIDEO CLIP) KOSIK: Now, state and local authorities are also carrying out their own investigations. As for the NTSB, they say they will come up with their findings, anywhere between 12 and 24 months. But they do say, the NTSB does say they will come out with a preliminary report that could spell out that probable cause, the reason, also -- for these explosions that killed one and injured more than 12 and damaged or destroyed dozens of homes and businesses. Ana? CABRERA: It's such a scary situation, Alison. If I were one of those thousands of people who had to evacuate, I would be scared to go back home, not knowing what the cause is at this point. How do they know people are safe to go home? What is being done to make sure that those homes are safe? KOSIK: Well, right now what's actually happening in the neighborhoods, you've got these teams of three sort of going literally door to door in the three suburbs to these homes. It's a utility technician, a first responder, and a locksmith. And they're literally going inside the home and checking to see if there's any lingering gas, let's say in the attic or the basement. And they're shutting off the gas. Also, outside they're noticing if there's any lingering gas there. So, each time the home maybe gets a clean bill of health, then perhaps people can go back home. But here's the thing, when they go back home, there's no power right now and there's no gas. No telling when the power is going to come back on. And I'm hearing that it will take weeks before the gas is turned back on. Ana? CABRERA: All right. Alison Kosik, thank you for that update. Demonstrators rally on the streets of Dallas protesting the police shooting death of a black man in his own home by a police officer. We have the latest in this case just ahead, a CNN exclusive, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CABRERA: A Texas family is demanding answers after a man was shot by a Dallas police officer who says she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Botham Jean was laid to rest yesterday and an attorney for his family is now casting doubt on the official story. The police officer who pulled the trigger says she thought she was entering her own home and opened fire on who she thought was an intruder. CNN's Ryan Young has more on this and goes inside the victim's apartment to see himself what happened. Here is his report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RYAN YOUNG (voice-over): Unit 1478 was Botham Jean's apartment. It's where the 26-year-old's",0.0827478777663913,2018-09-15

PORTER: Absolutely not. Look, Democrats are delivering this infrastructure package, along with President Biden. And we're so glad that Republicans are stepping up, and recognizing that this kind of investment, in infrastructure, is what we need, to have a strong and stable globally competitive economy. But to say that we're going to support infrastructure is also to say that we're going to support the workers, who are going to be building those bridges, working on those transit jobs, engaging in those climate projects. And that means that we also need to be doing things, like investing in childcare, passing paid family leave. These are both parts of the ""Build Back Better"" plan. And Democrats are simply saying, ""We're with you President Biden. We're going to do both of these things, absolutely with you."" And we hope Republicans will join in the second part of the plan that both of the aspects of this can be bipartisan. CUOMO: What if you can't get the full number of Democrats, in the Senate, with the reconciliation part, which, you know, I agree with your analysis about the need to help workers. I'm just saying let's call it non-traditional infrastructure. I know that that's a little objectionable, to progressives. But forgive me on it, at least for now, because there are people who don't agree. But let's say they don't want to do it in the Senate. Then it comes back to you guys. And it is, will you pass the part that they agree on that Biden is celebrating, and leave the other part alone? PORTER: We are - there's absolutely a necessity that we don't leave any Americans behind in this economic recovery. And so, that means we have to be thinking, not just about jobs, on climate resilience, but also about caregiving jobs. It means we have to not just be investing in airports, but we have to be investing in things, like childcare. CUOMO: But isn't something better than nothing? And would you kill the first bill, if you can't get the second one? PORTER: This is a false choice. We, the Democrats, have control of the House. We have 50 votes in the Senate. And this is ultimately, Chris, up to the American people. And the American people want us to create good high-paying jobs. They also want us to support them, in being able to train, and travel to, and take care of their family, and put away enough money to take care of themselves. CUOMO: But you have sticker shock with some of your Democrats in the Senate, as you know. PORTER: Well, it's really important to talk through what we're going to be investing in, and what the cost is of doing nothing. It's also important to understand President Biden has put very real proposals, on the table, to help",0.4343345481965565,2021-06-29

But we were told that the driver of this vehicle, as of probably 20 minutes ago or so, was trapped. And that they were trying to get him out. We are trying to get the information as to whether that driver is still in here or not. I can probably walk out a little bit and get a little closer. Not sure how the state police are going to react to this but we'll see. A lot of traffic problems in the D.C. area as this sleet, freezing rain and snowfall continues to pound this area. A lot of road closures here in Maryland. We were in Virginia a short time ago when we helped a gentleman who had done a 180 off the road. He hooked up his vehicle to a cord. Hooked it up to our vehicle, pulled him out of there. A lot of road closures in this area. A lot of traffic problems. The federal government is closed today. So that has cut down on a lot of the traffic. So that's a fortunate thing. The unfortunate thing is you've got a very slippery surface here on the roads. A lot of slush. A lot of ice. And here comes state police over here. I am not sure if this is still an active rescue -- Carol. COSTELLO: All right. We're going to let you go because your shot is freezing on the air. Some irony there. But please be careful, Brian Todd. Please stay off the roads today. It's just not worth it. Stay off the roads. Let's head to New York City now and Central Park. It is snowing like mad there. Let's check in with Indra Petersons. Hi, Indra. INDRA PETERSONS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: That is -- good morning, Carol. That is an understatement. We're talking about flakes now that are so big that one of these really felt like someone just threw a snowball right into my eye. I mean, they're unbelievably, impressively huge. Snowfall now coming down near blizzard-like conditions out here. Two if not four inches per hour. That is how heavy this snow is falling. You can actually see just to my right here, we have residents trying to kind of shovel out early and get ahead of the storm. They're saying they're going to come out every hour because that's what it's going to take when you have a heavy snowfall range like this. What are we expecting now as we go throughout the day? Two things. Remember, we still have ice in the southeast. We see half an inch to an inch of ice in the southeast. A crippling ice storm. And unfortunately, more ice is still on the way into the southeast. Then the second part of the system is this heavy snow.

LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well there's still the investigation, Brooke, which we have yet to see the results of that investigation that is ongoing. And so, if there is a determination that these allegations are founded and it could potentially also lead to prosecution, which is something that President Joe Biden said. That if that investigation finds that these are legitimate accusations, that it could eventually result in prosecution. But Cuomo is pretty much invoking a strategy that was invoked by Donald Trump. He's also using one that was used by Governor Ralph Northam in Virginia, which is that if he feels he has the support of the public -- and right now Cuomo feels he does -- that he pretty much is resisting all calls for his resignation and saying that he's staying put and he's not moving anywhere. BALDWIN: And did Ralph Northam stay in office? Yes, he did. Charlie, we'll come back to Cuomo in a second, but to Tom Reed. You know, the details, I mentioned them off the top, reportedly putting his hand outside this woman's blouse, unhooking her bra, moving his hand, you know, up her thigh. She has accepted the Congressman's apology, but do you think he should still have a job? CHARLIE DENT, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, first, let me say, I know Tom Reed well. He's a friend, I served with him. He acknowledged a drinking problem. He accepted responsibility for his actions. I suspect what will happen is that he will be entitled to due process. There could be some type of an investigation, perhaps by the ethics committee or some other group within the House to investigate exactly what happened. So I think we should let that play out. But the fact that he has accepted responsibility and has apologized should carry some weight. And he's also ending his own political career, acknowledging that he will not seek other office. This office or any other office in the next cycle. So, it's a very different case than Governor Cuomo, as far as I'm concerned. BALDWIN: There is, just Charlie staying with you, you know, a huge number of both Democrats and Republicans who are calling for Governor Cuomo to resign. and agree, these are two very different cases. But we are not hearing from any notable Republicans calling for Reed to step down. Do you think that the reason why is they agree with you and they believe he's just said he won't run again, he's mea culpa and that's the end of the story? DENT: Well, I would say that the -- well let me say, Brooke, I think most members -- I was chair of the ethics committee. And I always said, look, we have to investigate before we ask people to step down. That was always my view. That he was entitled to due process. I",0.1700536084879295,2021-03-22

And yes, other people knew him for his dirty humor and for his standup and for his role on ""Entourage."" But like I said before, ""Fuller House,"" the show that ran on Netflix from 2016 to 2020 reintroduced Bob Saget to an entire new generation. People who grew up watching him, now their children were watching Bob Saget. And so I think that like Bill was saying, there's not many stars and actors who can claim that. And that's why this one cuts so deep. MATTINGLY: There's no question about it. Before I get to Bill and Brian, I want to bring in some sound. Bob Saget explaining how he got his iconic role as Danny Tanner on ""Full House"" by accident. Take a listen to what he told our Jake Tapper just last year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOB SAGET, ACTOR/COMEDIAN: I was doing audience warm-up for ""Bosom Buddies"" as a comedian when I lived in L.A.. trying to get my career going, and then ""Full House"" was an accident. I got fired from a job on CBS and was asked to be in ""Full House,"" I wasn't available, and then I got to the show. And it was made by the producers of ""Happy Days,"" which was another show. It was Tom Miller and Bob Boyet. And they made ""Happy Days,"" ""Laverne and Shirley,"" all of these classic sitcoms. And so I was kind of the Richie Cunningham on ""Full House"" and Stamos was Fonzie and Dave was Ralph or Potsie. (END OF VIDEO CLIP) MATTINGLY: I feel like there's so many of those stories. Brian, you know, we don't have a ton of detail about Bob Saget's death. We have a tweet from law enforcement. You've mentioned, though, he was on tour, I believe he had a performance last night or two nights ago. STELTER: Yes. MATTINGLY: What do you know about that right now? STELTER: That's right, and after his performance in Jacksonville, Florida, at 3:45 in the morning, here's what he posted to his fans on Twitter. He said he loved the tonight's show, he appreciated the audience, he said, ""Thanks again."" He said, ""I had no idea I did a two-hour set tonight."" He said, ""I am happily addicted again to doing standup, to being on the road."" And then he promoted his future dates. Now his Web site, which he mentioned there, that's crashed because there are so many people trying to visit his Web site right now, but he did have this active performance schedule going out on tour, doing standup. And as you mentioned, we don't know a lot about his death.

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to consider Arizona's controversial crackdown on illegal immigrants. The state had appealed federal court rulings that had blocked key parts of the reforms. The Obama administration has also argued against the measure saying immigration issues are under the exclusive authority of the federal government. Arizona says Washington has failed to control the problems and has a right to protect its residents. Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki is meeting with President Obama this hour. They're talking about how the two nations will cooperate in a new era without U.S. troops. We'll learn more next hour. They're actually holding a news conference. They'll also lay out a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery to honor our war dead. The U.S. is getting ready to pull pretty much all of its forces out of Iraq by the end of the month. About 6,000 men and women are still there. More than 4,000 U.S. troops were killed in the Iraq war. Nearly 32,000 of our men and women wounded. Even those who came home unscathed physically have scars. Many of them still fighting battles. The same battles could await those troops about to close the door on nearly nine years of war. CNN goes in depth on the final days of the conflict I had a chance to talk with a group of vets about how it's changed their lives forever.

What we don't want is a wind out of the northeast that blows wind, blows radiation, blows dust and all that back toward Tokyo, back toward the most populated places. And what we've seen so far -- now, this is going to be the next 45 hours, watch that wind barb right there because there's the plant, that wind barb kind of slips around a little bit, back and forth a little bit, but mainly offshore. Light and variable winds for the rest of the week, I would say less than five miles per hour. Now, they would like maybe a little bit higher than that to blow the radiation farther away, and not have it linger around the plant. But you get what you get and at least it isn't coming in. The way you get a big problem for Tokyo, we're going to plant a low right there, call it a nor'easter, a lot like what we'd have running up the East Coast as a nor'easter, low pressure center. If you get winds out of the northeast from that low, that would be the worst-case scenario for the population in Tokyo. That happened for a couple of days, a week and a half ago, and the radiation spiked in the Tokyo tap water. Not to a point where they were really concerned, but that's where the spike totally came from. KAYE: Can we talk about the Catlin Ice Base? MYERS: Sure.

It warmed up to zero. And they said they could really feel the warmth. Wow! You know, when you lower your standards to minus 30, I guess zero is OK. KAYE: Yes, look at this.

I mean, why doesn't that begin to build him a certain measure of sympathy from constituents that after all have sent him back to the Congress, you know, more than half a dozen times? STEVENS: I think the problem here is that there is a real question of criminal involvement. I mean, it's a different case when you have the chief of police in the District of Columbia saying, this guy is not helping us find out what happened to this woman. I think they just makes it a wildly different scenario here. And for these people and for these -- everyone to sort of come forth and talk about what a nice and sweet man he is, when in fact what people want to know is where is this woman, what was his involvement? He is not being helpful. GREENFIELD: E.J. FENN: Let me just make one quick point here, and that is that we are really not talking here, Jeff, about the sex police. We are talking about lying to the police and misleading the police. That is a very important distinction, I think. GREENFIELD: and E.J., maybe this is -- this is the key that makes a lot of our -- you know, all of our collective knowledge of scandals past and political strategy a little bit off the point. Now, to come to the one example I can think of that is on point, I can only think of one case where a politician's alleged involvement with a woman also involved the death, and that was Ted Kennedy and Mary Joe Kopechne. Why was he able, at least in Massachusetts, to survive that? DIONNE: Well, again, I think it goes back to the point about the base, and it's worth comparing how Ted Kennedy did in Massachusetts versus how he did later on in the 1980 primary campaign against Jimmy Carter. He has survived in Massachusetts and has continued to survive, because in Massachusetts, as you know, people will vote for almost anyone named ""Kennedy."" A gentleman who worked in a Chic safety razor factory put his name on the ballot for state treasurer, his name was John F. Kennedy and he won an election. It's a very special state my home state. I think when he went nationwide, it was still a burden on him, and so people hadn't forgotten it.

ANNOUNCER: This is LOU DOBBS TONIGHT for Thursday, August 7. Here now, Lou Dobbs. DOBBS: Good evening. Tonight: the return of what some health officials are calling a viral hurricane, the West Nile virus. The number of West Nile virus cases has tripled in just the past week in this country. Seven people have now died from the virus this year. The Centers for Disease Control says the number of cases is running ahead of last year's record, when 284 people died, more than 4,100 were infected. The United States last year experienced the largest outbreak of West Nile virus in the world. And this year may be even worse. Bill Tucker has the report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL TUCKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): West Nile is back, and moving fast. In mid-July, no mosquitoes captured in New Jersey showed West Nile. One week later, every sample showed the virus. There are now 164 human cases in 16 states, with seven dead from the virus; 22 more states report animal infections. Colorado leads the country with 72 reported cases. One year ago, there were no cases of West Nile virus. In addition, there are news reports of suspected cases not included in the figures from the CDC, which could expand the number of states. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There always is a tendency to see more human cases in the areas that have a greater density of population. So that's one of the explanations for that distribution. TUCKER: The CDC is urging prevention. Personal prevention comes down to using a repellent that contains deet, wearing long-sleeved clothing in the evenings, getting rid of standing water, getting rid of tires in particular, which are fertile breeding grounds for mosquitoes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the government is being very proactive, and it's getting the word out. TUCKER: The CDC emphasizes that control of mosquito population is the most effective way to contain the spread, but implementation of such policy falls to state and local health departments. Larvicide is used to kill the larva before it hatches. Spraying programs, while effective, are controversial, because the most effective chemical is DDT. DR. HENRY MILLER, HOOVER INSTITUTION: This is a product, like many, that is not entirely without risk, but the risk is primarily to decrease fertility in migrating birds.

And I would certainly lead, and others I am sure would join in leading an effort to establish a special prosecutor by legislation, probably appointed by a panel of the district court so that the choice of that special prosecutor would be completely nonpolitical. And I think there would be strong support for a special prosecutor, probably Bob Mueller himself to continue this investigation. Bob Mueller is following the money. He is looking at the financial dealings. That is not only appropriate, it is proper and necessary to do. And the President of the United States may be able to fire the attorney general. He certainly wants a political lackey in that role, a lap dog, not a watchdog, but he cannot fire the special prosecutor without extraordinary consequences on both sides of the aisle. I've talked to a number of my Republican colleagues who have already indicated that they would be prepared to act. TAPPER: Now, one of the problems that Democrats and Republicans have voiced in the past about special prosecutors are they end up investigating -- their first tasked with looking into a land deal, and the next thing you know they're looking into whether or not President Clinton had an affair with an intern. There are similar Republican complaints about the Valerie Plame leak investigation, who leaked Valerie Plame's name. But it ends up being a fishing expedition and that there are very few people in public life whose lives can bear that kind of scrutiny. To play devil's advocate once again. So Bob Mueller, let's say, is looking into President Trump's finances. We don't know if he is or if he isn't. What would an improper payment made in a lot -- at an Atlantic City casino have anything to do with the Russia investigation? I mean, does the president not have -- is there not a case to be made that this special counsel, the general counsel is supposed to be looking at possible collusion. He is not supposed to be looking at every single financial deal that a 71-year-old made. And certainly when it comes to New York real estate, I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think that anybody in New York real estate could probably -- probably has some skeleton in a closet one way or another. BLUMENTHAL: Well, there are questions like what was his Russian business associate representative (INAUDIBLE) of the Agalarov family doing at that June meeting where the Trump representatives -- in fact, the Trump campaign manager, his son-in-law, and his son were promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. So, those Russian financial dealings may be very relevant to collusion. Plus, money laundering is definitely a possibility. There were reports that Paul Manafort is under investigation for money laundering. Deutsche Bank, Trump's bank, President Trump's bank has encountered investigation and in fact potential prosecution ongoing criminally for money laundering. There are these allegations that are swirling around the collusion",0.1270526200554663,2017-07-21

Stock dipped below $27 this week. Matt McCall, by the way, is the founder of Penn Financial Group. Matt, with Facebook stock, around $10 cheaper than the opening, do you recommend the stock to viewers today? MATT MCCALL, PRESIDENT, PENN FINANCIAL GROUP: No. I continue to be bearish and negative on the stock at this price. There's a lot of uncertainty going around the stock right now and that keeps people away. We've seen big money shy away and now a lot of negativity floating around the stock. I truly believe Facebook see the low to mid-20s. At that point, it actually become as decent value and comparable to let's say Apple and Google at that point. So no, continue to sit on your hands. Be patient. You'll get a lower price. VELSHI: All right, when you say uncertainty. I want to give our viewers a sense of what you're talking about. It's not just a legal mess. There are lawsuits around the whole thing. There are a couple important events ahead that are likely to dictate where this stock goes in the near future. The first one and this is the most important thing when you buy a stock, it's the earnings. How much that company's going to earn. We don't have an exact date yet, but sometime in July or August Facebook will disclose its revenues, its expenses, its taxes, its profit, every public company does this for everybody to see. Wall Street has some big expectations forecasting 20 percent growth over the next year. The second thing you have to remember is the end of the 90-day employee wait period called a lockup period. That expires in August. After which a bunch of employees who may want to get rich off their shares may want to sell shares of Facebook. So all the shares go on the market, what could happen then? MCCALL: Well, when the shares go on the market, a lot of millionaires that worked for Facebook. Well, they're millionaires on paper, until they actually sell those shares and they're not really millionaires in my mind. So a lot of the people who have been sitting back on these shares for years when Facebook was nothing. Now they've become a millionaire and want to take the money and do something else with it. So I think we're going to see a lot of employees out there selling shares as soon as they're able to do that. Plus the fact they've seen paper value fall from $38 down to the mid- 20s, their value, they maybe millionaires now worth only $700,000. They see their wealth is kind of going by the wayside.

Is there a lot more that needs to be done? Absolutely. But they are going the right direction and I think my mother would be very pleased about what's happened in there. I talked to my father yesterday about this issue and he was very supportive in my position that we should not encourage outsiders going into China and breaking the law. We need to work within the law, Kyra. I believe that. PHILLIPS: Understand, and you know I have got to get a political question in there. Your mother was also great about keeping your dad in check when he was advising too many presidents.

So I'm curious, in a historical election here, are you going to step out and support a candidate? GRAHAM: No. PHILLIPS: No, you're not? How - what are you going to proceed through the presidential election? GRAHAM: I think the gospel of Jesus Christ is far more important than political rhetoric. And there's a lot of good candidates this year and I just pray that God's choice wins. I'm going to preach the gospel. I want men and women to know that Jesus Christ is the son of God who died for the sins of this world and if they confess their sins and repent and receive Christ by faith, that God will forgive them.

Plus, my conversation with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha. She says President Trump has opened a new peaceful chapter for the Korean Peninsula. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the program. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The US president's legal troubles are mounting; and this time, it is personal. The New York attorney general, Barbara Underwood, my guest tonight, is suing Mr. Trump's charitable family foundation with serious allegations including the illegal use of those funds for his presidential campaign and for settling his personal accounts. First, though, a quick reminder of Underwood's rise. Her former boss, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was a bombshell casualty of the Me Too era, accused by former female partners of shocking domestic violence. He denied the charges published in ""The New Yorker"", but still he resigned within hours. Barbara Underwood took his place. And she has a stellar record. A clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. First in her class at Georgetown Law School. And now, she's running New York's top law enforcement office, which has proven to be a major legal counterweight to some of President Trump's policies, for instance, on immigration, the environment. And today, as news of the lawsuit against Mr. Trump became public, Barbara Underwood joined me from New York for this exclusive interview. Attorney General Underwood, welcome to the program. BARBARA UNDERWOOD: I'm very glad to be here. AMANPOUR: So, firstly, congratulations. You are the first female attorney general of New York State and we will get more into that. But your first big case, which you're now announcing right now today, is an investigation into the Trump Foundation, into Donald Trump himself and indeed all three of his children. What exactly are you alleging and what has happened in this case? UNDERWOOD: What we are alleging is that this Trump Foundation violated a number of laws of the State of New York that govern the way a foundation, a non-profit corporation is required to govern itself and that - those were procedural violations - and that the money of that foundation was distributed for impermissible purposes - personal purposes, business purposes, political campaign purposes rather than for the charitable purposes that the foundation was established to perform. AMANPOUR: Can you give us particular details and how much money are we talking about? UNDERWOOD: I think $2.8 million that were spent for - that we allege were spent for improper purposes of the type I've just described. And then, there are penalties under the statute as well. So, what we're asking for is the return of - the restitution of the money that was improperly spent and then penalties for violating the law and, of course, the dissolution of the corporation and the distribution of whatever assets it",0.4076218041485769,2018-06-14

But, ultimately, he's got to have the person that best reflects his own views. He doesn't -- the secretary of state, secretary of defense, they don't set policy. It's the president of the United States. So, whomever he feels comfortable with, can carry out his philosophy, his objectives, that's the person to select. BLITZER: But you know, you were on the inside. You were secretary of defense for Bill Clinton. You had an impact on the eventual decision that the president of the United States has. And it's really critically important who a president surrounds himself to make these critically important decisions. Let me get back to General Mattis for a moment. COHEN: Sure. BLITZER: I interviewed him back at the Aspen Institute in 2013, the summer of 2013. I want you to listen to this exchange I had with General Mattis. We spoke for over an hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. JAMES MATTIS, FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: The single most biggest question I was dealing with in my last year was the perceived lack of U.S. reliability as an ally. We were able to overcome that often, working specific issues with them. That sort of thing. But it was something we have to work on. It's just a reality. It's a challenge but it's not to the point that they are willing to give up on the relationship with us. But we're going to have to demonstrate reliability because trust is what's it's all built on. That's the coin of the realm. And if you can't maintain trust, then your leadership is obsolete. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: So, that -- this was number three years ago. The biggest problem he faced was the lack -- the perceived lack of U.S. reliability as an ally. Is that still a huge problem for the U.S. right now, that the allies are worried about U.S. reliability? COHEN: Absolutely. It's a question of not being constant in our philosophy and in our actions. That's true with respect to the European friends who we had to pass a $3.2 or $3 billion European reassurance initiative. Think about that. We have to reassure European allies that we're still with them. We have great questions about our constant and reliability in the Middle East. And I'm sure that our Chinese friends also look with some certainly apprehension about what the policy is going to be, and all of our allies in the Asian-Pacific region. So, yes, we have an issue of whether or not we're a constant and reliable ally. BLITZER: Is that President Obama's fault? COHEN: I think it is generally. Congress has a role to play as well.

There's always concern that terrorists and terror groups will use the election as a time to maximize impact of any attack. As of yet, nothing specific, but there are threats. When it comes to Russia, though, there's enormous evidence already that a massive information operation, as intelligence agents call it, is already under way to discredit and sow doubts about a very crucial American presidential election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCIUTTO (voice-over): Tonight, growing concerns that Russia is waging an information operation to sow doubts about the U.S. election, several U.S. officials tell CNN. JEH JOHNSON, U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: This is something that the Department of Homeland Security, along with state election officials, have been very, very focused on. I have a lot of confidence in the integrity of our ballot-counting process. I have a lot of confidence in security and cyber-security around the process run by state and local election officials. SCIUTTO: Here at the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Command Center, they're now monitoring multiple threats. There's growing concern that more hacked documents and e-mails targeting campaigns could be released in the coming days, including potentially documents faked or altered by Russia. The U.S. has also detected the probing of state voter registration system, at least one of which has been linked to Russia, though they have yet to see those systems tampered with. DHS is now coordinating efforts with 48 states to prevent hacks, scamming computer systems to identify vulnerabilities. However, U.S. officials and cyber-experts make clear that the risk of actually changing the election result is minuscule. DMITRI ALPEROVITCH, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, CROWDSTRIKE: These machines are mostly offline. There's paper ballots that can be checked in most of these places and verified that the electronic result matches to what is printed on the ballot. So, it's almost possible to actually hack this election, but it's certainly possible for someone to claim it's hacked and to try to influence the public that way. SCIUTTO: Still, sowing doubts and disrupting the voting process is easier. The department will monitor for so-called denial of service attacks targeting voter information, mapping and news Web sites. Today, the Russian-linked hacking group Guccifer tweeted what appeared to be a threat. ""I will be an independent observer at the U.S. election 2016. I call on other hackers to monitor the elections from inside the system"" -- this minutes after another tweet accusing Democrats of rigging the vote, this as law enforcement officials already on high alert are monitoring intercepted conversations among al Qaeda adherents overseas about potential plots targeting New York, Texas and Virginia. But officials stress to CNN that the threat is nonspecific and could be idle chatter. JAMES O'NEILL, NEW YORK POLICE COMMISSIONER: It's nonspecific and right now we're assessing the credibility of it. But we're geared up to go all the time.

Yes, five suicide car bombings shaking relative stability in Baghdad on this Tuesday morning, attacks happening in the southern, central and western Baghdad.

Stan, you may remember that back in August the finance ministry was struck. They moved locations and that was targeted today. We are hearing scores dead. Over 450 people injured. The bottom line that we are hearing in all of this is that these terrorists are showing that they can strike high-profile attacks.

Thank you for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. We're following breaking news. Virginia Democratic Governor Ralph Northam has no plans to resign. And now he says he believes it was not him in this racist photo from his medical school yearbook, according to a Democratic source. A big flip from last night where he confirmed this was a photo in his yearbook and he was among the images there. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RALPH NORTHAM, (D), VIRGINIA GOVERNOR: That photo and the racist and offensive attitudes it represents does not reflect that person I am today or the way that I have conducted myself as a soldier, a doctor, and a public servant. I'm deeply sorry. I cannot change the decisions I made, nor can I undo the harm my behavior caused, then and today. (END VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: We'll hear from the governor, Governor Northam, in about an hour and a half, which is when he's scheduled to address the cameras, address the public. And of course, we'll bring that to you live as it happens. Meantime, let's start with CNN's Jessica Dean in Richmond, Virginia. So you're there outside of the governor's mansion. Has anyone seen him? We know there have been a number of protesters, demonstrators, right? People have showed up to express themselves in all of this. JESSICA DEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Fredricka, that's right. Protesters were here this morning. It's a little quiet as we get closer to when we're expecting to hear that statement from the governor at 2:30. But you know what? I go back to that video, that you just played everyone, where he was talking about my behavior, you know, the thing I did. And today, now, the governor coming out and saying, I don't believe it was me, it wasn't me, I believe the photos were mixed up, according to the source we have talked to. And we're also hearing from his spokesperson he will not resign today. Let me set the backdrop amongst him coming out -- or the spokesperson saying he's not going to resign. He has lost the support of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, of the Virginia House and Senate Democrats, of the Democratic Party of Virginia. Also, former governor, Terry McAuliffe, under whom Ralph Northam served as lieutenant governor, has come out and asked him to resign as well. All these groups calling for the governor to resign. Not to mention a host of the 2020 candidates who have come out and called for his resignation as well as Vice President Joe Biden and others. And I want to take you back also to the original statement the governor put out yesterday as",0.0388245281134525,2019-02-02

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VALDES-DAPENA (voice-over): Here at the Detroit Auto Show, Ford showed off the 2019 Ford Ranger. It's coming back to the U.S. and it's going to be built here at the Michigan assembly plant just outside of Detroit. I talked to Ford's global head of operations Joe Hinrichs about why the Ranger is important and what it's going to do for Ford and for the workers of this factory. (on camera): All right. So, right now, there's a lot going on. We are getting ready to build a Ford Ranger and which when is that going to start? JOE HINRICHS, FORD MOTOR COMPANY EXEC., VICE PRESIDENT & PRESIDENT, GLOBAL OPERATIONS: The production start at the end of 2018. Right now, what we are doing, we're going to pull ahead work on the conveyors and overhead system to get ready for the production which will start in the second half of the year. We'll balance out the Focus production in the second quarter of this year and then start converting the plant over completely during the summertime frame. VALDES-DAPENA: Now, as small car interest in the United States, has it fallen that much that there is just really doesn't make sense to make them here any more? HINRICHS: Well, it's been fascinating. About a ten-year run now, we've had SUV growth and truck growth and cars declining. Cars are still a substantial part of the industry here, but we identified an opportunity here to build Ranger and then eventually Bronco here. VALDES-DAPENA: So, are you employing the same number people here you employed before? HINRICHS: That's right. We're not going to lose any job. As a matter of fact, we anticipate growing some jobs as the Ranger and ultimately Bronco volume kicks in. VALDES-DAPENA: Why does it make sense to bring it back now? HINRICHS: Actually, we sold over 7 million Rangers between early '80s and 2011. What's happened is full-sized pickup trucks have gotten larger overtime. They got more expensive, a lot more capable. But what's happened with that size getting bigger and price going up, there is now room for a mid-sized truck. A little smaller, a little bit less pricey than the full-sized pickup truck but with the adventurous spirit an SUV or a truck can give you. (END VIDEOTAPE) VALDES-DAPENA: So, really it's cool to see, you know, all the work going on there. They're still making small cars but those workers are really happy to have those trucks coming in too that that are keeping their jobs there. PAUL: Oh, yes, no doubt about it. Peter Valdes-Dapena, thank you so much. Appreciate it. VALDES-DAPENA: OK. PAUL: Yes. BLACKWELL: All right. Coming up, Bill Murray as Steve Bannon on ""SNL"". I'm not saying anything else.

We'll have to deal -- will he have to deal with a recount, though, when he returns? We'll have details on that. And as America gives thanks, they will no doubt do so for the men and women fighting ISIS in Iraq. Our Fred Pleitgen flies along with the troops. Thanks for joining us. I'm Max Foster in London. This is CNN NEWSROOM. (MUSIC) FOSTER: Well, it is Thanksgiving morning in the U.S., and as families prepare to sit down for meals together, President-elect Trump is offering a message of unity. In a YouTube video posted late on Wednesday, he acknowledges the long and bruising political season and emphasizes bringing prosperity to inner cities. This is one of a handful of times that we've heard from the president-elect since the election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT: We are very blessed to call this nation our home, and that's what America is. It is our home. It's where we raise our families, care for our loved ones, look out for our neighbors, and live out our dreams. It's my prayer that on this Thanksgiving, we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country, strengthened by shared purpose and very, very common resolve. (END VIDEO CLIP) FOSTER: Perhaps in that spirit of unity, Trump is putting aside division with some of his former rivals, offering posts to two women who criticized him during the campaign. CNN's Jim Acosta has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As Donald Trump settles in for the Thanksgiving weekend, the president- elect is making room at the table for some surprising cabinet picks. For starters, his choice for ambassador to the U.N., one of his toughest GOP critics, Nikki Haley, saying in a statement, ""The South Carolina governor and daughter of Indian immigrants is a proven deal- maker. And we look to be making plenty of deals. She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage."" Explaining her decision to step down as governor, Haley said, ""When the president believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation and to our nation's standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed."" GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: When a bully hits you, you hit that bully right back. ACOSTA: Haley had a different calling in the primaries when she was backing Marco Rubio. She attacked Trump as a race-baiting bully. HALEY: I will not stop until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the KKK. That is not a part of our party. That's not who we want as president.

A lot of times, they will kind of cross the line of decency. But the decency line is different for every person. So I don't -- I don't agree with that. I think that that's just -- we have to take the bad with the good living in this country, and.. BATTISTA: Armstrong. WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I -- here's where he and I part ways. I actually think that the mainstream media is very biased, and I know we're dealing with First Amendment issues here. I mean, you take the issue of gun control, how the media portrays how guns are to control. They never portray the 2.5 million people who defend their homes and their communities with their guns in a very responsible way warding off criminals. You never see that side. Also, if you even look at the debate regarding the Confederate flag in my home state of South Carolina -- I'm an advocate that the flag should come down, but only because the South lost the war, and when you lose the war, you don't get a chance to rewrite history nor wave your battle flag. But South Carolina is not the only state that carries the battle flag. I mean, let's look at Georgia, let's look at Tennessee, and even let's look at Arkansas. But because it's a political year, it would be one thing if the media based its reporting and the NAACP based its reporting on principle, but it's based on political correctness. What is good for South Carolina is not good for the other states. And I think the American people see this hypocrisy. And let's go back to the people standing up in Atlanta for John Rocker. You have ethnic stations in this country where you have talk show hosts who make disparaging and bigoted comments against people in this country and no one says anything. But yet when John Rocker does it, we want to suspend him and fine him. And the American -- the American people see hypocrisy. If it's bad for John Rocker, then it should be bad for everybody else.

You are watching CNN NEWSROOM and we begin by looking back. It was only eight weeks ago, February 23rd. There were only 23 coronavirus deaths outside of China, 23. All right. Now there are more than 2.3 million cases of coronavirus worldwide and the death toll, more than 160,000. Now against that backdrop, growing frustration but also glimmers of hope. In Great Britain, there were fears the National Health Service would run out of some personal protective equipment or PPE this weekend. But what's being called a significant shipment from Turkey might be a much-needed lifeline. We'll discuss that in a moment. In Spain, the state of alarm will be now extended until early May, at least, making eight weeks of a strict lockdown there. And turning to Italy, the pope is going to hold mass outside the Vatican for the first time since the crisis began. Here, in the United States, word that critical, early delays in testing were likely caused by contamination at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab, as the Food and Drug Administration commissioner says antibody tests will indeed play a role in deciding when to reopen the country. And at the White House, U.S. president Donald Trump using Saturday's Coronavirus Task Force briefing to, yet again, lash out over and over, pointing fingers and saying any problems with testing are not his fault. CNN's Jeremy Diamond with that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It was the latest attempt by the president to shift blame elsewhere. The president on Saturday during a White House briefing blaming Democratic governors, accusing them, in fact, of not even wanting to use some of the testing capacity in their states, amid critical shortages. TRUMP: Now they're giving you the other, it's called testing, testing. But they don't want to use all of the capacity that we've created. We have tremendous capacity. Dr. Birx will be explaining that. They know that. The governors know that. The Democrat governors know that. They are the ones that are complaining. DIAMOND: As the president shifts blame to those Democratic governors, the president's own public health experts have acknowledged that there are shortfalls in the government's testing capacity across the country. In fact, it was the president himself who just on Friday was talking about sending 5 million additional testing swabs to states that needed it because of the shortfalls they're facing. But now the president once again blaming Democratic governors. And it is not just Democratic governors who are saying they need help from the federal government. We've also heard from the Republican governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, saying he also needs some of that critical chemical reagent to actually conduct those tests and to ramp up testing capacity across his state.

2058955,2375932,CNN,New Day,"(COMMERCIAL BREAK) ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR: Breaking news, a tragic update to that deadly fire that killed five children at a day care in Erie, Pennsylvania. The fire chief in Erie says three of those killed were the children of a firefighter from the same fire department that was there to battle the blaze. Authorities say the cause of the fire is under investigation but it may have been electrical. Investigators say the day care had just one smoke detector in the attic and noted that if there had been more, the tragedy could have been prevented. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, this morning, the president of the United States is pedaling in conspiracy theories over the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Why does this matter? Why should you care about this? John Avlon explains. Sir. JOHN AVLON, CNN ANCHOR: All right, guys, the conspiracy theorist-in- chief is at it again. I'm speaking, of course, about the president's decision to retweet a baseless conspiracy theory about the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein. We're not going to show you the tweet because it's pure nonsense, but suffice it to say the president's suggesting that the Clintons could be behind it. This is apparently the new normal. We must all confront again the fact that the president of the United States is fomenting hate, division and disinformation. (INAUDIBLE) strategy here as much as impulse, but he's promoted conspiracy theories before, most notably the racist birther conspiracy theory about Barack Obama. During the 2016 campaign he basically suggested the father of his primary rival, Ted Cruz, was somehow involved in JFK's assassination. But it's worth noting that the president's latest comes less than two weeks after a report by an FBI office in Phoenix, Arizona, warning against conspiracy theory driven domestic extremists. When the president spreads these theories, it's not just asking question, as Kellyanne Conway suggested, he's amplifying their message from the bully pulpit of the White House, and that leads some folks to believe him. What's doubly shameful is that he has access to the world's greatest intelligence service but apparently chooses to ignore them. Now, former acting solicitor general of the United States, Neal Katyal, said this, tweet was literally unfathomable. It would be outrageous even for a member of a local city council. It would. But, in some ways, that's the point. We're getting used to holding the president of the United States to a lower standard than a random city councilmember. You wouldn't tolerate this kind of behavior or lies from anyone in your life. Now, some folks might take comforted from the idea that the president's worst impulses are often contained. As one senior national security official told Jake Tapper, quote, everyone at this point ignores what the president says and just does their job. The American people should take some measure of confidence in that. But that's only comforting if you're OK with senior officials treating the commander in chief like a malevolent child.

You know, I think that if you were to imagine the special counsel's office, you would think about there's a white board with lots of different lines that are different parts of the investigation and Russia remains a central part of the investigation, that it -- there is this question was there quid pro quo. Remember, we still have not seen charges brought in connection with the computer hacking and the release of the emails. So, there are a number of pieces that are still outstanding. And I would suspect another line would be financial involvement in connection to the president and to his organization. And so, there are a lot of pieces that are still out there that we have reason to believe this will go on for some time. BERNSTEIN: Let me add one thing. (CROSSTALK) COOPER: Go ahead. BERNSTEIN: Go ahead -- that numerous witnesses and their lawyers have been telling journalists about how shaken they and their clients have been coming out of the interviews with Mueller's investigators, because of the depth of Mueller's investigators knowledge, because of the documents he has and because of the questions they've been asking in which the clients are asked to finger other people and tell everything they know about other people. And they indeed know about other people partly because Mueller's people have perhaps a million pages of emails and documents provided by the White House, but more than that by the Government Services Administration. And it gives Mueller's investigators great knowledge in which to question these witness and say, look, you tell us about X, Y, or Z, because we have here in our hand what isn't in an email from somebody else saying something that you better let us know what really happened here. And this is particularly relevant to dealings with Russia, Trump's income and what the Trump business organization does in terms of whether or not it operates aboveboard in that part of the world. COOPER: Jeff, I mean, to Carl's point about all the documents they have, would the White House be aware of the full scope of the documents that Mueller already has in possession? TOOBIN: Absolutely not. I mean, you know, what one of the cardinal rules of doing a white-collar investigation is you don't tell one person what you have seen from -- produced from other people. I mean, the White House obviously knows what documents it has produced and certainly the White House witnesses who have gone in to testify would be prepared and shown those documents. And there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, you know, all of us get hundreds of emails. There is nothing wrong with refreshing your recollection with, you know, seeing emails that you may not have seen for a year.

And one thing that doesn`t get a lot of credit but has revolutionized shopping, the bar code. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On June 26, 1974 a pack of Juicy Fruit gum made history when it was the first item ever to be scanned via a state- of-the art technology: the barcode. And now, more than 40 years later, as many as 5 billion barcodes are scanned every day across the world. The code itself, those black lines of varying width on the label, was inspired by Morse code. But the holy smokes component of the innovation was how it was scanned by lasers. Lasers had been the stuff of nerd fantasies until the early 1960s, when the Hughes Aircraft Company unveiled the first one at a press conference. A Los Angeles newspaper reported the story underneath the headline, ""LA man discovers science fiction death ray."" But the fact of the matter is, no one really knew what to do with that new technology until that June morning in 1974 when a pack of Juicy Fruit gum in Ohio changed the world. Today, barcodes are the unsung heroes that make everything from shipping to boarding an airplane to keeping track of medication possible. But the biggest beneficiary is retail. Think about a grocery store from yester-year. Every individual item had to be marked with its price, and the cashier had to manually input it into the register. So, thanks to the barcode, you`re waiting in the checkout line a whole lot less and the stores themselves benefited big time. The barcodes allow them to keep accurate, real-time inventory. That`s a major advance in efficiency, even if it cost some grocery staff their jobs.

BROWN: Yes, unbelievable. I want to bring in Marc, who, as we said, is the Heenes' neighbor. And this morning you saw the family in the yard. They were out there with the balloon. At one point, you heard commotion, I guess, when they thought the balloon had taken off. Tell us what you and your wife had seen or what you heard. FRIEDLAND: Well, yes. I had -- both my wife and I had seen the aircraft while it was -- you know, while it was still there. I had left to take a walk actually just to get some exercise for about a half-hour or so. And so when I left, sort of their whole family was still running around and, you know, pumping helium or whatever into the craft. And then, when I came back, my wife explained to me that she heard them -- Richard was yelling, oh, no. The craft had obviously taken off. It was only supposed to hover for about 20 feet in the air. And obviously something had happened where it did take off. And so there was a lot of commotion. I don't believe that they -- that they realized that Falcon was missing at that time. At first, it was just like, oh, my gosh, the craft has taken off, and, you know, we have lost that. And then some time shortly after that, I don't know whether it was a minute or five minutes -- it's hard to tell in that situation -- they realized that Falcon was missing. BROWN: And, Marc, I mean, tell us your reaction -- you knew the family -- when you found out that the little boy was, in fact, safe. FRIEDLAND: Oh, yes. Well, obviously, of course, there was tremendous relief and joy over the fact that, you know -- that he was found safe. And it was interesting because about 10 minutes before he was found, I came in, and I just -- I told my wife, you know, I just looked for him in our garage. And, you know, obviously, we're really close -- we're very close situated neighbors to them. And she said, well, you know, why would he be that scared that he would hide in the garage all that time?

At least we can make a distinction. AULETTA: That's the only thing we agree on. DOBBS: Absolutely. The reality for the national media, it seems to me, the way in which we watched for a week, Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska being lily pillared incapable news networks, newspapers, I would include certainly, ""The New York Times,"" ""Washington Post,"" Howard, I wouldn't want to leave anybody out; the ""Los Angeles Times."" That was an extraordinary period. I would suggest that probably half of the bounce, this extraordinary bounce apparently that McCain has received is attributed to the backlash. AULETTA: Dissect that a second. I don't question that the press made a lot of mistakes in covering Governor Palin. And you're right about that. But I think where you're wrong, is established the press didn't print go with the rumors that Kos spread rumors about her daughter giving birth to the baby and she covered up for the baby. DOBBS: You don't recall the mainstream media stories of the pregnancy of the 17-year-old of the governor? AULETTA: Isn't that a legitimate story when you're making an issue of your family? DOBBS: I don't know, we don't report -- AULETTA: Listen to Howie, he's absolutely right. They announced the campaign announcement. DOBBS: No, I understand that. Leading up to that announcement were rumors everywhere. The fact is we have a pretty clear standard that was set first by Bill Clinton with great vigor to leave his family out of it. We have violated that. I think it can be argued rather effectively. The mainstream media is moving downscale when it comes to covering that sort of thing. KURTZ: Well, I want to put in a different category the very legitimate pieces national reporters have gone to Alaska to report on the governor's record, whether she was against the bridge to nowhere. She was for it originally. Now she claims she's against it. But I must say I've been very troubled by the condescending tone, forget about the rumors.

But if I can predict, I predict that if they choose a target, it will be a soft target. MACVICAR: And that will mean more civilian casualties. AL-FAISAL: Unfortunately, this is what terror means. This is why the people of Saudi Arabia in their wisdom know that there is no way that you can condone any action of terror, no matter what the target is.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) MANN: The U.S. Defense Department is not taking any chances. On Tuesday, it raised the alert level for U.S. military installations worldwide from significant to high. That's the military's top level. Officials at the Pentagon say terrorists are active and operating in an environment that favors a large-scale attack. The warning comes a day after U.S. civilian authorities went to their 2nd highest state of alert. Welcome back. U.S. authorities and their counterparts may have good reason to be worried. On Tuesday, a recording said to come from Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant called on Muslims to attack Jews and U.S. interests worldwide. CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Heavily edited and occasionally inaudible above background noise, this message calls for attacks on U.S., British, Australian and Norwegian embassies and interests. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Protests, demonstrations and conferences will not be enough. You will only benefit by taking arms and using them against the enemies, the Americans and the Jews. Protests are a waste of time. ROBERTSON: Not clear if the audio tape is of Ayman al-Zawahiri's voice, although it is Egyptian accented, like Zawahiri, it sounds much younger than the al Qaeda leader. Zawahiri or not, the tape tells Muslims the war in Iraq is a prelude to U.S. and Israeli domination of the region, aided and abetted by Arab leaders. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Here are the rulers of the Muslims granting airports, bases and facilities and allowing the ships to cross their territorial waters and supplying them with fuel and food and granting permission to the planes to cross the air spaces and to launch air raids from the airports. ROBERTSON: Apparently recorded some time after the war I Iraq began, the broadcast portion of the audiotape makes no direct reference to the attacks in Saudi Arabia and Morocco last week. It does, however, offer support the Iraqi people and hint at more attacks.

BLITZER: The latest CNN-Time magazine poll did show that he has incredibly high job approval ratings, along the lines of Rudy Giuliani. Colin Powell much higher than president -- than most of the other members of the Bush team. GEORGE: That's right, but it's not -- it's not a disaster if Powell leaves at the end of the first term. BLITZER: He will have served four years. GEORGE: He will have served four years, and members leaving the administration at the end of four years -- I mean, that happens -- that happens all the time. I think Ryan is right, this was actually a shot across the bow. Basically, Powell gaining certain leverage, basically saying, that, you know, if he is -- if he is embarrassed by other members of the administration, he may leave early, and that could cause a political problem for the president. BLITZER: I know Colin Powell; you know Colin Powell. He is a team player. He has his own views, but he is not going to do anything that is going to undermine the president of the United States, if the president makes a decision. BRAZILE: Well, he has been a very loyal supporter to this president. And, look, the truth is Bush needs Powell. Powell does not need President Bush. Poll numbers notwithstanding, he is the only credible voice this administration has in talking to the world at large. So I would think that if they lose General Powell, Secretary Powell when the president (UNINTELLIGIBLE) his first term, perhaps they say, well, it doesn't make a difference, but he has been a credible voice for this administration. BLITZER: You don't think Rumsfeld and Cheney are credible voices talking to the world? BRAZILE: Who listens to them? They listen to Powell. They wait for Powell. The world waits for Secretary Powell, because they see him as a moderating influence and someone who understands the world at large. (LAUGHTER) GOLDBERG: There is this thing in the Constitution which says the president gets to appoint the secretary of state, so at least in one narrow aspect, Colin Powell needs George Bush if he wants to be secretary of state. And, look, on the larger issue -- who knows what this is about. Maybe Colin Powell wants to carve out some leverage in the administration. He's an old -- he's also a team player, he's an old pro at these sorts of leak games. Maybe he just ate some bad clams. We don't know. I mean, this is just one of these things where he is sending a shot across the bow to somebody, and, you know, we'll see.

KAYE: Virginia Author John Tucker wrote a book about the Coleman case. (on camera): What makes you believe that Roger Coleman did not kill Wanda McCoy? TUCKER: There are witnesses who saw Mr. Coleman that evening by himself. And the most important one saw him at about 10: 30. If he was at that place at 10: 30, he could not have committed the crime. KAYE (voice-over): Still, prosecutors won their case, even without state-of-the-art DNA technology available today. TOM SCOTT, FORMER PROSECUTOR: We know that Coleman had O Type blood on his jean pants, and we know that the victim had O Type blood. We know that Coleman had B Type blood. We know that the rapist had B Type blood. KAYE: No one could have guessed then that today the story would finally end here, at this DNA testing lab in Toronto. Despite the prosecutor's confidence in their murder conviction, Virginia Governor Mark Warner ordered the tests. MARK WARNER, VIRGINIA GOVERNOR: Because it will either confirm the guilt. It may demonstrate, and there's a high probability that it will remain inconclusive. Or it may to some degree exonerate him. KAYE: Coleman's DNA, stored for nearly 25 years, is being compared to vaginal swabs taken from the victim. (on camera) If the DNA test comes back indicating that it is not Roger Coleman's DNA, did the state of Virginia execute an innocent man? SCOTT: Well, there are certainly some that would argue that. It doesn't automatically exclude him. It just excludes him from being the rapist. KAYE: Experts say DNA results are so accurate, only an identical twin could have the same genetic profile. What if, in 2006, you find out that it wasn't Roger Coleman's DNA? And say he's still here, would you have prosecuted him? SCOTT: I'd have to re-evaluate that. I mean, I'm not sure. And if I did, I'm not sure whether or not we would seek the death penalty. (END VIDEOTAPE) KAYE: Prosecutor Tom Scott, certainly believing that the DNA samples will match. But if they don't, Anderson, this will be the first time that a man was executed, only later to be exonerated. We are expecting the results of these DNA tests tomorrow. Our sources close to these test results are telling us possibly as early as the morning hours. But there is some concern tonight, Anderson, about the integrity of these samples, how they have fared over the last 25 years. They've been moved around the country, they're now in Toronto. Lots of folks here wondering about the condition of that DNA sample. But I did speak with a DNA expert tonight, and he tells me that the samples have been stored at very low temperatures, actually cold temperatures, and he expects that that would certainly slow down the deterioration process of the sample.

And I thought it was important for the president to know this, that's why I briefed the speaker this morning and I came down here as soon as I could. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZELENY: Now, it's important to point out, he is leading an investigation into an entirely separate branch of government here. So, you know, sure idea of him coming down to share information certainly raised a ton of eyebrows. Yes, he was on the -- he was a supporter of the president. He worked on his campaign committee and transition committee, which isn't all that unusual, but the sheer fact that he showed up here certainly raises questions about his objectivity and now tonight has thrown the entire investigation up in the air potentially. COOPER: And while the president, you know, earlier said he felt partially vindicated clearing that tweet tonight, it sounds like he's, you know, feeling even more vindicated. I mean, others are saying the timing and presentation of the information itself is suspect. ZELENY: The timing is very interesting indeed. I mean, look what else is going on today. It seems like, you know, several hours have several different things have happened, of course, but the Democrats simply say that they were blindsided by this. This is simply, you know, was coming out of left field entirely. So the top Democrat on the Congressional -- on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, he had this to say after digesting all of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF, (R) INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: And unfortunately, I think the actions of today throw a great doubt into the ability of both the chairman and the committee to conduct the investigation the way it ought to be conducted. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZELENY: So the question is now what is coming after this. Now, Democrats, of course, will be calling for an in independent investigation. Republicans control the House, so that is not likely to happen. But there is a separate investigation happening all together here, and the Senate Intelligence Committee did not want to come anywhere near this it seem today. They are doing their own investigation. The FBI is also investigating separately, so the fact that this looked like a lifeline for the White House may not be as long of one as they had hoped.

JONES: They have made dozens of decisions that said the same thing. That's always been our law. COOPER: Right. JONES: Congress has always had that power. COOPER: Well, also, I mean... JONES: And to say... COOPER: I'm sorry. When -- when -- especially when you look -- I mean, you could say, OK, he's making a principled stand or whatever, but when you look at his own record on this very same law regarding TWA Flight 800, then, you know, it doesn't make sense. JONES: And -- and since I haven't been able yet to speak to Senator DeMint -- and I suppose I never will -- I have had to speak to the policy staffer that will discuss it with me. And she just says she has no explanation for it. The senator has no explanation for it. They say that was 10 years ago; that's the way he voted then, but he's not going to vote that way now. And why there's a difference, I wish I knew. COOPER: Yes. JONES: I could -- I could appeal to him on the basis of that, I suppose. COOPER: Well, we obviously invited him on the program tonight. He declined that invitation. We will continue to try to figure out, get an answer, if -- if we can, from him. I just wanted to ask. I had talked to you a little in the break.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) BANFIELD: Recently, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department is pulling out of a program that you may not even known existed. Something called Civil Asset Forfeiture, that is very fancy language for a program where the government can just take your money. Yeah, just take it. Or even your property too if they think that you have used it in a crime. Just think. You don't even have to be charged to make them take your stuff, but just because the federal government's backing off this thing, it does not mean that the state and local governments where you live are doing the same thing, far from it. Our Gary Tuchman has this terrific look at an example of what can happen in real life, this is part one of his CNN investigation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GARY TUCHMAN, CORRESPONDENT: It's a broad clear morning in April 2013. Inside that red car just ahead are these two men, Mark Davis and John Newmerzhycky, two friends who also happen to be professional poker players. On this dashcam footage in the distance, you can see the red car flashing a turn signal indicating to pass a black SUV. A few minutes later, an Iowa state trooper pulls them over. And what did he say? JOHN NEWMERZHYCKY, PROFESSIONAL POKER PLAYER: He said I didn't used my blinker and he was going to write me a citation, it'll only take a minute and to come with him to get in his car. TUCHMAN: It was the beginning of an encounter with what eventually would be two Iowa state troopers. Professional poker players often travel with quite a bit of money which they use in tournaments around the country. The troopers pulled this bag of briefcase out of the trunk and found $85,000 in cash belonging to Mark Davis, and another $15,000 belonging to Newmerzhycky. And the officers took it, they took it all. MARK DAVIS, PROFESSIONAL POKER PLAYER: This was the briefcase that I was carrying. It was locked. They threatened to destroy it if I didn't give them the combination. TUCHMAN: So, you carried money on this all the time for poker, right? I mean you have money in it right now? DAVIS: I do. I brought it along because I happen to have... TUCHMAN: Just -- normal it is. DAVIS: ... some money. I got that from the bank. TUCHMAN: So how much is this? DAVIS: That's $10,000. Before traveling intercity (ph), I would seal it. TUCHMAN: The two men wound up being questioned for hours. They were given a traffic warning but not a citation. Newmerzhycky plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of possession of marijuana paraphernalia, which he said was used for medical marijuana. Troopers let the men go but took the $100,000.

863066,1140791,CNN,State Of The Union With Candy Crowley,"they're trying to say is the Republican Party, if it has a narrow base, cannot win and do anything. People are concerned about the economy. We need to do that instead of bringing up which are really divisive issues, particularly when you look at the independents, things like gay marriage... BAUER: Right. CROWLEY: Other -- things like abortion. These are all issues that tend to particularly divide the independents whose votes you need. BAUER: Look, the -- all these issues -- every issue is divisive in America today. Are my Republican friends going to tell me that reforming Social Security is not divisive? Of course it is. The whole tax cut debate is a very divisive issue. These values issues actually expand the Republican Party. They don't narrow it. Independence doesn't -- doesn't equate to moderates. Millions of independents are pro-life. Millions of independents believe marriage is between a man and a woman. One more quick point on this, Candy. There was a vote in California, a very liberal state, on the marriage question just a couple of years ago, and Los Angeles, which John McCain lost massively -- the people of Los Angeles voted overwhelmingly to keep marriage between one man and one woman. And those were essentially African- American and Hispanic voters. So these values issues, I would say to my Republican friends, are what we need to grow the party, not to shrink it. CROWLEY: Let me turn to you the money question. You are co- chair of one group that is putting ads on the air usually concerning people's -- candidates' support for or against Israel... BAUER: Yes. CROWLEY: ... and do not disclose the donors. Would you do that? Would you give me the name of the donors? BAUER: No, of course not. CROWLEY: Why not? BAUER: Because these are issue ads, and under the laws of the United States and repeated court rulings... CROWLEY: But they're attacking Joe Sestak, so that's not quite an issue. That's a, like, don't -- don't vote for this guy. BAUER: No, it doesn't. It never says in the ad, don't vote. If you say vote for or vote against, then it is a direct political ad. CROWLEY: That's a nuance. That's a nuance. BAUER: Well, look, I think... CROWLEY: Do you think voters don't come away from that thinking, oh, I shouldn't vote for Joe Sestak? BAUER: Look, I don't write the laws and I don't make the court decisions. And the courts have said, for very good reasons, I might say, that, in these kinds of ads, there doesn't have to be disclosure. The first court decision on this involved the NAACP in Alabama. Somebody wanted to get their list of donors. Bigots wanted to get the list of donors so they could harass the people that were donating to the NAACP. The reason this disclosure issue is so important, Candy, quite frankly, is that, on the left in this country, there has been in recent years",0.2555473436345198,2010-10-17

You know, I hear that, you know, nothing has changed. Talk to Rudy. That kind of dialogue as I described. CASTOR: And when the President said that the Ukrainians tried to take him down, did you have any idea of what he was referring to? VOLKER: I did. I believed he was referring to the rumors of efforts to interfere in the 2016 election by providing damaging information about the President or about Paul Manafort to the Hillary Clinton campaign. That was one of the rumors that had been out there and that had gotten some support from the Ukrainian prosecutor general. CASTOR: And to the best of your knowledge the President genuinely believed that, right? VOLKER: I believe he was concerned about it. I don't know what he actually believed but he brought it up. CASTOR: And Mr. Morrison, you were also aware of the President's skeptical view of foreign aid generally? MORRISON: Yes. CASTOR: And that there was initiative that he was looking at foreign aid pretty broadly? MORRISON: Yes. CASTOR: Trying to scrutinize to make sure the U.S. taxpayers were getting their moneys worth? MORRISON: Yes. CASTOR: And the President was also interested, was he not, in better understanding opportunities for increased burden sharing among the Europeans? MORRISON: Yes. CASTOR: And what could you tell us about that? MORRISON: The President was concerned that the United States seemed to bare the exclusive brunt of security assistance to Ukraine. He wanted to see the Europeans step up and contribute more security assistance. CASTOR: And was there any interagency activity, whether it be with the State Department or the Defense Department coordination by the National Security Council to look into that a little bit for the President? MORRISON: We were surveying the data to understand who was contributing what and sort of in what categories. CASTOR: And so the presidency events (ph) concerns the interagency tried to address them? MORRISON: Yes.

Susan Lisovicz is at the New York Stock Exchange helping us track it all. Susan, what's dragging the marketing down today? Is it that housing report we talked about last hour? SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. We opened weaker and then that housing report where we were expecting an uptick Tony really accelerated the sell off. That came about 30 minutes after the opening bell. Existing home sales, the broadest part of the housing market fell 5.3 percent in January to a 12-year low. Sales, prices meanwhile fell nearly 15 percent. So you're just seeing more stress in the housing market and that just brings us to stress tests in the financial sector. The Treasury Department today beginning those stress tests on the nation's biggest banks to determine how they fare if the recession deepened. Ben Bernanke is making an encore performance on Capitol Hill today and he said specifically that the government doesn't plan to nationalize Citigroup. There's been a lot of concern about that (INAUDIBLE) particular but that Uncle Sam could end up with a bigger stake in the banks, it depends on the stress test. Citigroup and Bank of America shares are higher, but overall you're looking at double digit losses. The Dow right now down 135 points or about 2 percent, the NASDAQ and the S&P; 500 down 2 percent as well. Tony. HARRIS: OK, Susan, thank you. LISOVICZ: You're welcome.

So that I think because we are so closely interrelated and growing more so, I think the whole global consensus about issues like environment is going to strengthen. MANN: And yet when it comes to a global consensus, the United States sometimes backs away. The Kyoto Accord on greenhouse gases comes to mind. The United States was a holdout. Is it unfairly criticized for decisions like that? Because in the years since, of course, other nations have found they're not quite going to meet Kyoto targets. Or is it really letting down the rest of the world when it comes to making decisions about pollution, about consumption, about global issues together? GUPTA: Jonathan, you know, a lot of this is political theater. When it comes to global treaties, I mean, it's the particular parties and politics of a nation that plays a major role in it. The fact with the Kyoto Treaty is that the other nations of the world have shown that it almost doesn't matter what America says in Washington. The fact is that the actions taken by American companies overseas, even, indeed, the actions taken by the American government overseas in protecting the environment of other countries through USAID and aid programs, shows that what the rhetoric suggests in Washington isn't quite what really works on the ground. So I'm a little bit more optimistic than I think some people tend to be. MANN: One last quick question for you. There is an old assumption, you alluded to it a moment ago, that more people is a problem. It goes back more than a century. So is there good news on Tuesday when the 300 millionth American is born? Or should we just be even more nervous about crowding this country and crowding the world? GUPTA: Not at all. I used to think that it was, as you mentioned my book, ""The Crowded Earth,"" that we really had a population problem. Yes, we do in certain countries. But America has a lot of space. Most importantly, America is the land of opportunity and a big, big domestic market, and it drives the economic engine of the world. So, yes, I mean, there is concern if environmental laws are not implemented and if the kinds of problems your correspondents referred to continue. But my own sense is that good sense and common sense will prevail and that I think we are in for a more progressive future. MANN: Pranay Gupta, his Web site is PranayGupta.com.

ROMANS: Well, you know, so much of the conversation around Build Back Better is political. I mean, guys, it's just the facts. I mean what the message about prices is, help for your -- help for your childcare costs, you know, school, you know, quality pre-k, these are the things that can lower costs for families, and that's where the White House, I think, the message hasn't been securely on that, at least in the minds of so many voters and people who -- when you talk to these people -- they are polled and they say they feel pretty rotten about the economy overall. So, yes, that is the political messaging that is so interesting here. The Fed, by the way, is the inflation fighter. We should point this out again. The -- it is in the Fed's wheelhouse to fight inflation. And that means raising interest rates. And that might be something, if they do it wrong, could actually hurt the economy overall. So, here into 2022, you guys, we have a real interesting balancing act in terms of the economy. It is roaring ahead, prices are rising because of it, and now it's the Fed's job to try to get things back in balance. BERMAN: Highest inflation since 1982, ""Ebony and Ivory,"" as Christine Romans says, number one on the charts. But I will say, the political agenda from the White House and inflation not together in perfect harmony. ROMANS: Well done. Well done. BERMAN: Christine Romans, thank you very much. ROMANS: John Berman, who wears a rugby from 1982, I know for sure. BERMAN: Yes. Proudly. Thank you so much, Romans.

Some of the local tea (ph) houses that we stay in have been damaged or don't have their usual electricity or water sources. So certainly some of the groups have started heading down. And, of course, some of the local mountain workers, the Sherpa people and other ethnic groups that work here at Everest base camp, they're worried about their families because they can't get through to them on the phone. So there is a movement starting and it will continue to accelerate over the next few days. BANFIELD: It is such a desperate situation for so much of that country. And I just want to set the scene for maybe those who are watching our program right now who aren't as clear on how Everest works. But effectively you're at the command central where everybody stages their ascent for the peak and there are several base - there are several camps above base camp. And as I understand it, Jim, you were two camps above base camp when this earthquake and then the subsequent avalanche hit, is that correct? DAVIDSON: Just about. You described it well. It is -- Everest base camp is sort of the command center. People flock from all over the world and all over Nepal to come here. We get our equipment organized and the teams support one another and we start climbing the mountain. There are four camps above Everest - Everest base camps. There's camps one, two, three and four. (INAUDIBLE) which is, of course, the first stop above Everest base camp when the avalanche - when the avalanches occurred due to the earthquake about two days ago. BANFIELD: You are just so incredibly fortunate to have survive that alone. And then if - I know I can hear some trouble with our sat line to you and if I still have you, Jim, maybe if you could describe for me the fact that you could not descend, nor could any of the other climbers who had ascended, to those upper camps because the infrastructure was gone. The ropes were gone. Everything you need to get up and down that mountain was effectively buried by this onslaught of snow, rock and ice. Did those helicopters get everyone off the mountain above base camp? Is everybody cleared from those very dangerous and deathly zones? DAVIDSON: Yes, you are correct, and I verified that with some of the folks in charge of the helicopter evacuations today. As of late afternoon, everybody from camp two and everybody from camp one has been successfully airlifted out by helicopters. And you're also correct, that that had to be done because the ropes and the ladders we uses to cross hundreds and hundreds of stable - of unstable ice blocks, those were all destroyed completely during the earthquake and during the avalanches that happened after the earthquake.

But when we're working, do Americans clock the most hours? No, according to the United Nations. It counted up how many people in different countries work a long week, at least 48 hours. In the U.S., 18 percent do. That number is higher in Switzerland and Australia. In both Britain and Israel, 26 percent of workers put in that kind of time. The numbers are substantially higher in many developing nations. In Peru, half the workforce worked more than 48 hours a week. Now, who in America works the most hours? The federal government looked at more than 300 jobs, and in just a few cases, it found an average workweek of more than 50 hours. Among those clocking that kind of time, firefighters, doctors, marine engineers, animal breeders, extraction workers, riggers, hoist and winch operators, and those who operate trains and ships.

LEVS: ...of 300 jobs, those were the ones that worked the longest weeks. WHITFIELD: Wow, and so people think, well, if you're going to work all this -- all these hours, then where's the payment? LEVS: Yes. WHITFIELD: So, you broke it down even in terms of incomes, families versus individuals, disparities. LEVS: Exactly, looked at that, too. Really interesting stuff and brand-new figures that just came out this week. Let's take a look at this. What happened here is that the census came out with an announcement that families are making more money, but that individuals are making less. All right, so if you think about that for a second, how is that possible? Here's why. In more families, you've got both parents working full time. So that's what we're hearing from analysts. So, you'll hear cery often, and we'll hear this, Fred, from government leaders, that families are making more money these days, but that's because, in more cases, you've got both parents working. WHITFIELD: Double incomes. LEVS: Individual income on average has actually gone down across the country. So, we're hard-working and we're making a little bit less. WHITFIELD: So you're being penalized if you're not in a family, is that what we're saying, if you're not married or something? LEVS: Well, comparing individuals within the family. (INAUDIBLE).

Let's tackle Iraq first, because while Michael just did a great job explaining the U.S. role and how it is evolving and changing, the U.S. could very well, the troops be roped into, upon request of the Iraqi government, to go beyond or get involved once again in any kind of military or combat capacity if requested by the government is that troublesome or is that a worry? BORZOU DARAGAHI, ""LOS ANGELES TIMES:"" You know, there's several different types of violence in Iraq, and the one that the U.S. was back there quelling was the kind of sectarian violence that plagued the country in 2006 and 2007. What you see now is mostly suicide bombings, car bombings, sporadic outbreaks of violence and I think -- and I would defer to Michael Ware who is a friend and knows a lot more about this stuff than I do at this time, but I think that the U.S. military people that I've spoken to are convinced that information, infiltration and intelligence operations are the way to combat that type of violence, those kinds of one-off suicide bombings rather than having divisions of heavy armor inside a city. WHITFIELD: Meantime, while we talk about these affairs and what could or is expected to take place beginning Tuesday in Iraq, Iraq has not said very much, has it, about its neighbor of Iran, the disputed election, all that's transpiring. Why is that? DARAGAHI: Well, I think to some extent, they are watching what's happening, they are very worried because events in Iran could very well spill over in Iraq. Both countries have majority Shiite populations. Not only that, there is a serious connection between the senior clergy in the cities of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq and the Ayatollahs in Iran.

He's also, again, not one of these people that's going to use the military force just because. He understands how this all works and the depth of American foreign policy. And his troops loved him. I mean, this is something that's -- it's like a General McArthur kind of thing. His troops that worked for him, I've talked to a lot of them. They said that this guy would have walked into hell for them. And that's the kind of leader that we need in the secretary of defense position. So I'd love it if it's Mattis, and hopefully, he gets there. BLITZER: If that happens with the secretary of state, secretary of defense, looks like you'll be totally on board with Donald Trump, the president-elect of the United States. How concerned are you, Congressman, though, about Donald Trump apparently still involved in running his businesses and the children are running the company while still playing a major role in his transition. Today Trump told ""The New York Times,"" and I'm quoting him now -- the law is totally on my side. The president can't have a conflict of interest. Now. how problematic is that point of view, if you think that it is? KINZINGER: Well, I think that it can be problematic.

And that seems to be part of the problem. So we think from a practical point of view, a number of these issues could be fairly easily resolved. ROBERTSON (on camera): So you were misinformed? FONDRE: With information that we received does not seem to be either complete or correct in certain instances. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTSON: What is the headline from the politicians here is that we can resolve this. The reality for the fishermen is their income to the island is relatively small, almost minuscule, you can say compared to that that comes in from tourism, even compared to the money that comes in from French tourists coming here. France and Jersey have huge history together shared heritage and in some ways, so you know, politically, they're really sort of trying to put a lid on this and bring the temperature down Becky. ANDERSON: It's fascinating, isn't it? And I wonder whether they can put a lid on this and that will suit those in Jersey. But whether we will see more fractious, sort of behavior between the UK and France when it comes to fishing going forward is another question of course? But while I'm sure you will keep your eye on.

HILL: Moves that can happen so quickly, there isn't time to respond, which many speculate may have caused Saturday's deadly crash, when a small private plane and sightseeing helicopter simply didn't see one another, and collided. (on camera): One of the main thing pilots rely on an airspace like this one up and down the Hudson is not necessarily a radio or an air traffic control tower, because of the altitude they're flying at. Instead, it's their own eyes, something you call the see-and-avoid tactic, basically looking out for everything around you. ZANLUNGHI: See, like I just picked up the helicopter probably 500 feet above us. See, similar to being in a car, you're always looking around. If you're not looking around, you're going to get bumped by somebody. HILL (voice-over): They're also a dedicated radio frequency for the airspace below 1,110 feet. Pilots register their location as they pass well-known landmarks. ZANLUNGHI: That's the Statue of Liberty right off to our right. Three helicopters just left here. We were all in contact with each other, (INAUDIBLE) That is the way it supposed to be done on the river. HILL: Supposed to be, but it isn't required. And, while this pilot doesn't see the Hudson as an especially crowded area, after Saturday's midair collision, there are definitely more eyes on this airspace. REP. JERROLD NADLER (D), NEW YORK: It is unconscionable that the Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, permits unregulated flights in a crowded airspace in a major metropolitan area. The Hudson River flight corridor must not continue to be the Wild West. HILL: But, to Pete Zanlunghi, it is not more any more wild than the roadways. Still, he would not mind a few changes. ZANLUNGHI: Well, I would like to see airplanes (INAUDIBLE) of above 800 or 900 feet. That's where helicopters (INAUDIBLE) feet (INAUDIBLE) and all the helicopters, because we're landing on the rivers. These helicopters and heliports have operated for 50 years (INAUDIBLE) HILL: And this pilot would like it to stay that way.

It was interesting today. I asked him what it's like on a normal day. Because today there was still that temporary flight restriction in place. And we also went up just before the Yankees game started. And interestingly enough, there are other flight restrictions an hour before and an hour after. It was a little quiet. On a normal day, he said probably 10 to 15 aircraft, which he doesn't consider to be very busy. ROBERTS: Over the course of an entire day, only 10 to 15? HILL: Well, when he's flying that particular -- keep in mind, you're not in that space for too long. He said that would be sort of an average day when he's going up and down that space.

He gave you the ball and then everyone on the bench realized that's Brady's 600th career touchdown pass. There's a problem with that. So first of all just I can see it in your face there about how excited you were. What was it like to get the ball from Mike Evans? KENNEDY: Oh it was incredible. Just listening to that audio there it puts a smile on my face. Just I can hear how excited I was. That was such an incredible moment for me. BERMAN: Now you didn't know at the time exactly that it was such an important ball, did you? KENNEDY: No. Not right when he handed it to me. Pretty soon afterwards I realized because I knew that was going to happen at some point in this game. I just didn't - as Tom Brady threw it I didn't realize that was the 600th touchdown. BERMAN: So then what happens? KENNEDY: So I'm in the stadium celebrating with everyone. Everyone's congratulating me, wants to take pictures, touch the ball and everything. And then the guy, Tim, comes over. He works with the Bucs. Said basically listen, can we get that ball back, please. And I told him no a couple times. I'm - had never had anything like that happen to me before. It was so cool. I just wanted to keep that football. And we kept going back and forth and he's basically saying Tom Brady really wants this football. And like I said earlier, what am I going to do? Say no to Tom Brady? Like he deserves that football. He's the one who broke all these records, so I ended up giving it back. BERMAN: Now, did you set conditions? Did you start saying this is what I want in return? KENNEDY: Not really, no. He was saying like we can get you some signed jerseys, this and that, maybe he'll come over and say hey afterwards. One thing I did do is when they were mentioning signed jerseys I asked if I can get a second one for my buddy sitting next to me because he was the season ticket holder. He's who brought me to the game, so I wanted to get him a little something out of this, too. BERMAN: Well that's smart, and also nice of you. (CROSSTALK) KENNEDY: But that was really it.

Another truth is that voting in Pennsylvania is already going very smoothly, actually. The one documented case of voter fraud in this cycle in our state was actually a Republican in Lucerne County who attempted to vote for his dead mother. So, the truth of the matter is, voting works very much so in Pennsylvania and it really is going to continue to do so. COOPER: So, what happens to the votes that the president is talking about? Are they going to be counted now or are they just going to be just put aside? FETTERMAN: Yes. They're being sequestered right now, the ones that would come in after the election deadline, the three-day deadline that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled was acceptable as long as those ballots were postmarked. And ultimately, if that decision ends up at the Supreme Court, of course, that would be the concern given the way the court is stacked in favor of a conservative presidential viewpoint at that point. COOPER: On the night before election, the president is continuing to spread totally debunked claims about widespread voter fraud and suggesting there is going to be violence in the streets. How worried are you about the safety of people, or to anybody in your state who -- in your commonwealth, who is worried about what may happen in the polls? What do you say to them? FETTERMAN: I'm not concerned, to be quite frankly, because I think everyone in Pennsylvania understands that regardless of what side they're on and who they're going to vote for, that there is not going to be any violence, there's not going to be any widespread incidents like that. I mean, sure, there might be an isolated case. When you have tens of millions of people doing anything, there might be very much a case. But the bottom-line is this, is that I think Pennsylvania's election on balance. It's going to go smoothly and we are going to deliver a result that your viewers and our nation are going to be able to count on. Our top three or four counties have already determined that they're going to count the ballots relatively quickly and be able to determine a result. Philadelphia might take a little bit longer than the others because it supports the largest. But other counties like Allegheny and Montgomery and Chester are really actually quite confident that they're going to be able to deliver results much quicker. And on ballots, I don't anticipate we'll see any widespread incidents. COOPER: When you say much quicker, do you have any sense of how long it may be before we know the results in Pennsylvania?

Carlos, I`m really curious to see what happens here because this is something that has haunted Tom ever since. I am wondering how he can possibly even explain this away other than to say, ""Oops, sorry, I was just kidding,"" which we know is not going to happen. DIAZ: Well, this is a tough one, A.J. because he can`t compromise his beliefs. He can`t say, ""I was just kidding. What was I thinking? Oh, wow."" You know, he has to stick by his beliefs. But he also can`t sit there with Oprah and say, the same things he said in the, in the fashion that he said to Matt Lauer. So there`s got to be a happy medium where he can kind of say, ""Hey. You know, this is what I believe. Maybe the manner in which I said it wasn`t the nicest way I should have said it. It is the way I believe."" And you know, maybe, just saying, ""I should have been a little more tactful in the way that I said it."" HAMMER: Yes. It is the way he believes in Scientology, obviously a huge part of his personality. We also remember there was that very controversial video of Tom, recruiting for the Church of Scientology that leaked on to the Internet not that long ago. We also learned Tom`s going to be talking to Oprah quite a bit about Scientology. This is a real opportunity to demystify his religion, Maggie, as far as I`m concerned. And he kind of has to do it, doesn`t he? GALLANT: He does. He needs to break it down for us. What is the religion all about? Why are they so against these medications? And I think to Carlos` point, he needs to get us to understand where those kinds of comments came from. He needs to not offend the parents anymore that have their children on Ritalin, and have their kids in therapy and all of these things to help these kind of behavioral issues and get us back to the understanding why he was saying this so he could become relatable. HAMMER: Tom was so relatable at one time. And yes, this is a real chance for him to become even more likable once again. I hope he pulls it off.

You know, you see this a lot with news stories, where certain news outlets essentially attach themselves to the story. And, basically, the reason they`re doing it is because it gives them exclusivity. And we`re clearly seeing this with the NBC properties. ""Access Hollywood"" has the exclusives with Larry Birkhead. So that way they`re getting access to breaking the stories. And the interesting thing about this deal, which is being reportedly estimated at about between $1 million and $1.4 million, is that it`s not limited to just ""Access Hollywood,"" but also sort of sister NBC properties, including the Bravo network. LALAMA: Oh, my goodness. Yes, thanks to cable, now they`ve got to split it all up. It`s a lot harder, isn`t it? CAPLAN: Exactly. LALAMA: Gloria Allred, great attorney and child advocate, does the money stuff stink? Does it taint the whole process? Does it make people lose credibility? ALLRED: I don`t think so. I mean, he is the father. He can decide what`s best for his baby. And it is certainly going to help the lifestyle of the baby and the child, as the child gets older, if he has the money to support her and to give her a better lifestyle. So I don`t really have any problem with that, as long as he is a good father. And it appears that he is going to be a great, loving father, and he wants his baby. He`s fought for this baby. I think he`s going to take care of this baby, and I wish her the best and all the money that he can get for her. LALAMA: Absolutely. Well, my understanding is that the deal he made with NBC, which is around $1 million, was to pay for his lawyer fees. And I have it on good authority that, when Debra Opri, his first attorney, took the case, she said, ""Look, Larry, I`ve got to get paid for all this. I`m going to be going back and forth, so I`m going to get you a good media deal."" I have no problem with that. Like you, Gloria, I say, if you can feed the baby and put some good shoes on your feet, why not? The ""OK"" deal, we`re told, he`s putting that money in a fund just for Dannielynn. Bethany Marshall, when you grow up in this kind of environment, what`s in store for this little baby girl? And how do we keep her sane, for heaven`s sakes? MARSHALL: Well, I think what`s difficult is that she`s had to reassign attachment a number of times, I mean, from the mother. She had two caretakers, now, when she was with the mom in the Bahamas.

So then, what did the White House do after the news became public on Tuesday? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SANDERS: Within 24 hours his resignation had been accepted and announced. We announced a transition was going to happen and within hours it did. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: The White House would like you to believe that as soon as they learned about the allegations against Rob Porter that he was kicked out. That is not true. Here are the facts again. The chief of staff, John Kelly, praised Porter in a statement on Tuesday crafted with help from Porter's current girlfriend, communications director Hope Hicks. Quote, ""Rob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor, and I can't say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante and trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him."" OK? And on Wednesday, Sarah Sanders after saying the president and his chief of staff had full confidence in Porter's performance announced that he would be leaving the White House, but in her words, it's her words, would stay on to ensure a smooth transition going forward. And where was President Trump in all this? Uncharacteristically silent today. Leaving Sanders to read a statement she said was dictated by the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SANDERS: The president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: Why won't he say it? That sounds nothing at all like the president's own words about Porter last Friday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We wish him well. He worked very hard. I found out about it recently, and I was surprised by it. But we certainly wish him well. It's a -- obviously, a tough time for him. As you probably know, he says he is innocent. And I think you have to remember that. He said very strongly yesterday that he is innocent. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: And then there is this. The president again, in his own words, tweeting this on Saturday. OK. These are his own words. ""People's lives are being shattered and destroyed by mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is new recovery -- there is no recovery for someone falsely accused. Life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as due process?"" Well, the president doesn't mention Rob Porter there, but, as he so often does, he is eager to defend the accused. And despite the statement he had Sarah Sanders read today, President Trump has completely failed to support two women making credible allegations of domestic violence.

And they selected 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. She's a pediatric cancer survivor, she's also a current physician's assistant, to go on this trip. She knew nothing about space. Never even thought about going into orbit. And now here she is. There's also Sian Proctor, she's a geology professor, a painter, a poet. She applied to be an astronaut back in 2009. Didn't quite make the cut. She was devastated. Now she got to achieve her lifelong dream. And then there's Chris Sembroski, who's an engineer. He was watching the Super Bowl last year and saw a commercial for Inspiration 4. He entered a raffle. His friend got the golden ticket but couldn't go, so gave it to him. And so that's how this kind of hodgepodge crew ended up together. And you know, by doing something like that, a raffle, an online contest, it entered into the equation a big element of risk. I mean, what if this crew didn't get along? But it turns out, after about five and a half, six months of training, they became very close. They climbed Mt. Rainier together, they did so many simulators together, and they say that they really became a family. And so, yes, anytime you're going into space, it is incredibly risky. But SpaceX felt very confident that they had a safe vehicle. This is now the fourth crewed mission that SpaceX has launched into space. And of course, this comes after this nearly decades-long desert of U.S. astronauts being launched from U.S. soil after the retirement of the space shuttle fleet. So truly, we're witnessing this new era of space travel and really, you know, I've been down to a lot of launches. This is the very first launch that I've been to, first crewed launch where NASA really had no role in it whatsoever because, as you said, no NASA astronauts on board -- Pam. BROWN: So what does this mean for them? I mean, they can't really call themselves astronauts, though, even though they went through this mission, right? Or can they? FISHER: Well, they're going to call themselves astronauts. SpaceX is going to call them astronauts -- BROWN: I mean, yes, they can call themselves but from a -- yes. (LAUGHTER) BROWN: And they should. FISHER: From a very technical standpoint, and this is the subject to have great debate, it is up to the FAA to issue your official government-issued commercial astronaut wings. And the FAA says that it still has not decided really what to do about this crew and about Jeff Bezos' crew and Richard Branson's crew.

CABRERA: Evangelical Christians are supporting Moore, and you cite this in your article as hypocrisy. But liberals, while foaming at the mouth about Moore, they're not necessarily speaking out as adamantly against Al Franken and John Conyers. Do you see an equivalency there? KRISTOF: So -- you know, I think everybody is engaging in some political tabulations. And, you know, I do think that Al Franken's issues in particular or allegations are somewhat less grave. In the case of John Conyers, we don't really know exactly what they are. But I think it's deeply troubling that government money, that taxpayer money may have been spent, $30,000, on a settlement, confidential settlement to end some charges. And I would hope that Conyers would release that staff member from that agreement. But, you know, basically, I think it's problematic when each side is saying, look, your molester is worse than my molester. And that's kind of what it's coming down to, that everybody is making these political calculations and saying that the other guys are worse. CABRERA: Let's hear what Senator Tim Scott, a Republican, had to say about Moore and the test that this really has created for the party and for the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM SCOTT (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: It is pretty clear to me that the best thing that Roy Moore can do for the country is to move on. The reality of it is that the allegations are so very strong and credible, and the denial has been weak. Gotten a little stronger, but it is still fairly weak. So in my opinion and in the opinion of many Republicans and conservatives in the Senate, it is time for us to turn the page because it is not about partisan politics. It's not about electing Republicans versus Democrats. This is about the character of our country. I want to be on the side of right when history writes the story. (END VIDEO CLIP) CABRERA: Nicholas, do you think that's how Republicans in Alabama feel? Do they share those same feelings we've just heard articulated? KRISTOF: So I think that Alabama Republicans are genuinely troubled by the charges against Roy Moore. And I think there's also a sense of embarrassment at the way Alabama time after time has kind of -- becomes the butt of jokes, but I think there are also a lot of Alabama Republicans who care deeply about judges and about abortion issues, and are weighing those issues against each other.

1746880,2062619,CNN,New Day,"(COMMERCIAL BREAK) JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: This weekend will be anything but relaxing for Senate Republicans on a little bit of rocky road to repealing Obamacare. The Republicans cannot afford to lose any more votes on the revised health care bill so where do the issues lie in this new version? We want to discuss this with one of the original architects of Obamacare, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel. He is the chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of ""Prescription for the Future: The Twelve Transformational Practices of Highly Effective Medical Organizations."" A very catchy title there. Doctor, let me put up on the screen some of the big changes to the new Republican version here. An option for cheaper plan with fewer benefits -- we're going to talk about that -- HSA payment allowance on premiums, $45 billion for substance abuse/opioid treatment. No changes to Medicaid from previous bill, really. No repeal on Obamacare taxes for the wealthy. The first item on that list, the so-called Cruz amendment. The option for a cheaper plan with fewer benefits. What would that change do? EZEKIEL EMANUEL, CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL ETHICS AND HEALTH POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, AUTHOR, ""PRESCRIPTION FOR THE FUTURE: THE TWELVE TRANSFORMATIONAL PRACTICES OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS"": First of all, that makes this bill even worse than the original bill that Mitch McConnell proposed because this will totally destroy the individual insurance market. Here's what happens. In the exchanges where there are these packages that have to have the 10 essential benefits, they'll have people who have illnesses or who are older will purchase there. But young, healthy people who want a skinny package will go outside the exchanges and they will get these very skinny packages. The result is you have this so-called adverse selection where only the sick are in the exchanges. They drive the premiums up because they tend to use more health care and that -- the exchanges collapse. The insurance companies hate this for that reason and, basically, it benefits young, healthy people who can pick and choose and decide when they're going to actually get real insurance. And it adversely affects people who are over 50, people who've had any illness. It totally undercuts the pledge by the president and Republicans to keep the so-called preexisting disease exclusion there. So my patients who have cancer, they're going to -- you're going to say yes, you could get insurance in the exchange but it will way too expensive for them. This does not do anything about affordability for precisely the people who need affordability. BERMAN: Right, but you're saying it makes it worse. You are saying it makes it worse -- EMANUEL: Yes. BERMAN: -- for people with preexisting conditions. EMANUEL: Because it will end the insurance market. BERMAN: Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. But it does help. It would make premiums cheaper for younger people, for healthier people,",0.0586114067971799,2017-07-14
2023334,2340123,CNN,Erin Burnett Outfront,"because Barr did know that the Special Counsel's team felt his memo did not adequately portray Mueller's findings, because he had already in fact received a letter from Mueller which said that Barr's memo, quote, did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of the Special Counsel's work and conclusions. Out front now former Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for National Security Carrie Cordero, former Federal Prosecutor Jack Weiss, former Assistant Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security under President Obama, Juliette Kayyem and former Adviser to Four U.S. Presidents, David Gergen. Jack, you're here with me so let me start with you. We just laid out the testimony. The pause. The answer which, obviously runs counter to the letter we know he had already received. Is it laughable to say Barr lied under oath? JACK WEISS, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, when I was an Assistant U.S. Attorney, if I'd gone into federal court with his special mixture of 90 percent misleading and 10 percent literal truth, regardless of whether it's perjury or not, those judges would have called my boss, the U.S. Attorney. They would have wanted my head. I would have been disciplined or fired. And I guarantee you that each and every trial lawyer in the U.S. Department of Justice feels the same way. None of them are going into federal court acting the way Bill Barr did when he went into Congress. BURNETT: Juliette? JULIETTE KAYYEM, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: I would totally agree with that assessment. There's no way you look at that testimony and think, ""Oh, there's a guy who wants full disclosure."" And I think there's two ironic aspects of this and the first is just how wounded the Attorney General feels. He's like, ""Oh, they're hurting my feelings."" He's the Attorney General of the United States. He could tell the truth and he could not try to stall any investigation into the Mueller report. The second thing quickly which makes me more nervous today than this clip that you showed was, of course, when Barr was unable to say whether the President had directed him to start investigations because since that testimony we now see a Department of Justice which is turning against and turning it's wrath so to speak on political enemies of Donald Trump. BURNETT: So Carrie let's listen to how Barr has changed his tune on another important issue which is whether the and Mueller investigation as what the President calls it, of course, which is a witch hunt. So here's Barr in January and Barr today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARR: I don't believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt. HEMMER: Are you comfortable using those words, witch hunt, hoax? BARR: I use what words I use and it was an investigation, but I think if I had been falsely accused I'd be comfortable saying it was a witch hunt.

And we're standing by for information of the fate of seven people on board a tourist helicopter that went down in Hawaii. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KEILAR: We're waiting word on the fate of seven people on board a tourist helicopter that crashed on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. The wreckage was found just a short time ago after an urgent search for the missing chopper went on for hours. Authorities are still looking for possible survivors at the crash site in a state park there. Two of the passengers were children. The Coast Guard says weather conditions were challenging, with low visibility and blustery winds when the helicopter vanished. In New York City tonight, officials are responding to a disturbing series of possible anti-Semitic hate crimes. CNN's Polo Sandoval has more now from New York. Tell us what's going on there, Polo. POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Brianna, the numbers, they are deeply disturbing. Seven reported anti-Semitic incidents in just a week here in New York City. In fact, two of them happened today. In one, three women claiming they were slapped by a woman in Brooklyn. Police say the female suspect told detectives she simply did it because they were Jewish. In another incident, a man walked into the global headquarters of the religious movement Chabad in Brooklyn, and allegedly threatened to shoot and kill people inside the center. And tonight, the search is on for that individual. Four other incidents took place on December 23rd and on the 24th. Also, being investigated by NYPD's hate crime task force. In fact, you're looking at surveillance video of one of them. It captures the attack on Christmas Eve and you can see the man in religious attire being attacked from behind in Brooklyn. And then yesterday, a Jewish mother reported being verbally and physically assaulted with a bag while she was with her child. So what's in all this? Regional director for the Anti-Defamation League told me he worries people are simply becoming more numb to this kind of behavior because it's happening so frequently.

So this is the first document that we've seen that shows that Trump was involved in what Giuliani was doing, if anyone were to argue that Giuliani was freelancing, so to speak. We've also seen -- and this is where it's a dark turn that we've learned through the text messages. SCANNELL: There's a new person who entered this, Robert Hyde. He's a candidate for a congressional seat in Connecticut. He exchanged text messages with Lev Parnas, where he suggests he is surveilling Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador at that time, as they were discussing that she needed to go, she needed to be fired. And through the text messages he's talking about that they know that she's had visitors. It looks like she made three phone calls and he says her phone and computer have turned off. It raises a lot of questions of why and how he knew this information. And there's another exchange with Hyde and Parnas where Hyde says something about money and if they want us to do something, we can do it. That has the hint of some kind of nefarious plot. There are no additional details. As we're talking about witnesses and documents, you heard earlier from the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who led the investigation, Adam Schiff, talk about the importance of having documents like the ones they have in their turning over. Let's listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Witnesses may tell the truth and witnesses may not tell the truth. Documents don't generally lie. And in the documents that we submitted to the Judiciary Committee just last night, you see the importance of documents because included among the Parnas documents is a letter from Giuliani, trying to set up a meeting with the president of Ukraine, Zelensky, to discuss a particular matter. (END VIDEO CLIP) SCANNELL: And you see there with Schiff, focusing in on this one letter we saw last night. This is part of a very large document dump that the team has given to the House. They're still culling through that. It remains to be seen if we're going to learn more information, new revelations. We don't know at this stage. ANDERSON: All fascinating stuff.

The kids, they have been put in this situation by the migrants and their families, and they have the right intentions. But often they have the wrong expectations, and that is unfair. The process is unfair, but that type of provocation is unfair as well. You're going to see more mass caravans because it is known that our system allows people to apply for asylum no matter how they get in. That's something Congress has to address. Either they have to address it and change the requirements, or they have to equip the system for the requirements and have the judges and the case agents and the accommodations to justify the flow that they're demanding. The kids we focused on, why? Because first of all they're being marginalized. You're being told that these are mostly young men. Go and look for yourself. It's at least 20%, if not more. And then you have your mothers, and you have other women there. And of course you have a lot of young men. You have a lot of breadwinners and people with dreams and people who are trying things that they'll probably never achieve in the current situation. And it all breaks your heart. And the injustice may break your spirit. And that feeling does not leave when you assess this side of the border. The system is too easy to exploit. If you have false claims, it's too easy, and it's too difficult to negotiate for those who have legitimate ones. Congress must do its damn job. Stop saying you're going to do it and do it. And stop dreaming about this comprehensive reform when you can't get one thing done. Deal with the urgency. Deal with the immediacy. Build from there. That's practical thinking. That's reasonable.

You're responsible for what we saw today, what we just showed all of you. Left and right must be reasonable. Think about fixing, not finding fault with your perceived opponent. You look at the laws. You address how you keep families, how you justify asylum. Have those laws reflect your capabilities and not just your objectives. You don't have to let the migrants into this country to do something about how they're treated. You don't have to want them here to care about their lives. Better barriers are not barriers to compassionate treatment. We can be safe and sensitive. Head and heart makes for a reasoned approach.

They are trying to find survivors who maybe trapped. Take a look at those pictures. Just devastating. They're pulling people out of the rubble there. And the mystery surrounding who sent ricin-tainted letters to President Obama and two other officials is deepening this morning, after charges were dropped against one-time suspect Paul Kevin Curtis. The U.S. attorney handling the case says there is new information now, but are they any closer to finding who did send the poison? CNN's Victor Blackwell is following all these new developments for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Kevin Curtis calls this whole thing a nightmare. Now, he wants to get back to his family, his dog, his normal life. He was released on a bond of $25,000 on Tuesday, but now the charges have been dropped in connection with these ricin-laced letters to President Obama. Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, and Sadie Holland, a judge here in Tupelo. Now, law enforcement, they're not saying much about their investigation of the letters or of Curtis, but Curtis has said from the very beginning that he was not involved. In fact, when they came to him with questions about ricin, he didn't know what ricin was. He says",0.203996983408748,2013-04-24

Let's talk about what the American people care about. DAVID AXELROD, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The question is whether the apology was convincing. He didn't apologize to the women who he was talking about in that tape. He didn't seem particularly remorseful. And then he quickly shifted to Bill Clinton and ISIS, so that there was a sense that this was a perfunctory check the box -- TAPPER: Is this as effective as you wanted it to be? His apology?

But she didn't apologize to Kathy Sheldon who was in the audience tonight, did she? A 12-year-old rape victim who she defended or anyone else. She had the opportunity tonight and she didn't apologize. TAPPER: For the record, she was appointed by the court as a defense attorney represent -- LEWANDOWSKI: She supported that when you laugh at a 12-year-old rape victim. TAPPER: She wasn't laughing at the rape victim. LEWANDOWSKI: She did. JONES: The ""New York times"" just fact-checked you on that and said it was 100 percent false. So just move on.

Top talent from Microsoft and former colleagues of wireless pioneer Craig McCaw are forming a new wireless Internet holding company. Steve Young reports.

BRAD SILVERBERG, IGNITION CORP.: Our name, Ignition, basically relates to our hope that we're going to ignite the wireless Internet. There are lots of opportunities on a worldwide basis and we hope to participate in a number of those. YOUNG: With an ambitious agenda, the new company says it will invest globally in wireless Internet startups delivering infrastructure, services and content. It will guide new companies and even set some up where it sees opportunities. Ignition is based just down the road from Microsoft in Bellevue, Washington. SILVERBERG: We won't be competing with Microsoft. As Microsoft presents opportunities for us to make investments in companies that support what Microsoft is doing, we'll be doing that. YOUNG: Ignition says its executives made big bets on the technology tidal waves of the '90s, but the Internet has now moved beyond the tethered world of PCs. DAVID FREEDMAN, BEAR STEARNS: I don't know that anybody's ready to say that PCs are toast as much as they are to say that going forward, a lot of the instruments that are used for accessing data will end up being wirelessly enabled in one way or another.

Now, remember, it's only a few weeks ago that Kim Jong-un executed his uncle on alleged charges of treason, trying to overthrow the regime. It's also a country that has one of the worst human rights records in the world. But what Rodman is saying is that's not his job, he's not there to try and change things, he's not there to try and change the world. He says he's there for sport and not politics. But of course, the criticism is increasing. The State Department says the focus shouldn't be on basketball, it should actually be on the brutality of this regime. Now, it's just gone 7:00 in the evening Korea time, and they will just be finishing off their first full day in Pyongyang, as you say, preparing for the big day on Wednesday. Tomorrow, they will be having this exhibition game. It's believed to be Kim Jong-un's birthday. He's believed to be 31 years old. And some of the other players are saying that this could actually work like ping pong diplomacy did back in 1972. Remember, that improved the relationship between China and the United States, and they ask why not this time as well? Christine? ROMANS: There are many, though, who say that what Dennis Rodman gets his publicity and what Kim Jong-un gets is a pawn, and this all just legitimizes what is a very, a very brutal, brutal rule. HANCOCKS: Absolutely, and critics are questioning why he would want to give, basically give good publicity to the North Korean leader. Remember as well, there's actually a U.S. citizen who is still in custody, in prison in North Korea. He's been there for well over a year now, Kenneth Bae. He is a former missionary, a tour guide, and Rodman has said that he's not there to try and lobby for Kenneth Bae either. So, critics are really asking why he is there. They believe that this dictatorship, as they call it, this regime is just simply too brutal to be able to have this kind of propaganda coup. ROMANS: Yes. Paula Hancocks, thank you. In fact, Dennis Rodman kind of shrugged off Kenneth Bae when he was asked by reporters at the airport, literally shrugging off Kenneth Bae. Thank you so much Paula Hancocks in Seoul.

How is it that this campaign is actually going to reach the youth that it needs to get through to? LEWIS: Hopefully by showing them they're not alone in the problems they are dealing. There are young people all over this country that have felt exactly like they feel. And as long as we give them constructive ways to deal with those energies, they can live through it, and grow beyond it into healthy adults, who can then deal with their issues effectively. I also think that it is important for people in positions of being, quote, unquote, ""role models"" because I think kids should be their own role models, but if you give them role models to look at, I think they should be realistic role models. I have dealt with depression and all of that from the time I was about 12. So it is important for me to let people who look at me like a role model to see that role models are normal people and deal with normal issues, and are just as messed up sometimes and can get just as much help. I went to counseling when I was 15, and was kind of ashamed about it then. But grew to understand that that is really normal. And if I hadn't gotten some sort of help that, you know, I never know what could have happened to me. And look, with help, what did happen to me. So there is success stories that can be shared with young people so they can be inspired to know that there is hope; that it does seem like the darkest day of your life, but your life isn't over.

It is not the concern that it might have been, that you were probably looking at, oh, just about 24 hours ago. WILSON: That is correct. We had received about seven inches of rain over a 48 hour period and with forecasts of heavy rains to come, we were -- we were all sitting on the edge of our chair because our historic downtown area was -- is the area that does go underwater when we have a lot of rain. And then we had some sandbagging and things like that. But overnight, luckily, the rain went south of us. It missed us. So the waters have receded and we have, actually, no problems this morning and we're very pleased with that. HARRIS: Wow! Well, that's -- that's great news, Mayor Wilson. But take me back to 24 hours or so ago. You mentioned seven inches of rain in a 48-hour period. Did it force you to order some evacuations? WILSON: Actually, we were lucky with the fact that on evacuations, most of the lower lying areas in our community are not inhabited. So we didn't really have an evacuation problem. We did have water over highways and we did have some people that they were trying to go through it and we had to rescue them out of the water. Luckily there were no -- no real problems with it.

WILSON: Well, the forecast, obviously, is thanks for that there are possible -- some more heavy rains coming through the community. But luckily they come through just with enough time between the heavy rains... HARRIS: Yes. WILSON: ... that it gives the water time to -- to recede. So we don't have -- we're far enough away from the Missouri River and things like that that we -- we don't see a problem with that.

1722186,2037830,CNN,The Situation Room,"moment, Pamela. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat in the House Intelligence Committee, has just emerged from a briefing. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: ... that the president may have asked Director Comey to essentially drop the Flynn investigation. If true, this is yet another disturbing allegation that the president may have engaged in some interference or obstruction of the investigation. I think we know enough now, there's been enough alleged publicly to want to bring the director back to testify ideally in open session either before our committee or the Judiciary Committee. But he should come back to Congress and share what he knows in terms of the president's conversations with him on any of the Russia investigation. I also think that we ought to ask for the notes that were taken contemporaneously or shortly after those meetings. And, of course, if there are any tapes, as the president alleged, those should also be obtained by Congress. If necessary, I think we should subpoena them, but hopefully we can obtain any of these materials voluntarily. But on the heels of an allegation that the president himself acknowledged that he brought up in the context of whether the director would stay on as director, whether he was the subject of investigation, in the context of reports by the director, or associates of the director, that he was asked to essentially for a loyalty test to the president, and now with allegations that the president urged him to essentially drop the investigation of Michael Flynn, enough is enough. Congress really needs to get to the bottom of this. We did have an opportunity to inquire further about the reports of the discussion within the White House with the Russian foreign minister and Russian ambassador. I don't have much I can share in terms of our discussions on that. I can only say that I remain concerned about allegations that the president shared information with the Russians that was not vetted in advance by our intelligence agencies. It's one thing to do this as a product of interagency thought and deliberation about information that needs to be shared. It's another thing to do it spontaneously, impetuously, or in a way that might endanger sources of information. So, I think there is still more for us to learn in terms of whether classified information was shared with the Russians. That was an answer that General McMaster was not willing to give today, and also whether any mitigation steps need to be put in place. And I'm happy to respond to one or two questions. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) SCHIFF: Mr. Conaway and I are working together very well. And I think he has made every effort, we both are, to run the investigation in a completely nonpartisan fashion. The issues that have come up in connection with Mr. Comey are beyond merely the scope of the intelligence investigation in the Intelligence Committee.

It didn`t seem to have a very good shelf life as a marketing tool.\n \n\n KRAUS: No, I can`t say it is an effective strategy.\n \n\n OLBERMANN: Did the recording industry not realize that it was going to look like it was prosecuting Goldilocks or did\nit actually want to look like it was prosecuting Goldilocks?\n \n\n KRAUS: I don`t know. I actually think that`s a good question for them.\n \n\n I think that the real challenge here is that the music industry is in a tough spot. It blames file-sharing for most\nof its woes. It is trying to stop it. But I think the question is not one of ethics. People agree that uploading lots of songs\nis wrong. But, at the same time, we ought to ask the question of efficacy. How are we going to stop this challenge of piracy?\nAnd, certainly, suing your own customers, I don`t think, is the most effective solution.

Is there some\nsort of compromise?\n \n\n KRAUS: Well, as part of this, the recording industry is offering an amnesty program. But I actually would call that\namnesty program -- and I`m quoting somebody else here -- a sham-nesty.\n \n\n I think the recording industry is missing a major opportunity with their amnesty program, in that there are 60 million\npeople who use file- trading.

We were around the state, we have never been in New Orleans, but we are thinking about maybe trying to do that. I don`t know what the answer is, but I will say this. As a former politician, no politician at the state level or the federal level has reached out to New Orleans enough. No politician. HARRIS-PERRY: Yes. BRINKLEY: I agree with that and there`s a couple other problems. One is if you go up to the Mississippi river, to Minneapolis, St. Paul, you have about 25 or more ""Fortune"" 500 companies. And you go to New Orleans, with Entergy, and that`s about it. And that means there`s not a lot of loose cash. The city itself is broken.

BRINKLEY: You have to have good roads. HARRIS-PERRY: You got to have safety. BRINKLEY: And environment -- there`s no sense of environmental consciousness. The wetlands are still disappearing. We used to have how many football fields, every day the Gulf of Mexico is getting closer to New Orleans. And with the disappearing of the barrier islands and wetlands, when now a storm or hurricane will hit, it`s going to hit harder against those levee walls.

STUREK: We've inserted ourselves in the area where the Taliban has traditionally operated with impunity, and we've been doing that by supporting the Afghan National Army, getting out there and being with the people, and it's been successful. SADLER: But heaps of money have recently been made from these harvested opium poppies, filling the pockets of drug barons, criminals and the Taliban, cash that refuels the insurgency. STUREK: The poppy harvest that a lot of these young Taliban have participated in, in my opinion, has been harvested, and they're now moving to work for Taliban commanders in trying to interdict coalition forces and Afghan National Army forces. SADLER: The soldiers want these tough mountain people to help them track the movements of Taliban fighters. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The enemy in this area is probably attempting to do the same thing. We know that one of the things that they do is try to tell the people that they are in control in this area. SADLER: U.S. commanders think they can change that. A U.S. C130 sweeps low into this disputed valley dropping supplies for Operation Mountain Thrust to win villagers' support and squeeze the Taliban. But at dusk the Taliban mounts an unseen attack, throwing U.S. and Afghan troops into a firefight so intense they need air support. An air force A10 ends the combat with its heavy cannon. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do not take your food and we do not shoot at you. We do everything we can to make sure you are safe. SADLER: It's tough selling that U.S. logic to these doubting minds. The elders lost one of their own in the fighting and seemed to blame the United States as much as they blame the Taliban. But the Americans have another card to play. They brought the district chief with them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we will have food that you can give out to the elders, and (UNINTELLIGIBLE) that you can give to them. SADLER: Ismat Muradi (ph) is the first Kabul appointed official to visit here in decades. The chief makes his pitch over sips of tea, offering security and aid in exchange for loyalty. The elders are nervous because the Taliban kill collaborators. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you help the Taliban because you are scared and you help us for hope of your future, then over time you will see who is better. SADLER: The district chief thinks he has made a good impressio here and extends an invitation for elders to visit the provincial capital. They can have a direct relationship with the government, says Chief Muradi (ph), so after that those people will be on good terms with us.

Our man on the ground, Jonathan Freed, bundled up at DIA. Hey, Jonathan. JONATHAN FREED, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Heidi. The airport people here are telling us that they have learned what they can from experience last week. They say they had some communications problems, among other things, but they're confident that they are as ready as they can be for what is coming later today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREED (voice over): You're looking at the last 100 or so bags still sitting at United Airlines baggage claim in Denver after last week's storm. Some 5,000 travelers were stranded here for two days, most sleeping wherever they could. United alone canceled 1,800 Denver flights and says it managed to reunite most people with their bags and get them on their way within 24 hours of the airport reopening last Friday. The question is, have they cleared the place out only to have it happen all over again? Denver's mayor says if it does, despite the inconvenience, the city will not compromise safety. MAYOR JOHN HICKENLOOPER, DENVER: And we're not going to keep it open longer than is completely safe, and we're not going to open it sooner than we feel is completely safe.

As Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi`s reign seemed to be coming to an end, it was Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham offering criticism on President Obama. They complained it took the United States too long to employ the full weight of our nation`s air power. But just 18 months before the United States` effort began, McCain and Graham and Senator Joe Lieberman were meeting with Gadhafi to off the dictator their support. In August of 2009, when Obama was in office, the three senators met with Gadhafi as well as his son, who was Libya`s national security adviser. According to documents released by Wikileaks, they offered to help Gadhafi get C-130 transport aircraft and equipment needed for his own security. Quoting from the document, ""Senators McCain and Graham conveyed the United States` interest in continuing the progress of the bilateral relationship and pledged to try to resolve the C-130 issue with Congress and Defense Secretary Gates."" They even gave Gadhafi advice on how to handle bad public relations as a result of the Pan Am bombing coming home -- Pan Am bomber. Let`s bring in national affairs correspondent for ""Rolling Stone Magazine,"" Tim Dickinson. Tim, good to have you with us tonight. I appreciate your time now. This criticism that these senators were laying on President Obama comes after they were meeting with Moammar Gadhafi just months before. What do you make of that? What should we take from the story? TIM DICKINSON, ""THE ROLLING STONE"": Sure. All this has gone down the memory hole. Gadhafi was our man in North Africa. The signature of success, diplomatic success of the Bush administration was we hit Saddam and we scared Gadhafi straight. He had pledged to give up his weapons of mass destruction programs and rejoin the community of nations. And so the Bush policy and the Obama policy, up until the Arab spring, was one of engagement, one of offering inducements and sweeteners to get Gadhafi to live up to his commitments to give up his WMD and crackdown on insurgents. We call the rebels today in Benghazi and eastern Libya. This was part of that effort. So there`s plenty of hypocrisy to go around. But certainly the Three Amigos went off to Gadhafi`s ranch and had a grand old time conveying what just you were saying, an offer of military support, perhaps some civilian nuclear support, in hopes of getting -- in hopes of sweetening the relationship. Far from standing up for American families who lost loved ones in the Lockerbie Bombings, they were offering public relations advice to Gadhafi on how to play it cool when the bomber came home, so that Americans wouldn`t get upset, and the relationship wouldn`t be jeopardized.

(LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) KEILAR: That's definitely going to be a topic. BORGER: That's right. That's a point. KEILAR: Speaking of Marco Rubio, how important of a night is this for him, Jeff? ZELENY: I think it's an important night. But Marco Rubio has always excelled in really every debate. I cannot think of one debate that he's had where he hasn't sort of incrementally moved the ball along here. He is slow and steady, but he is approaching this position where he's fluent on every issue. He injects a bit of biography every chance he can. So I think tomorrow night is important for him, because he will be challenging Cruz on his voting record, as David just said, and he has the substance to back it up. But Marco Rubio is still one of those candidates who he hasn't peaked too soon, that's for sure, because he hasn't peaked yet, but he is going in that direction. And I think that tomorrow night is an important night for him, but he's performed fine throughout, so I think tomorrow he will as well. AXELROD: Here's the problem for Marco Rubio. He has tried to court each of the constituencies of the Republican Party, social conservatives, Tea Party conservatives, establishment Republicans. And he's done very well at it so far. The question is, can you ride three horses and end up as someone's first choice? And I don't know. He may end up as everybody's second choice, but he has to win somewhere. And it's not clear to me in the first four contests where that is, maybe here in Nevada. And he has to emerge here as someone's first choice. And so he may have to make some choices in this debate as to which way he orients his candidacy. KEILAR: Really quick, before I let you go, because we're negative on time. Very quickly, I want you guys to tell me who you are looking for to maybe have a moment tomorrow night. AXELROD: Well, I think Cruz will be the guy that everybody's eyes are on. The guy who I would watch that nobody would necessarily mention is Chris Christie, who has risen in New Hampshire, he's a good debater, and he's a threat to all these center-right Republicans. So he's a guy I'm going to be watching as well. BORGER: I think Rubio has to look like he can be a commander in chief. He's got to have gravitas, because he is a lot of people's second and third choice. And he's got to tell people, ""I can win somewhere,"" because that's how he's going become popular, by winning.

(END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KEENAN: More fallout from the Supreme Court's privacy rights ruling last month. A decorated Vietnam veteran who was discharged from the Army for being gay is suing to reverse his dismissal. The Purple Heart recipient claims the Texas sodomy opinion retroactively guarantees his right to privacy, which he feels the don't-ask-don't-tell policy undermines. The lieutenant colonel was discharged just eight days before his 20-year retirement date, forcing him to forfeit an estimated $1-million pension. Is this unfair or what? Absolutely he should be protesting this every chance he gets. I'm not sure about his procedural standing at this point, but it's wrong. It's just wrong to take a man's pension away under these circumstances. BLOOM: Well, I think -- I think this is the next domino to fall after Justice Kennedy's sweeping decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which said that it is demeaning to lesbians and gay men to have sodomy laws criminalizing their behavior. It's equally demeaning, I think, to discriminate against lesbians and gays, to hold them down in the military, and this is a great test case for it. SMERCONISH: Don't-ask-don't-tell is a very tolerant policy that was initiated by Bill Clinton, not the most conservative of presidents. I think the Supreme Court had a political decision and not a legal decision, and the don't-ask-don't-tell will survive. BLOOM: I don't know how you can say it's tolerant if a man loses his pension just before retirement. SMERCONISH: He shouldn't have come out of the closet. BLOOM: Oh. KEENAN: But, no, he didn't come out. He had an arson at his home, and they found the tape and turned it over. I mean this is somebody's who's -- consensual adult conduct in his home. BLOOM: Now to a textbook case for a lawsuit. Some eighth- graders skipped school to attend a party where there might have been some fooling around going on but not all that surprising. But when school officials heard about it, they decided the right punishment was a few tests for sexually-transmitted diseases and pregnancy. The students were suspended and allegedly told they would not be allowed to return until they provided a doctor's note with a clean bill of health. The girls are suing for violation of privacy. Boy, is that a great case. And what a terrible lesson to teach young girls, that medical test tests are going to be a punishment instead of positive, preventative measures in their lives. KEENAN: Where are the boys? What, they don't -- we don't care whether they have STDs, we don't care whether they can transmit diseases to other people? There's a bad message in there. SMERCONISH: The bad message is that we're all focused on the school and not on the fact that 12-year-old girls are having sex. The New York Public Schools have to have a daycare program because out-of- wedlock pregnancy is so bad. That's what we should be focusing",0.0903444752590862,2003-07-13

Ali Velshi here now ""Minding Your Business"". We see a lot of people from the private sector going into government. Usually that's a permanent position, but now you've got a temporary one. ALI VELSHI, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: This is a great idea. UPS is loaning a logistics expert to FEMA for nine months. And I think that's a fantastic idea. You'll remember after Hurricane Katrina, a lot of America's companies, particularly UPS, FedEx, Wal-Mart, a lot of these companies that have very strong logistics operations, were ready to get in there and help. And actually proved a great deal of expertise. UPS has since been involved in the earthquakes in Pakistan, the tsunami in southeast Asia. So there's this veteran UPS logistics expert who is going to be working with FEMA. UPS is going to continue to pay his salary. He has expertise in transportation, supply chain management, warehousing, distribution, things like that. CHETRY: Wow. VELSHI: This makes sense. CHETRY: It does. When you think about the tracking numbers, I mean, you can go on your computer these days, they'll... (CROSSTALK) VELSHI: That's exactly right. And during the hurricanes and times like that -- for instance, these -- Home Depot, another perfect example. They track exactly how much wood is on the trucks going to the stores that they need. So it's really smart that the government engages these companies that have this expertise. It's good for the companies, obviously, because not only is it good for their reputation, but they also get to share the expertise that they've learned. There's no point in one company or a few companies understanding this better than everyone else. ROBERTS: But here is the question. He is probably great at doing all of that with UPS' infrastructure. VELSHI: Right. And I think he's going to consult with FEMA to say, here is the infrastructure you need, here's the decision-making. One of the thing that America's companies succeed on in disasters is very fast decision-making capability. They empower the people who control the trucks to say, get the trucks where you need them to go. UPS is hopefully going to have some influence on FEMA in this case.

The state's pending or the state's public university system is going to defy what the governor of that state has said and what the state legislature has said. And instead, that university told the Department of Justice, told the federal government, ""We're with you."" But they intend to, ""Act in compliance with federal law.""

It happened late yesterday when North Carolina's Governor, Pat McCrory and the Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch had dueling new conferences to announce dueling lawsuits. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAT MCRORY, (R) NORTH CAROLINA: We believe a core rather than a federal agency should tell our state, our nation and employers across the country what the law requires. LORETTA LYNCH, ATTORNEY GENERAL: They create a state sponsored discrimination against transgender individuals who simply seek to engage in the most private of functions in a place of safety and security. A right taken for granted by most of us. (END VIDEO CLIP) BANFIELD: So there is definitely a legal view here. I want to bring in CNN Legal Analyst and Defense Attorney Danny Cevallos and Julie Rendelman, who is a defense attorney and former prosecutor. OK, you two. Imagine for a moment you're the university watching these two, you know, battle bots going at it and millions of dollars of your funding are at stake at this time, maybe not a surprise that we got the statement from Margaret Spellings she's the University of North Carolina system president.

592871,840996,CNN,The Situation Room,"WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks very much, guys. Happening now, John McCain confronts anti-war hecklers and challengers Barack Obama on Iraq. This hour, we have a tough new response from Senator Obama linking McCain to the president. We'll fact check the Democrats' claim that McCain would just be another George W. Bush. Do the two Republicans most often butt heads or do they see eye to eye on the big issues? And the Democrats face their Michigan and Florida problem. Will a weekend meeting produce a compromise the Obama and Clinton camps can both accept? I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Just a short while ago, a new attempt by Barack Obama to throw President Bush's baggage right at John McCain. This on the day Mr. Bush holds a closed-door fundraiser with the all but certain Republican nominee. Listen to Obama speaking in Nevada, a state that could be crucial in a fall match-up against McCain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Today, John McCain is having a different kind of meeting. He is holding a fundraiser with George Bush behind closed doors in Arizona. No cameras, no reporters and we all know why. Senator McCain doesn't want to be seen hat in hand with the president whose failed policies he promises to continue for another four years. Now, the question for the American people is do we want to continue George Bush's policies? CROWD: No. OBAMA: I think the answer is now, because I don't think the American people want to continue the disastrous economic policies that have helped create catastrophes like the housing crisis that we're here to discuss today. I don't think we want to continue a misguided foreign policy and an endless war in Iraq that's cost us thousands of lives and hundred of billions of dollars while making us less safe and secure. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: As for Senator McCain, he is trying today to highlight his differences with Obama on foreign policy as well as his differences with President Bush. He was heckled, though, along the way. Our White House correspondent Ed Henry is standing by. But let's go to CNN's Mary Snow. She is with Senator McCain in Denver right now. The Senator wanted to address the issue of nuclear proliferation, but as we said, he got heckled and that sort of changed at least part of what he was saying. What happened? MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, protesters interrupted him four times during his speech. The speech was on nuclear security and in that speech he did take an indirect aim at his likely Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SNOW (voice-over): Senator John McCain says neither Democrats nor Republicans have gotten it right for the past two decades when it comes to controlling the spread of nuclear weapons. For one, he wants to work more closely with Russia on nuclear disarmament. And without naming Senator Barack Obama he took an indirect swipe at",0.036399297134089,2008-05-27

And certainly they were guarded going from Marine unit to Marine unit because they looked, they said -- the Marine Corp said -- like the Japanese, perhaps, in American uniforms. So sometimes they'd be retained, and detained by their own side -- Lou. WATERS: Eileen, why has it taken so long to have this ceremony? O'CONNOR: Well, that's an interesting question. The Marine Corps said that, while the code talker were an incredible part of the victories in the Pacific theater for the Marines and the incredible battles, they were also just part of it, and that there were so many other Marines who also served and who died. And they say that they did not believe in separating one group out. So this really -- this train for recognition for them was driven by members of Congress; and that, really, is why it's taken so long -- Lou. WATERS: OK, Eileen O'Connor.

And television focuses on bolstering the personality cult of President Kim, Jong Il and his late father. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Hurray for the revolutionary ideology of Kim, Il Sung. ANDERSON: This week, North Korean television broadcast lavish celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of anti imperialist pact with China. Amid a growing international storm, the world's last Stalinist state remains committed to keeping its people on message. (END VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON: Well, I'm joined now by Vincent Brossel from Reporters without Borders. Vincent recently spent some time in South Korea on a fact finding mission interviewing North Korean journalists who had defected from the country. Those journalists that you met, why have they defected? VINCENT BROSSEL, REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS: So they defected because they have been under watch by the political police. They were maybe some - not to critical, but in the sense that maybe they have some question about the - what we call the big lies of the regimes. For example, one of the journalists we interviewed, he had some question about the fact that Kim, Jong Il was born in a very mountain, what is official version, when the truth is that he was born in Russia. So he asked some question about it. And after that, the political police started to make some investigation about him. So he thought if I don't escape to China, maybe I can be arrested and sent to a concentration camp. ANDERSON: There are, of course, international journalists working in North Korea, aren't there, at present. Just explain what sort of conditions they are working under? BROSSEL: First of all, it's very hard to get a visa. It's a long negotiation. Second, you cannot move freely. You have always two or three or four people watching you, even sleeping in the same hotels. And you, you cannot go out without authorization. You cannot speak to the people in the street without authorization. So it's very limited work, but the men - I think that there is absolutely no consequences on the North Korean population. I mean, they will never know that - I mean, the international media are interested in North Korea, but they cannot work fully on North Korea. So for example, in November 2005 when CNN decided to broadcast a special report about human rights, after that, the official news agency said be careful you will not get visa any more if you report about human rights. So you see that there is always a sort of blackmailing, and that international journalists trying to cover North Korea with more - real reports, not only going to North Korea and like a tourist, it's very, very difficult. ANDERSON: North Korea is ranked last by Reporters Without Borders with respect to press freedoms.

Among the things they are asking for in this letter is a list of students by ethnicity, by racial breakdown.

FESSIO: Well, Ignatius Press, of which I'm the editor, publishes his books in English. So I've seen the story. He's told it himself. His father was an anti-Nazi. Joseph Ratzinger himself at age 12 or 13 I think was part of the Hitler youth. But you couldn't not be part of that in those days. So he certainly had no ideological support for it, and his whole life has shown he is against the totalitarian-ness and then also nationalism. And he's worked very closely in reaching out from the Catholic Church, Chester, to Jewish leaders, and he's been instrumental in building some of those bridges, not only between the Vatican and the world Jewish community, but with Israel himself. GILLIS: Yes, and he's made numerous apologies to the Jewish community for those early years when he was misdirected by the German government, in a sense, and I think the Jewish community has certainly seen that as sincere, so I don't think he comes with a tarnished image in that regard. BLITZER: I think you're right. Father Fessio, let's talk about some other potential candidates, and this is treacherous, dangerous ground to speculate about all of this, but let's do it anyhow. Who do you see as -- assuming that Cardinal Ratzinger doesn't get it, two or three other possible candidates? FESSIO: Well, first of all, I, again, agree with Chester here, but the ones that seem most possible are the least likely to be elected. But the holy spirit is behind this. Catholics are very serene right now, because whoever is elected he'll lead the church in the footsteps of Christ. *** FESSIO: Well, first of all, I again agree with Chester here that ones that seem most possible are the ones least likely to be elected. But the Holy Spirit breathes behind this. Catholics are very serene right now, because we know whoever's elected, he'll lead the church in the footsteps of Christ, because he cannot do otherwise. But the result will be a surprise. The biggest surprise will be if it's a frontrunner. But there are many, many, cardinals who could potentially become pope. I know a few of them, and I did some reading of the biographies of the ones I don't know, and I was very pleasantly surprised to see that the ones I don't know have very similar biographies of the ones I do, which means they're good, solid men of the church. They love the lord, they're men of prayer, they're pastoral. So I think -- it doesn't matter too much who gets chosen. By the way, that's another thing. It's not the pope that's so important, it's the papacy. Even a bad pope should get selected -- even a horrible sinner. That will not destroy the Catholic Church.

So, we're talking about islands that are at midpoint there, and you can think about a tsunami, how big an effect it could have reaching out to those areas and others as well. Obviously, a big concern as soon as you hear anything about Samoa. So, Tony, that's something we're keeping an eye on here, trying to just give our viewers a little bit of perspective today as we follow this story.

Does the public option, gone for now from the bill that you're working on in the Finance Committee, does it come back in either the melding of the health bill and whatever's passed by your committee, or -- or -- out of the final conference committee bill after the House and the Senate conferree's reconcile the two bills? And don't duck me on this. WYDEN: Tony, I believe the final bill clearly will create more choices and more competition for the typical consumer. Right now that is the key to making coverage affordable. You've got a lot of middle- class families, maybe making $65,000, $66,000 a year, saying, I can't pay 19 percent or 20 percent of my income on health care. A way to hold their bills down is to create more choices. Those choices ought to be both public and private. HARRIS: What's the percentage you're going to settle on here?

Almost all of us use Facebook. We click on the links we see on Facebook, but we know very little about how the algorithm chooses what we see and what we don't see, or how they assume an editor choose what we see and what we don't see. With great power, as Facebook has, comes a lot of quasi-journalistic responsibility. And I think that's the conversation I'm hearing a lot today. People suggesting that we need to understand more about how Facebook constructs the newsfeed, how it determines what you see and what you don't see because after all they're acting a lot like a media company, even though they say they're not one. ANDERSON: Yeah. And that's a very good point, isn't it? What should we be allowed as consumers to know about how an organization like Facebook works effectively, because 600 million people getting their news at some point during the week or month is it from Facebook at any one time. I'm not sure that everybody really cares about how the actual system works, but those who do, do they have the right to know more? STELTER: That's right. That's why we're hearing journalists and academics and other industry observers speak up and say Facebook needs to be more transparent about how it works, about how the system works. I've seen some calls for an ombudsman or for a public editor, the way a newspaper like The New York Times has, in order to invite people into the process to understand the company's intentions. You know, it's been proven from studies in the past that Facebook is able encourage you to vote, to cause more people to go vote, based on what it does to the algorithm, based on what stories it shows you, and what messages it shows you. If it has the ability to do that, it also has the ability to change you in lots of other ways, maybe to encourage you not to vote, maybe make you forget it's the voting day. So, there's a lot of power that comes from the Facebook news feed. And there's increasing pressure on the company to explain how it does what it does.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WOODRUFF: Once again, we're following developments in Chesapeake, Virginia, where the jury, trying to reach a decision on what the penalty should be for Lee Boyd Malvo in those sniper shootings. Lee Boyd Malvo having been convicted in the killings of individuals back about a year ago. The jury has come back in one of the convictions, they had reached a verdict. We don't know what that verdict is. The judge turned around and told the jury to go back and try to reach sentencing decisions on the other convictions as well. Jeanne Meserve, who has been covering the trial. Jeanne, just to go back over this without confusing our viewers, because we had all believed that we were going to hear what their verdict was on the sentencing, now we know they've reached a verdict, apparently, in the sentencing on the capital murder terrorism charge, but not on the others. MESERVE: That's apparently true. The judge has sent them back, said do a little bit more work on this please. I can tell you that one factor in the jury's decision making process will be Lee Malvo's age. He was 17 at the time these crimes were committed that means that he was a juvenile. A lot of debate in this country as you know about juvenile death penalty, not all the states allow it. In fact, fewer than half allow juveniles to be executed.

Those kind of characteristics are easy to follow and it's a big void that is left in our community. TUCHMAN (voice-over): As horrifying and as violent as these crimes are. And with the gunman still on the loose, it's notable police are not asking nearby residents to take any out of the ordinary precautions. Current information reveals there is not an active threat to the public at large. And there was not a directed threat to residents of the neighborhood.

So Gary, I mean, do we know why police are indicating there's no threat to the community? TUCHMAN: Police aren't telling us Anderson, but an obvious hypothesis here is that the gunman somehow knew the first two men he shot and then targeted them. And that may be why police are not very concerned about people in the neighborhood. And it's important to stress that police also pointed out he just heard that this third man that golf pro Mr. Siller was not targeted. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Also, a lot of our viewers might be wondering, what the heck was this truck doing on the golf course? Why did that happen? That's bizarre. We don't know the answer to that.

Because I understand a couple of years ago some federal\nlaw enforcement agency was talking about the possibility of people taking in parts that they could get through security and\npossibly building bombs inside these lavatories.\n \n\n ADAMS: Well, Joe, obviously, this situation, when the air marshals were notified of it, they kept them under observation.\nThere was only one time that a gentlemen went into the first class lav. He was in there about 10 minutes. And a federal air\nmarshal went in there and he looked at the lav. Nothing was out of the ordinary.\n \n\n And then, in the rear lav, yes, they were congregating a little bit there, but other passengers were, too, nothing out\nof the ordinary, according to the flight attendants, because we interviewed all four flight attendants on this flight. But\nthe flight attendants went in the rear lav and also reported back to our federal air marshals that everything was in the norm\nand nothing was out of the ordinary.\n \n\n SCARBOROUGH: One final question. The other night, we had a gentlemen on from the Federal Air Marshals Association, but\nhe wasn`t an actual air marshal. You`re aware of all of the facts of the flight. Do you believe that the air marshals on the\nflight acted appropriately?\n \n\n ADAMS: Yes, they did, Joe.\n \n\n And it`s safe to fly. And the Department of Homeland Security looks at all these situations. And I can tell you that\nthere`s no threat to the aviation industry now. We have no information anybody is targeting our aircrafts, and it is safe\nto fly.\n \n\n SCARBOROUGH: All right, Dave, thanks a lot. I greatly appreciate it.\n \n\n And I want to get you back on to talk about the dress code that federal air marshals have, because it has a lot of people\nthinking, hey, we need to have them go undercover, instead of all dressing in sort of the same uniform.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's outrageous that the prices are that high. FOREMAN: High crude oil prices alone are not at fault. A year ago crude was close to the price it is now and a gallon of gas was under $3. Now it's around $3.20. ALI VELSHI, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The cost of distribution remained surely the same. Taxes remained roughly the same. The culprit has got to be refining. We are paying more to refine gas from oil than we ever paid before. FOREMAN: Oil industry analysts say some spectacular refinery fires knocked out a few facilities, and more importantly, ever since hurricanes Katrina and Rita, maintenance crews have been struggling to keep refineries producing. When the short supply of refineries hits the high demand of spring travelers, this is the result. Some consumer advocates say the oil companies with their record profits should have seen this coming. BRAD PROCTOR, GASPRICEWATCH.COM: Let's start taking some of those profits and pushing them into the refinery system so we can be more efficient into what we are able to convert.

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Incredibly different. From Obama, the president of the United States, you did not get the sense that this is a turning point. From France, because this happened on French soil, you get the very sense that this is a turning point, but what does that mean? BOLDUAN: He does mean three things that he laid out. He asked for a three-month extension of the state of emergency, which is remarkable. France hasn't been under this situation since the Algerian attacks way back when. A three-month extension of that, which allows for warrantless searches and the kinds of raids we saw last night. In addition to that, he wants the power to strip suspected terrorists of French citizenship, which is not something that exists right now. So he's asking for more power now to fight terrorism here now. AMANPOUR: That's exactly right.

He chose to laugh off the question. He was dismissive about it, turned his head, didn't get involved in this discussion, which he doesn't have to get involved in this discussion. It's probably not a good discussion to get involved with all together. Instead he focused on the real problem, the problem that affects every day American people.

SOUCIE: Right. CABRERA: Would we be able to see some of the changes if they were to make some tweaks? SOUCIE: You will absolutely. There's some you will see and there are some that you won't. There's a few that you get procedurally. There'll be things that change as part of the way that the security works as you have certain screenings on certain passengers. So as you move it through you have not do the same thing for every passenger because obviously that could be detected by the terrorists and they would adapt to that mechanism. So you have to continually change it, continually upgrade it, continually respond and assess whether what you're doing is working or not and then improve that. So as I said it's very -- it's a very reactive type of security measure. And that's really all they can do. They can look for it, they can get the information, the intelligence like they have now, about the fact that they have these screening machines. But now there's another level, there's something else that has to go and that can get very expensive as well and difficult to react to quickly. CABRERA: We don't know the details about how these terrorist groups may have gotten their hands on the screening equipment. Do you hear of that stuff being stolen? Is that something that can go missing? Help us understand what this screening equipment really is. SOUCIE: Well, the screening equipment, I can't really tell too much about what the screening equipment is. However, what is missing, there's no full set of security equipment that's missing right now. It's all serialized, catalogued, and very well taken care of. What the difficulty is when parts or pieces of the equipment can be purchased like replacement parts, for example. CABRERA: OK.

Wolfowitz said the planners have gotten a little too imaginative. Just last hour a federal judge in California struck down a portion of California's recall law. The ruling apparently will not halt the October 7 recall election, but will change the way ballots are counted. The law had held that Californians would have to vote yes or no on the recall question in order to cast a vote on a possible successor to Governor Gray Davis. But the judge ruled they that they did not have to take a position on the recall for their choice of successor to count. It will be up to the secretary of state's office whether to appeal the ruling. California's top Democratic strategists are meeting in San Francisco to brainstorm ways to bail the governor out of his recall mess. The powwow was organized by San Francisco Willy Brown. At the table at least three top Davis advisers, including the governor's political guru Gary South. And one of the '04 Dems is adding his voice to the debate. Al Sharpton says he'll go to California to fight the recall forces. The question on everybody's lips: will Arnold run? It is looking increasingly unlikely and Republicans are shifting to Plan B. Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who ran in the GOP gubernatorial primary last year, is starting to put together a campaign team. And he may have the White House's blessing.

But now apparently Bristol Palin through her attorney is asking for financial papers of Levi Johnston that he's been paid for ""Playboy"" and a number of print, as well as broadcast exposure and so she wants some proof of the pudding that he should be able to help pay for their child. Richard, where's this going? HERMAN: Well, it's going to family court, that's where it's going. I mean, he's in arrears almost $20,000. He's claiming whatever that he has the money, or he doesn't have it. He's ordered to pay $1,600 a month in support. He's claiming he doesn't have the money and yet, he did this photo shoot for ""Playgirl,"" he's been on entertainment shows, he's obviously receiving some money for that... WHITFIELD: For at least one shoot, wasn't there a $100,000 figure attached to at least one of the shoots? HERMAN: Yeah, I know his mother has some major legal fees going on these day, but I don't know, Fred. You know, they're going to investigate his assets. What is he, 18 year old? You know, I don't know where it's going. He's going to be under scrutiny... FRIEDMAN: Actually, I think I see where it's going. The fact is, it's in a little court in Alaska, his attorney is now subpoenaing, issues subpoenas to news organizations including CNN, claiming that he was paid for this. Well, news organizations generally do not pay. He's incurring expensive overwhelming legal expenses, as is Bristol, because they'll have to go to New York and Atlanta. It's silly. All they have to do is compel Levi to produce the evidence. That's all. WHITFIELD: And I wonder if this one way the Palin family also trying to compel Levi Johnston to start being quiet. You know? Kind of hit him in the pocketbook? FRIEDMAN: Yeah, it backfired. It backfired. WHITFIELD: OK, well, later on we're going to see you guys again in our part deus.

I think it's a valid analytical insight that everything is connected, but in terms of being able to operationalize it, given realities on the ground, given problems in the Arab/Israeli arena, with the Hamas in charge of the Palestinian Authority; and given the fact that right now, Syria and Iran are part of the problem -- and not part of the solution in Iraq -- I'm not sure that this is an option that we can really go forward with, at this time. ROBERTS: In terms of the interconnectedness of all of this. Do either Iran or Syria have the power -- if they so wanted -- to stop the violence in Iraq? EISENSTADT: My feeling is that they have the power to fan the flames, but not to stop the violence. There are enough weapons, there's enough fighters, there's enough money in Iraq, right now, to keep the violence going almost indefinitely. ROBERTS: Ed Henry, this idea of a major diplomatic offensive, that the Iraq Study Group talks about, shows us the real stark difference between Baker diplomacy and Rice diplomacy. Who is President Bush going to be more loyal to? The man who helped him become president in the year 2000, or the woman who has been charge of foreign policy? HENRY: That was then, this is now. The bottom line is he's more loyal now to the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice than he is to James Baker. Baker was his father's secretary of State. We have heard all of the people putting the president on the couch about whether he's going to ignore the advice of his father's advisors, or what not. The president not going to play that game, obviously. But the bottom line is, he's loyal to Condoleezza Rice. That's who has got him here, in the last couple of years, in terms of shaping foreign policy. And while it has just gotten slapped, they want to try and rebuild this, and figure out how to move forward. ROBERTS: Michael Eisenstadt, how much of any of this report do you think President Bush will adopt in his policies? EISENSTADT: I think, first of all, the president will probably say that some of the ideas are things that we're already doing now -- or that we were about to do -- such as embedding of troops. That's an area where the military was heading that direction. There will be other things that I think that they will incorporate. But I think it will be a mixed bag. I think that's unrealistic to think that he won't accept all the recommendations. There are more than 70 of them, there. ROBERTS: Well, the president is promising something by Christmas. Next week he'll spend a few days listening so we'll see what he comes up with. Ed Henry, Michael Eisenstadt, thanks. Coming up, one U.S. senator",0.4377877877877877,2006-12-10

WALKER: All right, Joe Johns, appreciate you, thank you very much. The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for a new COVID-19 test that looks for a different type of immunity. BLACKWELL: It's the T-Detect COVID test. It looks for evidence of cellular immunity or t-cells in people who have had the virus, and experts say that's a longer lasting type of immunity than antibodies. Scientists do not know how long immunity lasts in people who have been affected with COVID-19. WALKER: Let's get now to CNN's Evan McMorris-Santoro. Hi there, Evan. We're also learning that the U.S. could reach herd immunity by this summer. What more can you tell us? EVAN MCMORRIS-SANTORO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Amara. This is a new CNN analysis of the vaccine, its rollout, and what that means for the rest of the country. The CDC says about 2 million doses of vaccine are going into people's arms every day here in America, and according to our numbers, that means that could mean we could reach herd immunity in this country by the end of the summer, which is pretty nice to hear. Let me show you some graphics that get into this a little bit. Currently 8.8 percent of the American population has been fully vaccinated according to those CDC numbers. As you can see on screen, herd immunity is very, very far away from 8.8 percent. But with those vaccines continuing to go into people's arms, the numbers hopefully will close up pretty quickly and we'll see that herd immunity before the end of the summer, which is great to hear. Right now, we're I'm standing in Manhattan, warm weather feels a very long way off, but it really isn't that far. So it's one of those reason that people are saying America needs to keep the pressure, keep the focus on masks, social distancing, doing the right thing, because this vaccine is actually having an impact and it really could have a very, very big impact very soon. BLACKWELL: Evan McMorris-Santoro for us, thank you. WALKER: Joining me now to talk about all of this is CNN medical analyst Dr. Jorge Rodriguez. Appreciate you joining me, good morning you to. DR. JORGE RODRIGUEZ, INTERNAL MEDICINE AND VIRAL SPECIALIST: Good morning, Amara. WALKER: So first off, let's talk about this COVID-19 test that looks to see if someone may have had COVID-19 by looking for a longer lasting type of immunity that involves immune system cells. Can you talk to us a little bit more about that and how that works? RODRIGUEZ: Sure. That's a pretty complicated test, if you will. Having been someone that has worked with HIV patients for the last 30 years, when your body meets a virus, it makes many, many different types of antibodies. And it also sparks up a different part of your immune system called the t-cells. And",0.1721866096866097,2021-03-06

Three mobile homes were destroyed and tornadoes also were reported in several other western and northern Alabama counties. Thousands of Texas evacuees are heading home. Officials have asked some to wait a little longer until it's safe. And in Houston, they're trying to stagger the return. That's in an effort to avoid a repeat of the gridlock we saw last week when people headed out of town. CNN national correspondent Bob Franken is in Houston. He's live there this morning. And I see some traffic behind you -- Bob. BOB FRANKEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the key word there was trying to stagger. I think the response was basically yes, right, I'm going home. And so there's been a steady stream. We took a little tour of Houston last night and it looked like it was coming back to normal. What was coming back to normal was the presence of gasoline. The lines weren't all that long at service stations. We're just maybe 100 yards from one here and there are no cars there, even though there is gasoline. People are coming back. They're coming back to a city that has some power problems. This is a city of, a metro area of over four million. About 300,000 homes and businesses are still without electricity and they're working feverishly to return things to normal there, because the temperatures are at the 100 degree mark. As a matter of fact, the heat index has been a little bit above that. So the absence of air conditioning is a real hardship. Officials are still hoping that some people take their time. They've delayed the opening of schools a little bit. They've asked that all but essential personnel not be ordered back to work by their employers. But so far things have gone smoothly. There have been some traffic backups, but oftentimes they're associated with the usual kinds of things that you find on highways and streets, that is to say, somebody not driving properly or people rubbernecking, that kind of thing. But, it's certainly nothing compared to that massive gridlock they had on the way out, the evacuation that has caused so much criticism. Although officials say while it was not needed, had it been needed, an awful lot of people who suffered on the highways at least would have been out of harm's way -- Carol. COSTELLO: Yes, we were just looking at a shot of a traffic accident. It looked minor to me. And there weren't many slowdowns behind it. You know, the biggest concern is people don't believe the government when they say we have a plan and we're going to stagger traffic, come back at these different times. They're just ignoring the order, which makes you think of the future and when will people ever trust their government again to get it right?

QUESTION: Could I ask you both how soon realistically you think there could be an end to the violence, given there's no signs at the moment of 1559 being met? I mean, do you think we're looking at more weeks, months, or (inaudible) sooner than that? And also, will the multi-national force potentially be used to effect a cease-fire, or simply to police an agreement once we eventually get to that? BLAIR: Well, I think that the answer to the first point is: as soon as possible. And if we can get the U.N. resolution agreed next week and acted upon, then it can happen. And it can happen then. I mean, you know, we want to see it happen as quickly as possible, but the conditions have got to be in place to allow it to happen. And in relation to the multi-national force, now what will be -- it's not going to be the opportunity to fight, you know, to fight their way in, but the very way that you pose that question underlines this basic point, which is: This can only work if Hezbollah are prepared to allow it to work. And we've got to make sure, therefore, that we have the force go in as part of an agreement that the government of Lebanon have bound itself to, the government of Israel have bound itself to, the international community has bound itself to. And Hezbollah have got to appreciate that if they stand out against that, then it's not merely that they will be doing a huge disservice to the people of Lebanon, but they will also, again, face the fact that action will have to be taken against them. BUSH: We share the same urgency of trying to stop the violence. That's why Condi Rice went out there very quickly. Her job is to -- first and foremost, was to make it clear to the Lebanese people that we wanted to send aid and help, and help work on the corridors necessary to get the aid to the Lebanese people. And she's coming back to the region tonight; will be there tomorrow. I mean, I could've called her back here and could've sat around, visited and talked. But I thought it was important for her to go back to the region to work on a United Nations Security Council resolution. So, like the prime minister, I would like to end this as quickly as possible, as well. Having said that, I want to make sure that we address the root cause of the problem.

A conservative Confederate flag wearing commentator who would write longingly about avenging the South. ""John Wilkes Booth was right."" John Wilkes Booth, of course, assassinated Abraham Lincoln. So says the Southern Avenger, quote, ""I raise a personal toast to every May 10th to celebrate John Wilkes Booth`s birthday."" When Rand Paul was called out for having this guy ghost write Rand Paul Tea Party manifesto book, Senator Paul`s defense for having the toasting the Lincoln assassin guy as his paid ghost writer, was that all of that Confederate stuff from that guy was sort of a youthful indiscretion. Can no one do dumb things in their youth that they grow out of as adults? The problem with that defense was it turns out it was only a few months before Rand Paul hired him that the Southern Avenger was still defending in print the virtues of southern secession. So, the confederate flag wrestling mask unrepentant Confederate toasting the assassination of Lincoln, him being hired by Rand Paul to ghost-write his book, that used to be the controversy about Rand Paul as an author.

We're going begin tonight though with two prisoners who have broken out, literally broken out of jail. They meticulously scratched through a wall until they loosened a concrete block. And then they jumped to their freedom over a barbed wire fence. What a story. Here's Jason Carroll. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jose Espinosa was looking at 17 years for manslaughter. Otis Blunt was facing robbery and weapons charges. Together, they hatched a plan to chip their way out of doing hard time. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm angry that two prisoners would escape a secure facility and not even know when they did it. CARROLL: Guards noticed both inmates missing from their high- security cells at the Union County Jail at 5:15 p.m. Saturday. They found this metal wire and say they believe Blunt used it as a tool to chip away a hole into Espinosa's adjoining cell. Then they used it to chisel an 18-inch-wide hole from Espinosa's cell to the outside. The holes were concealed with pinup posters. If their plan sounds a little familiar, that's because that's basically what a character in the critically acclaimed film ""The Shawshank Redemption"" did to escape. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I really prefer not to compare it with any movie, although I can understand why you might, because it does -- to a certain degree, it does look very similar to some of them, except I think, in ""Shawshank Redemption,"" they had a better poster on the wall. CARROLL: In the movie, the character crawls through a sewer pipe to freedom. Blunt and Espinosa took a different path. The hole they created opened up to third-floor landing. And once outside, authorities say they presumably took a running jump 15 feet out, clearing a razor-wire fence and landing 30 feet below.

I'm also going to show you how to take it off which some say is the most dangerous part. I will point out as we start to do this, I work in an operating room every week. This is different than what most doctors I think are used to, at least in the operating room. I do want to point out this a little different than how I suited when I was in Guinea but we're following CDC protocol. I want to show you how I'll take this protective equipment off and I'm also going to put chocolate sauce in my hand which could represent a possible Ebola contamination. Take a look. This is the mask, so here would be the most likely contaminated area, my gloves, maybe the front of my gown a bit like this. Now I got to treat this as if I'm potentially contaminated. I come out, what I'll do with this gown, rip it off together, and everything's going to come off simultaneously. Part of the glove brushed against my hand, my arm there, that could potentially be an exposure. If the glove didn't come off properly, I would reach underneath here as best I could and get underneath there. But perhaps if I didn't do it exactly right, there could be another potential exposure there. I'm reaching behind as well as I can but let's say the side of my face shield was contaminated and I touched here, that could be an exposure. Same thing here now with the face mask. Now take a look. Right there, see a little bit of chocolate sauce, one possible exposure and over here on my neck, one possible exposure. (END VIDEOTAPE) CAMEROTA: Sanjay, that was fascinating. Thanks so much for that demonstration. So you determined that there were, what, two, three, four possible exposures, even with all the protective gear? GUPTA: Yes, and just relatively small steps that people might not think about, again you have to assume that the front of your gown, your gloves are the contaminated area, and then you reach behind to take things off. What if you don't reach behind far enough and touch something? It was interesting.

So, don't be too concerned about this weakening because ultimately, you still need to be prepared for a major hurricane. All right. This should be an updated track then for you too. You can see it continuing to make the northerly turn heading to the Carolinas late tonight or tomorrow morning, and then heading on up to the Northeast coast. There you can see, it all pretty much keeps it on shore now. So, I think we are looking at two landfalls. So, this continues to be a developing situation. That forecast track looking more certain and unfortunately, more dangerous for the Carolinas as well as much of the Northeast. Jim. ACOSTA: Jacqui, thanks so much.

1391439,1705880,CNN,Amanpour,"millions, thousands of Muslims all over the world. And in France, many people are shocked because they think that there's a line. And drawing the Prophet ""Charlie Hebdo"" crossed once again this line. I'm not sure it was a good moment for that. AMANPOUR: OK. I asked you wasn't it the only moment to do this now. And I asked you, you say they should have said this is not Islam. Surely the ""Je suis Charlie"" and ""Tout est pardonne,"" all is forgiven, means precisely that. MESSAOUDENE: No. It means that Islam has something to be forgiven for and the Prophet can't wear a ""Je suis Charlie"" banner because the Muslims can't be -- can't agree with all that ""Charlie Hebdo"" says or draws. So I think that the main mistake is to draw the Prophet and to make him wear this banner of ""Je suis Charlie."" I think this is a miss and putting the Prophet is making a link between terrorism and Islam. AMANPOUR: Let me turn to Sara Khan here in the studio. Do you agree? Did he -- did you think that this was provocative of ""Charlie Hebdo""? And did you get that message that Madjid seems to have gotten from this cover? SARA KHAN, DIRECTOR OF BRITISH NGO, INSPIRE: No, I don't actually. I didn't find the image to be provocative or there was an attempt by ""Charlie Hebdo"" to be provocative, either. And I think we have to be very careful because when we say Muslims are offended, we're talking about 1.6 billion Muslims across the globe. They're going to hold very diverse views. And you will have views like Madjid, who will argue that it is offensive. But you'll have other views, who will (INAUDIBLE) Muslims will say it isn't. For myself personally, when I saw the image -- there were three messages I felt ""Charlie Hebdo"" were conveying. The first was that we're expressing solidarity with our murdered colleagues. The second actually was that they were trying to express a respectful representation of the Prophet, not in a physical sense, but respectful to his teachings. Many Muslims will tell you that the Prophet was a man who was regularly denigrated, mocked, humiliated, abused during his lifetime. And he responded with mercy, with compassion and, above all, forgiveness. So the ""all is forgiven"" struck on the top of the images is, for me, very powerful. And I think the third message of the cartoon showed that it's in defiance of the terrorists. It's saying that rather than denigrating ordinary Muslims across the world, we're actually undermining the message of the terrorists by saying it is you who insult the message and the teachings of the Prophets themselves. AMANPOUR: Let us get to the heart of the matter of the depiction. Yes, there have been much more offensive, vulgar depictions. But in terms of an edict against depicting the Prophet, it does not say that in the Quran. Where does this all come from?",0.7135867164292786,2015-01-14

So in his weekly radio address today, President Bush stressed what the bailout plan will actually do for Main Street. VOICE OF PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The legislation Congress passed provides the necessary tools to address the underlying problem in our financial system. The root of this problem is that as assets that banks hold have lost value. Their ability to provide credit has been restricted, making it more difficult for businesses and consumers to obtain affordable loans. Without decisive action, this credit crunch threatens to harm our entire economy. WHITFIELD: All right. Well, our CNN team will be following every step of the Wall Street rescue. Gerri Willis, by the way, and Catherine Callaway are both standing by right now with different perspectives on things. Gerri is there in New York, and break it down for us what we can expect from this. And Catherine Callaway is in Georgia, just about 20 minutes outside of Atlanta talking to people about their thoughts. So Gerri, let me begin with you and when does the money start flowing from this bill, or now law? GERRI WILLIS, CNN PERSONAL FINANCE EDITOR: Well, exactly. I know a lot of people out there they hear that $700 billion number, it actually starts at a much lower number. $250 billion of your tax money will start going to banks to buy this toxic debt that's clogging their balance sheets. This will hopefully, if everything works the way the Treasury Secretary believes, will allow credit to free up for other things, like loans to consumers, loans to businesses. You know, the entire credit system is essentially been shut down. Banks wouldn't even lend to banks. So it's hoped that this action, this move will actual free up credit, free up money, and that will help make the system healthier. Fred. WHITFIELD: Gerri, it's been so confusing for the average citizen, and that's why we're trying to take the pulse in Norcross, Georgia and that's where our Catherine Callaway is. Folks have a lot of questions, still, don't they, Catherine? CATHERINE CALLAWAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they really do. And Fred, it's not just is it going to work, but how is it going to work? A lot of people still don't understand a lot of the ideas in this proposal, and this plan that's been approved.

This one picture showing a tiny boy covered in dirt and blood briefly captured our attention. But for the most part the horror captured in these sometimes graphic pictures of children caught in war is ignored and quickly forgotten. Parents tell heroine stories, one Aleppo father writes in a letter to CNN.com. ""My daughter who is five-years old was born in this war and does not know anything about normal life. She is used to seeing the streets in ruins, full of debris, houses without walls or ceilings, and trees broken or burned. She has never once asked to go to a park or a playground or the theater because all of that ended in Aleppo before she was born."" CNN political and analyst and Washington Post analyst columnist Josh Rogin joins me now. So, Josh, you know, there have been moments throughout this war dragging into almost half a decade now where a pick will pop up, it will capture our attention for a bit. There was that boy who drowned, you remember the refugee who washed up on a beach in Greece. And now you have this little boy here. Why doesn't that effect last? JOSH ROGIN, WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST: Well, Jim, I think two things are going on here. One is that Syria has become such a chaotic, dangerous, and crazy place that it becomes a very hard story for the international media to cover. Many journalists take huge risks and sometimes even give their lives to cover this story. But there is just not enough coverage to keep this in the minds of the viewers. The other thing is that people becomes desensitized to images like this. Over the five years of the war people have just come to expect that Syria and the spillover of the Syrian conflict will produce horrors like this. But we should never become desensitized. We should always remember that this story is only one of thousands that is going on every single day. SCIUTTO: Well, here's the thing. We are in the states. We are in the midst of a presidential election. I can't tell you the last time the word Syria came up in anyone's speech. ROGIN: That's right. SCIUTTO: On either side.

As one of his player walks bench, you can see him say hit me, then spills his drink on the court. Guess what? The game is stopped to clean up the mess giving the Nets time to draw up one last time.

Chuck, you know, I get the sense -- I was listening to the late General Schwarzkopf there, the man shaping the battlefield. He`s basically saying, If this government gets shut down and we`re not paying our bills, it is a decision by the Republican-led House of Representatives. He wants the story played that well -- played that way. Will the press or can it objectively say that if the government shuts down, it`s the Republicans, simply their doing? CHUCK TODD, NBC WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT/POLITICAL DIR.: Well, when it comes to the debt ceiling... (CROSSTALK) TODD: ... if we default -- don`t forget, there`s two -- there`s two separate questions here, right? One -- and there`s two separate ideas of - - is there something to negotiate. One is debt ceiling, and what the president was saying -- there`s no discussion on that. On the government shutdown, there seemed to be a different tone from the president. I`ll get to that in a minute. But on debt ceiling, you`re absolutely right. When you take that sentence, what he was trying to say, because he`s not talking about having plan B`s in his back pocket, things like minting coins, 14th Amendment, which Senate Democrats are begging him to do. He`s saying, No, if we default -- he wants to make it clear then Republicans will have decided not to send out Social Security checks, not to pay our military, not to do these things. So you`re right, he`s hoping that the political blame -- now, the irony here, Chris, is senior Republican leaders, they agree with the president on that. They know that that`s a politically bad place for them to be. The question is, it`s going to shift to the government funding and shutdown going forward. And there, talking to aides, they get -- that`s -- that`s up for negotiation. But they want it separated from debt ceiling, Chris. MATTHEWS: OK, let`s talk about this debt ceiling thing, Howard.

This was all be authorized and was properly regulated and there was a safety jet captain with us as well. And it was apparently the same co-pilot and we believe maybe the same captain that was on board the aircraft. These are the pictures of landing of the aircraft, after we were flying down from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur, and it's one of those very strange incidents. JOHNS: This flight occurred just about a third into the way of a six- hour flight. Technically, what's happening at that point, and what might cause a problem? I've heard this might have been considered the safest part of the flight? QUEST: There's no question. This plane was -- the phrase is in the cruise. It was flying at about 36,000 feet according to the various logs. It will have been maybe drifting up slowly, as it was burning off fuel. But this was -- the plane would have been on autopilot. Both pilots would have been doing regular check calls, on-route checks to the various air traffic controls. In this case, we believe it was already under the control of Ho Chi Minh. You know, this is one area of flight where you don't expect that to happen. It's not takeoff. It's not landing. The plane was proceeding in an orderly direction.

WALLACE: Asked by a radio interviewer Wednesday if he were finding it difficult to get traction on issues like health care when the country's attention is on Iraq, Kerry said not at all. And aides say that message might not get national press, but makes it into the headlines locally. For instance, on the front page of Wednesday's Orlando Sentinel, Kerry brings health message to town. But there is one pocketbook issue that could come back to haunt the presumptive Democratic nominee. Kerry, who has made jobs lost under President Bush a campaign issue, missed Tuesday's vote in the Senate on a measure extending unemployment benefits. It failed to pass by just one vote. Asked about his absence, Kerry accused Republicans of playing politics with the bill. KERRY: So it's not really a one-vote margin. It's a multiple- vote margin, because they don't want it to happen. And it was very clear that even if it passed the Senate, they're not going to pass it in the House.

There is no way to really be able to trace all of these people when you take into account that more than 8,000 people per day are actually contracting the virus and then you have to try to call them and then try to figure out all of the different people who they've come in contact with and warn them about it. So, this is turning into an extremely difficult situation here. All this to be said that we're now hearing from the Public Health Director here in Los Angeles that there could actually be another absolute shutdown here, not just of businesses, not just a few businesses, but a complete shutdown just like we had to deal with at the very beginning of this -- Anderson. GUPTA: You know, Sara, if anybody knows anything about California, what they hear is that Governor Newsom did act pretty quickly in mid- March shutting down the state. And, in fact, mayors in some of the major cities were starting to shut down even before the state did. So the narrative was that California seemed to be doing everything right. So what happened here? What do you think caused this surge? SIDNER: So we've talked to health experts and they have basically said, look, if you look back to Memorial Day, people apparently just went hog wild, not wearing the masks. They must have gotten together with one another, not self-distancing because what they saw in the couple two to three weeks after Memorial Day is this major surge. What did that make them do? They said, okay, on July 4th, we are going to have to close down some of the beaches in the highly infected areas, but in other areas like San Diego County, they saw people flocking to the beaches and not doing the social distancing. So they really think this is an issue of people just having fatigue and deciding that you know what, we're fine. We also know there are some statistics behind that here in Los Angeles County that people between the ages of 18 and 40 years old are responsible for about 50 percent or more of the new positive coronavirus cases. So it tells you that younger people are getting this more often and they link that likely to gatherings and not taking all the precautions that they've been asked to take. There is certainly fatigue here, but there are a lot of people that are so incredibly frustrated and afraid for the economy and for",0.2607528230865746,2020-07-16

So it doesn`t appear to be getting worse in that way. The World Health Organization recently said global cases are on a plateau and there are some areas, including several U.S. states where the number of cases is holding steady or decreasing. But while some college campuses have said COVID-19 hasn`t been a major problem, that cases have been relatively low. Others have cancelled events like spring break to try to keep students from traveling, catching COVID and returning to campus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is where students here at the University of Wisconsin-Madison get taken when they test positive for COVID-19, to isolation housing. Nobody goes in. Nobody comes out. It`s all part of the university`s effort to try and get a handle on the outbreak here on campus where it took just five days to go from the first day of classes to students restricted to essential activities only. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Since move in started at Wisconsin in late August, more than 2,000 students have tested positive for COVID-19. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They sent me an email. Pack your bags and get out of there as soon as possible. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Freshman Keir Metter (ph) is one of them. Why do you think it`s so difficult to contain COVID-19 outbreaks on college campuses? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can say like don`t do this and don`t do that but it`s very difficult to enforce all of that. (Inaudible) probably why they can`t send everyone home. That`s why, because we`re just going to spread it all across the country if we do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Metter (ph) says he`s had mild to no symptoms so far and he`s been isolation housing for days as he waits out his two-week period. In total, more than 350 students are in isolation at the university with another 100-plus quarantining. The rest of the undergraduate campus has been restricted to essential activities only. A move students say they only learned about last minute. Rushing to grocery stores as cases continue to climb. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You`re sitting in the elevator with people that might have it. Of course, you have your mask on and you`re like, well that does something but not 100 percent of, you know, everything. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Across his dorm and another, roughly 20 percent of the students have been infected according to the school. Residents in those dorms have been told they can leave the building for 30 minutes, three times a day to secure meals and get a breath of fresh air. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We`re almost certainly going to see significant case numbers continue over this coming week. By identifying people who test positive and moving them into isolation.

The Humane Society says it shows workers at this Chino, California, meat packing plant abusing what are called downer cows, cattle no longer able to stand. Cows not supposed to be slaughtered for their meat. MICHAEL MARKARIAN, HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE U.S.: The slaughter plant workers would kick them, jab them in the eye, ram them with the blades of a forklift and do anything they could to try to get these poor creatures to stand up so they could put them into the kill box. ECHAVEZ: The Agriculture Department says the cattle were being processed for human consumption, a huge concern for USDA food safety inspectors. Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing is putting 143 millions pounds in raw and frozen beef. The company supplied beef to some fast food chains and the Federal School Lunch Program in some states. The secretary of agriculture issued a statement saying, ""I am dismayed at the inhumane handling of cattle that has resulted in the violation of food safety regulations at Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company. This action is necessary because the plant procedures violated USDA regulations."" MARKARIAN: Because these downer cattle are more likely to carry mad cow disease, salmonella, E.

Now comes more proof of that from a private research group called the National Security Archive which obtained its material under the Freedom of Information Act. In 2002 U.S. officials thought that four years after Saddam Hussein was gone, the situation in Iraq would be quite different than it is today. They expected, among other things, a representative Iraqi government to be in place. The Iraqi army to be working to keep things calm. And as few as 5,000 U.S. troops remaining in-country. A pretty far cry from President Bush sending an additional 21,500 troops to join the 132,000 U.S> troops already in Iraq. The executive director of the National Security Archive calls the assumptions in these reports, quote, ""delusions,"" unquote.

Also, big bucks and big perks, Rudy Giuliani's gig as a high-paid speaker is now under the microscope because he's a White House hopeful. Stay with us. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.

Joining us now, the assistant secretary of state, Chris Hill, the chief American negotiator. He's just back from those talks. Mr. Secretary, thanks very much for coming in. CHRISTOPHER HILL, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE: Sure. BLITZER: It didn't take very long for the former United States ambassador to the United Nations to say this is a really bad deal for the United States. Listen to what John Bolton told us here in THE SITUATION ROOM. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS: It sends exactly the wrong signal to would-be proliferators around the world. If you hold out long enough and wear down the State Department negotiators, eventually you get rewarded, in this case with massive shipments of heavy fuel oil for doing only partially what needs to be done to complete the dismantling of their nuclear program. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: Mr. Secretary, do you want to respond to the former ambassador? HILL: Well, look, he's a private citizen. He's certainly entitled to his views.

The reality is, as David suggests, we haven`t restored Glass/Steagall, so that firm line is not there.

WHITFIELD: All right, coming up next, a security breach at the president's favorite getaway. Why Secretary of State Mike Pompeo now says a recent guest at Mar-a-Lago could be a Chinese spy. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WHITFIELD: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is now suggesting a security breach at Mar-a-Lago could be linked to Chinese espionage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: But I think this tells the American people the threat that China poses. The efforts that they're making here inside the United States not only against government officials but more broadly. (END VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: The FBI launched an investigation into possible espionage after a woman was arrested on the Mar-a-Lago property last week. She was allegedly found with Chinese passports, four cell phones, and a flash drive containing malicious software -- malware. Pompeo's comments are a stark contrast to President Trump who dismissed concerns about the breach calling it a fluke situation. Let's bring in former Secret Service agent under President Obama, Jonathan Wackrow. So, Jonathan, you know, how does something like this happen? JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LEGAL ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, listen, I think it was important to let everybody know is what did not happen. The president was never in any physical danger because of this incident. There is no, you know, breach, security breach of physical security measures. What did happen is that the Secret Service protocols worked. Their security plan worked and that a potential threat was actually thwarted as, you know, planned under the security protocols. WHITFIELD: OK. However, the U.S. Secret Service does say that the club management actually determines who has access to Mar-a-Lago. And is that the way it should be when you have a president even though he has a separate, you know, residence wouldn't Secret Service still be in charge of security even at the president's secret -- you know, private residence I should say? WACKROW: Well, they are in charge of security. But it's important to note that, you know, Mar-a-Lago's often referred to as the winter White House. It's not the White House, it's not a government, you know, facility. It's a private commercial, you know, a location that the president, you know, goes to temporarily. The security structure that set up at Mar-a-Lago is the exact same as any other temporary facility that the president goes to. So take today for instance that the president is traveling to Las Vegas, the security structure that is set up for that event mirrors that methodology that is at Mar-a-Lago.

WILLIAMS: I'm respectfully declining. TUCHMAN: Don Williams is also the pastor at the church on the Hephzibah House grounds. A former church-goer gave CNN a CD sold by the church in which Williams is apparently preaching his views about who is to blame when a male whistles at a female. WILLIAMS: If you girls are walking down the sidewalk and some fellows drive by and they whistle, you better stop and think about that. What drew that whistle? Was it the way I was walking or maybe the way I was dressed or whatever? Did I do something to defraud those men? TUCHMAN: Hephzibah's web site features pictures of girls who have attended and claims there are no spankings or any out of the ordinary punishments. This facility has been around for about four decades. It seems to be a thriving enterprise. As you can see the people in charge don't particularly want to answer my questions. We're not alone. They don't really answer government either. In Indiana group homes operated by churches and religious ministries are exempt from licensure. So nobody in the government even knows what's going on behind the closed doors. The women say their parents also had no idea what was going on there.

TUCHMAN: The Indiana governor's office says there's nothing it can do. The attorney general's office says it doesn't have jurisdiction and the same thing with the Indiana Department of Education.

We talked to a dozen women who say they were victimized at Hephzibah House, and they said they could never make any private phone calls or send uncensored letters while on the inside.

First, I want to go back to your thoughts on Meghan Markle because in 2003, you were her professor at Northwestern University for a class on contemporary African-American theater. What are your memories of her during that time? HARVEY YOUNG, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I taught Meghan back in 2003. She was a student in my very small eight-person seminar. We sat in a circle and we talk about contemporary black theater. I just remember Meghan being a person who would walk in full of life. She was a senior who was clearly sort of juggling lots of exciting things, sorority life. She was double majoring in theater, also international relations. And, you know, we had great deep conversations and I came to sort of respect her insight, her intelligence, her presence. LU STOUT: Meghan Markle, she is a biracial actress. She discussed greater issues about, you know, race and identity with you, and how? YOUNG: Yea, absolutely. So, the class itself was about experiences -- a race with -- as reflected within theaters. So every week across 10 weeks reread (ph), play after play, article after article, talking about race in United States. And those conversations both of (ph) one another. And as extension of those conversations, what we did was we -- we talk about our own personal experiences. So both within class and outside of class in office hours, Meghan will talk about what it meant to be biracial, what it meant to be a person who could -- on the one hand now to get certain rooms, have access to plenty different spaces and communities. But at the same time to often be misread, to have some part of herself be critiqued and subject to the aired biases and prejudices of others. I remember talking with her and realizing the toll (ph) that I was taking. LU STOUT: She discussed issues like race and identity with you. What about politics and activism? You know, we know that she is also an activist. Did that side of her come through inside or outside the classroom during her days at Northwestern? YOUNG: Yeah, absolutely. Meghan was a double major.

He was found not guilty in the shooting death of Chris Johnson. So, Mr. O'Mara, I can't say Mark because both of might answer. Mr. O'Mara, do you feel there was enough evidence in this case to prove stand-your-ground? Do you think the jury came to the right verdict? O'MARA: Well, you know, we have to defer to the jury's verdict when they have the chance to look at the case and applied the law. Certainly, when you look at that videotape, you wonder whether or not Edmonson had an opportunity to do something else besides shoot and nit even talked about some modifications to what we call stand-your-ground in a way to try and make that your decision of last resort, not first resort. So, it seems like the jury listened to the statute that was in place and came to the right verdict. We have to trust them. Bud I always thought that stand-your-ground can be polished a little bit. LEMON: OK. That's interesting that you say that because when I talk to the prosecutors and even the defense attorneys there, they're saying hey, listen. No law is perfect and there is no chance that any of this legislation that is happening around the country to try to overturn stand your ground is going to be affected and it is going to happen. But you think, and it is interesting, because you defended right, George Zimmerman, you think that stand your ground, not that you used it in that case, but stand your ground can be tweaked and I guess more importantly, do you think that it's discriminatory against people of color? O'MARA: To the first question, I think it can be tweaked in this way. Unfortunately because of the George Zimmerman case, 100 million people have now heard about stand your ground. And I think they have gotten the misimpression or misinterpretation of it. I believe that it should be modified to say though you can stand your ground, if you can move away, if you can retreat without increasing the danger to yourself or to others, then you should try and take that opportunity. Again, it's a very thin slice. But I think if we at least say that is a change in the law, then people will realize you still can protect yourself in a danger situation that you should try and remove yourself if you can without increase danger to yourself. LEMON: OK. Mr. Nejame, the shooter here, Mr. Edmonson, had martial arts training according to the court's documents and to the attorneys there.

Critics of President Donald Trump were targeted with pipe bombs. VANIER: And a man with a history of racist rants is charged with killing two African-Americans at a Kentucky grocery store. CNN's Boris Sanchez reports that Mr. Trump responded with familiar anti-media and anti-gun control themes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Trump was asked multiple times last week about potentially toning down his rhetoric in light of two domestic terror incidents but the President on multiple occasions denied that his rhetoric had anything to do with those cases. He was asked specifically whether he might tone things down last week and he joked that he might tone them up. In fact before a rally in front of his supporters in southern Illinois, the President told reporters that he would consider toning down his rhetoric if only he didn't have to combat what he called a dishonest media. At that rally in southern Illinois, the President called on his supporters and all Americans to unite in the face of anti-Semitism. And he condemned the Pittsburgh shooter. I should note that when The President was specifically asked if he would consider gun control legislation as a way to prevent these sort of incidents from happening in the future, he dismissed that idea and he had other thoughts. Listen to this. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better. This is a dispute that will always exist, I suspect. But if they had some kind of a protection inside the temple maybe it could have been a very much different situation. SANCHEZ: There you heard President Trump reiterate an idea that we've heard before, previously after that school shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The idea that armed guards at schools or places of worship could potentially deter a shooter from entering the premises.

That is one of the things we're learning tonight from law enforcement officials, who tell us the suspect is talking with them. He's talking with police, with the FBI. And he's providing some information. And part of what they've learned is that he did try to escape, try to blend in with the crowd. They've also learned that he pulled the fire alarm to draw people out of the school when he got outside, and he wanted to get a higher death toll. In doing so, he pushed the alarm, he sets off the fire alarm, and therefore, when people ran out, we believe there may have been some gunshots exchanged. This all indicates to investigators from the folks that we've been talking to that there was some level of planning in this. And as you said, he escaped from the school. This also seemed to have been part of the plan. And what we're also learning is that he left his weapon behind, this AR-15 style rifle. They have been able to process it. It's with police. It's with the FBI and the ATF and they're now going to trace it. They want to learn about where this weapon came from. And police really have learned a lot about this suspect from his social media. You know, we've heard the Sheriff time and time today, again and again tell us, if you see something, say something, and he's really referring to those social media posts. He called them disturbing, and police are working through those social media postings, and really the question that most law enforcement now has is why didn't anyone alert this guy to police to say, hey, look at what he's posting. The Sheriff brought that up tonight, and this continues to be a focus of the investigation. COOPER: Right. I mean, some of the social media posts, which I think we put earlier on the screen or in a piece were very direct about the weapon he had, what his intentions for it. PROKUPECZ: That's exactly right.

Meanwhile, Myanmar's -- VAUSE: -- government has denied the U.N.'s charges of ethnic cleansing in Rakhine State saying that the military took full measures to avoid collateral damage and the harming of innocent civilians. But the U.N. describes widespread and systematic persecution killings and rapes that it says very likely amount to crimes against humanity. And tune in tomorrow for part two of Clarissa Ward's exclusive report. She's show us the dangerous river crossing, thousands of Rohingya refugees are taking to try and escape the violence. After the break, we'll have more on the crisis facing the Rohingya, including the global pressure on Myanmar to do something about this humanitarian crisis as its military denies the atrocities against the Rohingya people. That's still to come. (MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING) VAUSE: Welcome back, everybody. U.S. secretary of state Rex Tillerson will be in Myanmar on Wednesday. He's expected to push for an end to the violence against the Rohingya. He met with Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi Tuesday on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit when a reporter asked Suu Kyi if she believes the Rohingya were Myanmar citizens. The question ignored and reporters were ushered out of the room. Louise Auban (ph) is a senior emergency coordinator with the U.N. Refugee Agency. She joins us now from Cox Bazaar in Bangladesh. Louise, thank you for being with us. You know, despite all of the evidence of this ongoing persecution of the Rohingya, it barely rated a mention at the meeting of Southeast Asian leaders. According to Reuters, the final communique form the ASEAN summit, just one paragraph mentions the importance of humanitarian relief provided for victims of natural disasters in Vietnam and a recent urban battle with Islamist militants in the Philippines. And here is comes, as well as affected communities in northern Rakhine State. Why are so many leaders so reluctant to try and intervene here and do something? LOUISE AUBAN (PH), UNRA: Well, it's difficult to understand because here we're dealing with probably one of the fastest growing refugee crises we've witnessed in decades. Rohingya refugees have been streaming across the border and they still do in search of security and life-saving assistance. It is hard to ignore and certainly the government of Bangladesh and the people of Bangladesh have not been ignoring the plight of refugees. I think they're showing the world the best demonstration of compassion we've seen in a very long time. VAUSE: One of the poorest countries",0.0388245281134525,2017-11-14

TED DEUTSCHE (D-FL): Madam Speaker, I yield five minutes to Representative Ocasio-Cortez. SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: The gentlelady from New York is recognized for five minutes. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Thank you, Chairman. And thank you, Madam Speaker. I have been serving in this body just under three years. In that three years, an enormous amount has happened. But in response to the Republican leader's remarks, when he says that this action is unprecedented. What I believe is unprecedented is for a member of House leadership of either party to be unable to condemn incitement of violence against a member of this body. It is sad. It is a sad day in which a member who leads a political party in the United States of America cannot bring themselves to say that issuing a depiction of murdering a member of Congress is wrong. And instead, decides to venture off into a tangent about gas prices and inflation. What is so hard? What is so hard about saying that this is wrong. This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept. Not just the Republican leader, but I have seen other members of this party advance the argument, including Representative Gosar himself, the illusion that this was just a joke. That what we say and what we do does not matter so long as we claim a lack of meaning. Now this denialism runs deep and it conveys and betrays, a certain contempt for the meaning and importance of our work here. That what we do, so long as we claim is a joke, doesn't matter. That what we say here doesn't matter. That our actions every day as elected leaders in the United States of America, doesn't matter. That this chamber and what happens in it doesn't matter. And I am here to rise to say that it does. Our work here matters. Our example matters. There's meaning in our service. And as leaders in this country, when we incite violence with depictions against our colleagues, that trickles down into violence of this country. And that's when they must draw the line of independence of party or belief. It is about a core recognition of human dignity and value and worth. So when we talk about, as mentioned in the resolution, that these depictions are part of a larger trend of misogyny and racist misogyny. This has results in dampening the participation. So this vote is not as complex as perhaps the Republican leader would like to make folks believe. It's pretty cut and dried. Do you find -- does anyone in this chamber find this behavior acceptable? Would you allow depictions of violence, against women, against colleagues? Would you allow this in your home? Do you think this should happen on a school board, in",0.2625462294973216,2021-11-17

All of this ahead on LEGAL VIEW. Hello, everyone, and welcome. It's May 23rd. I'm Ashleigh Banfield. We want to begin today with a critical new development in a story that we've been following here at CNN, and it is in the Donald Sterling saga. CNN has just learned that the embattled owner of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers has given his wife and Clippers co-owner, Shelly, the authority to negotiate that team's involuntary sale. CNN's Stephanie Elam has the details. She's live with us in Los Angeles. So, first of all, Stephanie, clear this up. She has always said she was a co-owner. She has always said she has a stake in this. Is this what this has come to now, he's just agreeing to this and he's making the problem go away for the NBA or is there more to it? STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I don't think it makes it go away, but the idea here being that they own this through the Sterling family trust and that he owns 50 percent, she owns 50 percent. If this is the case, he's giving her this 50 percent. So she's saying, look, I didn't say anything crazy. I didn't say anything racist. I didn't do any of that. And so that means then you're going to have to work with me, NBA, and negotiate the sale on my terms. So still putting out there that this would be something she'd be willing to do, but also to make sure that she gets the full value of the team. Now, what we do know is that in the past, Shelly Sterling has shown that she's very capable and very willing to go after something that she believes is hers. Think about it.

And the likelihood is that there will be other attacks.\n \n\n The success of this attack was pretty incredible. Nine suicide bombers, four different simultaneous occasions, five\ndifferent cars packed with explosives. Even after the raid last week. It shows that al Qaeda is very much alive in Saudi Arabia.\n \n\n MATTHEWS: What does it tell you about the relationship between al Qaeda and the Saudi government? That they would bomb\nin the country and kill a lot of Saudis, apparently?\n \n\n EMERSON: Well, you know, it`s still a schizophrenic relationship because last week, as Pete Williams noted in his report\njust now, the fact that 19 conspirators or alleged suspects could get away that easily meant there really is some sympathy\nwithin the government. There is still funding.\n \n\n On the other hand, they definitely want to crack down. There are some elements. So it`s sort of two steps forward, one\nstep back. Sometimes two steps backwards.\n \n\n The Saudi government is not consistent in term of its application of a counter-terrorist doctrine. The fact is, however,\nthis now, this awakening of the Saudi regime may force them to say, all right, we`re going to finally crack down, convincingly\nand systematically. It remains to be seen now what they`re going to do.\n \n\n MATTHEWS: Let`s take a look at this. Yesterday`s bombings came a week after a new al Qaeda spokesman warned a London-based\nArabic language magazine of future plots, quote, catch this, the size of the September 11 attacks. He said, quote, ""A strike\nagainst America is definitely coming.""\n \n\n Do you see that in any of the chatter, Steve? Steve Emerson.\n \n\n EMERSON: In the last two months, I know, according to intelligence and law enforcement sources who monitor Internet\nas well as electronic overhears or satellite communications, that they definitely have picked up coded references to the movement\nof people and to the fact that U.S. targets were being cased and surveillance against them.\n \n\n The only question was, where was it being done and who was going to be the target? They didn`t have the answer.\n \n\n The extraordinary accuracy of U.S. warnings in the last seven weeks in Saudi Arabia, that an attack was imminent, was\nright on the money. The problem was they just didn`t know where it was going to occur. In that case, that`s why the U.S. was\npulling out people out of Saudi Arabia. And I suspect Qatar and UAE and Kuwait will not be, will shortly follow through in\nterm of their being, having vulnerable American and western compounds.\n \n\n Because if Saudi Arabia can`t his Americans -- if al Qaeda can`t hit Americans in Saudi Arabia, they`ll hit them closer\nto home in Yemen or in the other Persian Gulf regimes.\n \n\n MATTHEWS: Steven Schwartz, tell me about Mr. al-Juhani, who was mentioned as the top al",0.2143037230019329,2003-05-13

But what I can say regarding us is that most of the passengers really and definitely realized what was going on between New York and Miami, because we definitely realized what was happening and what happened during New York and Miami, and... VERJEE: And Elizabeth, did the pilot come on at any point and explain the situation or what was going to happen, or the fact that you would be escorted by F-15s to Boston? How did that happen? HAYNES: They let us know. They warned us that in the very beginning, the first hour right after it happened. We didn't -- nobody told us anything; then, about an hour later, the pilot didn't come over the loudspeaker to say anything until quite a bit later. But a man, one of the flight attendants, came and said we all should be prepared that a SWAT team was going to come on board to take the man away and that we would have to deboard the plane, not take any of our items, our personal items with us, and we had to follow everything that they said to the letter. And in fact, that's not what happened. I mean, the SWAT team came and took the man off board, but we ended up deplaning with our goods. But then, finally, at the end, a lot closer to Boston, the pilot came on and said, you know, that the SWAT team would come on, and that we should listen to what the flight attendants were saying and follow the instructions.

But did today's hearing really clear anything up? ANDERSON: Anderson, short answer to that, no. The motion filed by Debra Opri, attorney for Larry Birkhead, of course was denied by the judge today. A full hearing was scheduled for February 20. And what that means, in part, is that a burial or cremation of Anna Nicole's body will be delayed, because the judge ordered that her body remain in Florida and be preserved there until at least February 20. Now I know we have been talking about this third man, Prince Frederick von Anhalt, tossing his hat into the ring as a potential father.

They\'re going to get there. Romney might have more, but the Obama campaign will have a lot. And so, you do hit a\nsaturation point. You do have a point where every voter in every swing state is seeing these ads 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 times\na week, and not of real sort of incremental value becomes less so. So, the other point we should make is that Obama has\nnow come out to potentially a constitutional amendment to get money out of politics that would limit campaign donations. I\ndon\'t see a very chance of that happening, but it does represent if not a reversal, a new sort of -- a new way of him trying\nto square this circle, where he says, look, on the one hand, I have to recognize the system post-Citizens United is what it\nis and I have to participate in it.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EILEEN O'CONNOR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): ""An historic opportunity,"" that's how Oracle is billing the speech by the former president to its annual Expo this year in New Orleans. Some attending agree, it's a draw. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The man spent eight years in the White House, and (inaudible) there's still a lot of controversy around him. And, you know, boy, I can't wait to hear what he has to say. O'CONNOR: But speeches aren't making the controversy over fugitive financier Marc Rich go away. Mr. Clinton explained in an op- ed piece in ""The New York Times"" his legal reasoning for the Rich pardon, that the indictment was flawed, that even some Republican lawyers had represented Rich and argued against the legal merits of the indictment, that Rich had the backing of prominent Israelis for his charitable deeds. This defense, some Democrats and Republicans say, wasn't enough. SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: There is no excuse for pardoning a fugitive from justice. You can't let somebody opt out of the system by running away and then opt into the system by being pardoned. REP. DAN BURTON (R), GOVERNMENT REFORM CHAIRMAN: We want to find out is why he did it, he -- this editorial does not explain it. And we want to find out if there was a quid pro quo. If there was a quid pro quo, that's a felony. O'CONNOR: Mr. Clinton denied donations of any kind influenced his decision. Some Democrats are calling this whole thing a vendetta. JOE LOCKHART, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: What we know now is that the president decided this based on the legal merits and that any suggestion that fund raising or anything improper is absolutely false. O'CONNOR: Mr. Clinton was hoping that by taking the case to the people, he could get on with his post-presidential life as a lecturer and author. But some analysts say this might not be so easy.

Most of the Democrats\nin the Senate think Baucus is nuts to be trying to do a deal with the Republicans. I`m certain most of the Republicans think\nGrassley is kind of kooky to be still trying to cut a deal with the Democrats.

196482,344233,CNN,American Morning,"BILL HEMMER, CNN ANCHOR: I want to get back to Iraq right now. That's where we begin now, that changing approach to U.S. policy in that country. The Pentagon has started a get-tough military operation called Iron Hammer taking place in central Baghdad yesterday. It's one reaction to the increasing size and the frequency of attacks against coalition forces, such as the bombing of Italian police headquarters yesterday. All that sending a chill through third-party countries like Japan, today announcing a change of heart, it's decided not to send its troops to Iraq. A second reaction comes from the White House, which dispatched civilian administrator, Paul Bremer, back to Iraq with the mission of moving up the timetable for Iraqi self-government. With all of that as a backdrop now, Dana Bash picks up the story from there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANA BASH, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After two days of White House talks, President Bush is sending his Iraq administrator back to Baghdad with a proposed shift in U.S. strategy -- to turn governing power over to Iraqis more quickly. PAUL BREMER, IRAQ CIVIL ADMINISTRATOR: The stakes are very high for moving towards a sovereign Iraqi government. BASH: According to senior U.S. official, the president authorized a few major options for the U. S.-picked Iraqi Governing Council to consider, including an interim Iraqi constitution and interim Iraqi leadership. Another possibility: a provisional leader, like Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai. But U.S. officials caution Iraqis may not accept that model as legitimate, because of the country's diverse ethnic and religious makeup, and also say there is no specific timetable for the plan. During the fall U.N. debate, the White House strongly opposed any return of control to Iraqis without free elections. GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The constitution must be written, and there will be free elections. And then sovereignty will occur. BASH: Now a White House concession. SCOTT MCCLELLAN, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: You need to be willing to adjust and adapt to circumstances on the ground in terms of reconstruction and in terms of the political front. BASH: This adjustment is fueled by increasing attacks against coalition targets and a new grim CIA assessment more Iraqis, disillusioned with the U. S.-led occupation, are joining the insurgency. BREMER: The terrorists are trying to encourage the Iraqi people to believe that the United States is not going to stay the course. BASH: Officials admit the urgent White House push is also aimed at the slow-moving Iraqi Governing Council to meet a December 15 deadline for a permanent transition plan. (END VIDEOTAPE) Bush officials say they were intentionally vague about the details of the plan until the Governing Council is briefed, hoping Iraqis see their own leaders deciding the future of their government and not the White House -- Bill. HEMMER: Dana, you used the word ""vague"" there, but is there a target date, other than that mid-December date we've talked about for months?

CUOMO: He said he put out the proof of that as well. KING: But the government -- CABRERA: That was a complicated issue, while taking on ISIS or going at Iran or negotiations with Russia would be simple. KING: But a conservative candidate that would give Planned Parenthood some money and will look at a federal role in equal pay is going to raise eyebrows you would think among the conservative base and the conservative organization to say those are marketplaces, or they're economic issue, those are market positions. But Mr. Trump has on a number of occasions back when he was thinking about running for the Reform Party nomination 15 years ago he spoke favorably about single payer health insurance. So he has taken a number of positions that would think would be anathema to the conservative base, but because of the power of personality and his position saying we need leaders, and look at the buttons he touched in that interview. There's no respect for our president. That plays well with the conservative base. We can't play the world's policemen, yet he would go after ISIS. You need the Europeans to step up, others to step up. He is a very smart person. He's running a very unorthodox campaign, but he knows how to speak to the people who are with him so far. And so far he's not losing them. CUOMO: And he definitely said something very significant about Jeb. He wants this is thing that Jeb said about women's health to be a real death blow for him. He was spinning that effectively as well. And there's no question that politics is part deflection, and this man, Mr. Trump, is very good at it. It's gotten him to where he is right now.

The audience, however, does better with an effect it can see. And when the picture makes a subject invisible or brings it back a layer of tissue at a time, the audience gets a disturbing and startling show. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, ""HOLLOW MAN"") SHUE: It's working. It's actually working! BACON: Of course it is. (END VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL: For the disappearing and almost-reappearing Kevin Bacon, the actor was painstakingly scanned and his measurements used to create digital animation based on Bacon's own movements, techniques that are only now becoming available to filmmakers. PAUL VERHOEVEN, DIRECTOR: If it would not amaze people, then they would say, ""Oh, that's the same we have seen before."" It had to be something that is different. And I think that could only be done in the last one and half, two years. MICHAEL: Kevin Bacon says there's something about an actor being invisible that goes against the grain. BACON: As an actor, there were some very important things that I was not able to use. One is my eyes, my face. It was often just a piece of body, you know, a gesture, an outline of the head. When I had the mask, the mask is fairly expressive, but it's missing the eyes. So, in a way, you're not really firing with all your guns, you know. You have to look at each scene and trust that the director is getting enough emotional content. MICHAEL: Director Paul Verhoeven says he got everything he needed from Kevin Bacon, including a startling degree of personal sacrifice for the movie. VERHOEVEN: Not only did you need somebody that could play charismatic and evil, you also needed somebody that was very down to earth, and was not afraid to go through suffering.

I think there's a concerted effort, financed by very well oiled machines, that are attempting to distract the American public from the essence of these plans. They're talking about things like this bogus-totally bogus issue like euthanasia and things like that. They don't want the American people to focus on the fact that their stability and their security is what we're primarily concerned about. The Republicans and many in the industry, the health care industry, know that the biggest political victory that any Democratic president or Congress can win is to reform health care successfully. They are dead set on denying us that opportunity. They've expressed that in documents. Jim Demint said this would be President Obama's Waterloo. We know what they are trying to do. We've got to remain focused on talking to the American people about how they will benefit from what we're trying to do. And once we tell that story-and I've had it happen dozens and dozens of times already. Once we explain that to them, they become very, very enthusiastic supporters of our reform measure. O'DONNELL: There are no professionals in Washington on this subject who are more expert about it than Janis Mays (ph) and the Ways and Means Committee staff that you work with every day. YARMUTH: Right. O'DONNELL: Does Chairman Rangel and Speaker Pelosi have them combing these bills right now, looking for possible radioactive items that should be pulled out, no matter what their value might be, because they can be exploited and misrepresented more easily than others? YARMUTH: Yes, we probably made a mistake in not doing that initially. I think you always-you always expect and you hope that you're going to have an honest debate on these issues, particularly one as important as health care. We should have anticipated that we would not get an honest debate. So we are looking through those provisions again. You never know. You never know the breadth of distortion that people are capable of. It's a little bit hard to do that. We are looking for other possibilities, because, again, this is much too important to play games with. Unfortunately, the people who want to kill this are playing games.

I am getting a lot of money and I don't want it to be wasted. (END VIDEO CLIP) MATTINGLY: And one of the critiques, if you will, and to be frank, we cover Congress. I've heard a lot of Democrats come out and raise concerns of any kind about Secretary Shanahan. That he doesn't have foreign policy experience, doesn't have diplomatic experience. But to your point, that he's been on the acquisition side, he's been on the budgeting side and that brings real cache into the department. KIRBY: Yes, that's not all bad. I mean, don't get me wrong, he still needs to get familiar with operations and sort of Secretary Mattis is much more familiar with that than he was the buying stuff. There is an argument that there is a steep learning curve for him, but I do believe that if he puts the effort into it and really studies it, gets out and about, talks to allies and partners, he can mound that challenge. MICHAEL SHEAR, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Can I say that I agree, but the one area that we haven't talked about and the thing that is probably the steepest is navigating this president, right? What all of the president's secretaries have come to find is that putting aside the expertise they need to run their particular agency, one of the biggest things they have to figure out how to do is to navigate the president's whims and Twitter attacks and the sense that whatever might be the sort of general direction of the department that they have to cater to the whims of this president. And I think especially in this kind of the defense, foreign policy word, that can get really tricky really fast. You know, does Shanahan do what the building wants in North Korea, or does he do what the president wants in North Korea. And those things have been in tension quite a bit for the last two years and I think it's going to increase. KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: But in a way, Shanahan has the advantage that the admiral is kind of referring to, right? Which is that he's got this sort of business acumen, or at least Trump sees him as having that sort of -- but he is not in a role where he is not running the treasury. He's not being put into Fed chair.

I know we had a chance to speak earlier today. As we have heard your story, just recount for everybody where you were in the theater as we`re getting a better idea of what happened early this morning. TANNER COON, WITNESS TO COLORADO SHOOTING (via telephone): I was the fourth row from the very back. I saw -- the first thing I saw was the canister thrown, with smoke trailing. I saw the first gunshot flash. And you know, up to that point, I thought there were kids throwing smoke bombs and lighting off a firecracker. Then I heard more gunshots and I realized they were gunshots, and that`s when I told my friends that we needed to get down on the floor. And so, that`s what we did, we got down behind the seats in front of us on the floor. And the guy shot off about 20 rounds, 20, 30 rounds, and just consistent shots, and then there was a pause. I looked up, saw him, a glimpse of his silhouette, and then he started shooting again. And so I took -- ducked my head again, and then once the shooting was stopped, people started running up the stairs toward the exit. And I was on the opposite side of the exit, so I got up, noticed a man on one of the side seats who was sitting there, still, while everyone else was running up, and he was kind of sitting there, kind of slouched over, so I assumed he must have been hurt or maybe he was dead. And then I noticed that everyone who ran up to the top of the auditorium was either in the first or the second row. So I decided to take the third row to the exit so that would be easiest for me, and basically right behind where I was sitting, I slipped and fell on some blood. And I landed on a woman, and I told the woman, come on, get up. I shook her, and I said, we have to get out of here. She did not move. She did not respond or anything. So, I assumed she was dead.

We have certainly said, from the beginning, that we accept the rule of law, that when the Florida Supreme Court makes its decision on this matter, we will accept that. And what we are looking for is to have that decision made as promptly as possible. STAFF: Two more questions. QUESTION: Mr. Boies, did you say that you had filed your appeal already? And how quickly do you think that it could go, the briefings or hearings or rulings? BOIES: We have filed our appeal in the district court of appeals. As most of you know by now, probably becoming expert in Florida election law and Florida appellate procedure, in a case like this, you file in the district court of appeals and then you ask the district court of appeals to certify it as an important and urgent question for the Florida Supreme Court to review directly. BOIES: We have filed that appeal with the district court of appeals this afternoon. We will await their decision. If they pass it directly on to the Florida Supreme Court, we will file our brief in the Florida Supreme Court promptly. (CROSSTALK) BOIES: I'm sorry? QUESTION: Have you talked to Mr. Gore? BOIES: I came from the courthouse down here. QUESTION: Did you have somebody standing by then to file that appeal, since they did it so fast? BOIES: We had papers ready to file, and we filed them. QUESTION: So you had somebody standing by... BOIES: No. No, we didn't have anybody standing by. We had people in the courtroom. But people left the courtroom and went and filed the appeal. You'll see that the appellate paper is about two pages. It's not an elaborate document that had to be prepared. QUESTION: How likely is the Supreme Court to combine your appeal with its consideration of the U.S. Supreme Court... BOIES: I can't comment on that. The Supreme Court might very well decide that the best way to do this was to combine those two issues. Whether they consider those issues together or separately, though, we would expect them to consider both issues promptly.

The victim told school authorities, and it was a pressure cooker there, which Mr. Moody had no way of knowing, and school officials let these two boys back on the bus -- or let them on the bus. And Mr. Moody had no idea what happened at the school. And like I said, it was a pressure cooker, and there nothing he could have done. He followed school policy. MORGAN: All right, Mr. Moody, final question for you. Will you carry on, driving buses in light of what's happened here? MOODY: I retired, Piers, I retired. At 18 years was enough. MORGAN: This was the final straw for you, was it? MOODY: Yes, yes, it was a big straw too. MORGAN: Well, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Moody, you did nothing wrong at all, and the blame should be attached to the thugs that did the beating. And I appreciate you coming on the show tonight. I wanted to say that to you face to face. I think the flack you're getting is ridiculous. You're a 64-year-old man, and you should not be expected to deal with these hoodlums. But I'm glad the authorities have caught up with them. Thank you both very much indeed for joining us. MCDERMOTT: Thank you. MOODY: Thank you very much. Thank you.

NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (via phone): Well, as you said, the battle is still rages in Tikrit at this stage.

And these of course, it's all happening just as ISIS has announced the name change and in a move seen as pretty bold, the announcement of an Islamic caliphate, an Islamic state. What they're effectively saying, Miguel, is that that border between Iraq and Syria, no longer exists for them. That that territory cross (INAUDIBLE), the geography, made this latest propaganda hit by ISIS so effectively, Miguel, is of course there is truth to that. They do have a pretty substantial territorial footprint between those two countries and that's why the Iraqi government is holding so much hope out this new delivery of Russian fighter jets because it's really just in the sky at the moment that they have any hope of claiming the upper hand in this -- Miguel.

There's got to be a difference. One thing I'm going to tell you that came up with all of the interviews that I did, all of them made great pains to talk about the suffering of the Greek people, they understand the Greek people are under duress. That was largely absent. This is a conversation that's been very technical, about technical measures -- QUEST: Right. LAKE: -- about reforms, not really talking about the pain on the ground. All of them really made an attempt to do that, so there does seem like they're trying to move forward, but the big problem, Richard, is this should have been happening months and months and months ago. They're jamming up against -- QUEST: All right. LAKE: -- the fact that Greece is running out of money quickly. That's really important. QUEST: Maggie's at the IMF in Washington at the spring meetings, where the spring has sprung. Maggie, thank you very much, indeed. Now, the markets as it has settled finally.

You know, I talked with one trader today -- QUEST: Yes. KOSIK: -- who told -- who said it this way: the issues that plague the market today, they're nothing new. They've been hanging around -- QUEST: Exactly. KOSIK: -- for a while. And for some reason, these investors woke up today and thought, you know what? We're going to sell today. And apparently, finally, Greece was on their radar. And that was really the prime reason you saw markets drop so sharply today. QUEST: Right, but if you're -- well, I think you are right, because there's obviously no reason other than Greece and a bit of China. KOSIK: Well, there's more.

Ramzi bin al-Shibh is alleged to have lived in the Hamburg, Germany, al Qaeda cell where three of the 9/11 hijackers resided. It is alleged that bin al-Shibh was originally selected by Osama bin Laden to be one of the 9/11 hijackers and that he made a martyr video in preparation for the operation. He was uncertain -- he was unable to obtain a U.S. visa and, therefore, could not enter the United States as the other hijackers did. In light of this, it is alleged that bin al-Shibh assisted in finding flight schools for the hijackers in the United States and continued to assist the conspiracy by engaging in numerous financial transactions in support of the 9/11 operation. Ali Abdul Aziz Ali's role is alleged to have included sending approximately $127,000 to the hijackers for their expenses and flight training and facilitating the travel to the United States for nine of the hijackers. Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi (ph) is alleged to have assisted and prepared the hijackers with money, western clothing, traveler's checks and credit cards. He is also alleged to have facilitated the transfer of thousands of dollars between the 9/11 hijackers and himself on September the 11th, 2001. Mohammed al-Qahtani is alleged to have attempted to enter the United States on August the 4th, 2001, through the Orlando International Airport, where he was denied entry. It is also alleged that al-Qahtani carried $2,800 in cash and had an itinerary listing a phone number associated with al-Hawsawi. Now that the charges have been sworn, they are being translated into the native language of each of the accused and served on them. I will evaluate the charges and all of the supporting evidence, along with the chief prosecutor's recommendation, and I will forward them with my independent recommendation to Mrs. Susan Crawford, the convening authority for the military commissions. She will review all of the information and make her independent decision whether to refer any or all of the cases to trial by military commission. And, if so, whether to refer them as capital. Just as in military court-martial practice, the pretrial advice must contain my legal conclusions, as well as whether the charges are supported by probable cause, are subject to jurisdiction by the military commission, and should be tried by military commission. The convening authority's final decision follows her review and consideration of my advice, the file provided by the prosecutors, and any national security concerns. This is very similar to the sequence of events that occurs in military legal offices thousands of times a year all around the world. If the convening authority refers the charges to trial, the prosecution bears the burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard applied in all U.S. and military criminal trials.

Greece still hasn't asked for the money. The IMF is working out how much money they might be eligible for and under the European agreement. Is it a done deal and inevitable that Greece is going to ask. Or do you think there is still just a scintilla of hope that they'll get away with it? MORICI: Oh, I don't think there is much hope that the Greeks can get out of this mess on their own. I mean the cost of insuring their debt is rocketing. They are in a situation where they simply have to have a guarantee from the large countries in Europe, and perhaps the IMF to get out. If you go to the IMF you are really getting money from the same place except that indirectly there is Japanese and American contributions. Try to remember the IMF is predominantly financed by the United States, the three or four large powers in Europe, and Japan. QUEST: Peter Morici, joining us from Maryland-from Washington.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) QUEST: Welcome back, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we are live at Newark Airport, where as you can see, a well-oiled clock seems to be the way things are going now. There may not be as many seats as they'd like but, from what I understand and from what we'll hear, in a little while, most passengers are being accommodated on flights today. Goldman Sachs is once again under-in the news, of course, under the question of what did the company do when it sold Abacus '07, the synthetic CDO that is at the heart of the SEC's claim against the Wall Street bank. Maggie Lake joins me now, from New York. Maggie, oh look, this is fascinating because the pendulum continues to swing in terms of how the case looks. What's happened today? MAGGIE LAKE, CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you are right, Richard. It certainly has. You know, at the beginning of the week it was all Goldman on the defense, but there have been a lot of questions about the motivation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the timing of the suit, their politics at play here.

It could be a part of (inaudible) impeachment as with Nixon's interference with the FBI. The obstruction statutes really focused on court proceedings and only if the FBI is working in relationship of a grand jury can there really be an obstruction. So I think you have a technical issue here that if they ever get to impeachment, they would say he interfered with the investigation. LEMON: All right. Stick with me, everyone. When we come back, how Comey's dismissal could affect the Russian investigation. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) LEMON: We're back now. The original reason given for James Comey's firing was his handling of the Clinton email scandal, but President Trump himself contradicted that. Back with me now, Elizabeth Holtzman and John Dean. I want to talk a bit more about this Watergate comparison because the Trump's surrogates sort of (inaudible) themselves. Many conservative (inaudible) themselves saying, wait a minute, it's already comparison to Watergate, that's too much. You say it is fair, Elizabeth. HOLTZMAN: Oh, yes, no question about it. The two things that strike me right away, Watergate involved this break-in to the Democratic National Committee headquarters. That was the burglary. That was covered up. What was the purpose of the burglary? Somehow to interfere with the presidential election that was taking place in 1972. Here we're talking about possible collusion with the Russians over what? Breaking in to Hillary Clinton's campaign, internet, and DNC information, her campaign staff. So to interfere with the election, presidential election 2016. So we have break-ins related to presidential election in Watergate and now. LEMON: You had firings. HOLTZMAN: And then you have the firings, in Watergate, the special prosecutor Archibald Cox wanted tapes, White House tapes that was going to prove whether Nixon knew about the cover up, orchestrated the cover-up. Actually, whether what John Dean said was true or not, the tapes would prove it. Nixon said he can't investigate me. I'm the president. I'm above the law. I'm stopping this. Well, he fired Cox and that brought -- it started the whole impeachment process. We have the same thing now. LEMON: Is there another comparison? HOLTZMAN: Aside from that, it's enough. Stopping the FBI investigation, thinking somehow that if he fires Comey that the investigation will stop. It will not stop. LEMON: Yes. Go ahead John, what do you make of that? JOHN DEAN, FORMER NIXON WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: Well, she left out a couple. We might also have an inoperative press room with what happened with the people that were left hanging out to dry after the president had his Lester Holt interview, so that's another one. I think that the broad comparisons are certainly there. There's been a certain Nixonian style about the way he's done things. They're kind of crude and authoritarian. So, there are some similarities.

But I don't think that he, over the course of time, is going to have that big of a problem because there are plenty of women that are frustrated with Congress, that are frustrated with the government -- FERGUSON: The difference is this, though.

HARLOW: Ben, let me jump in there. I do want our viewers to hear this sound. Just to push back a bit on what Mel was saying. This is from Kate Bonner. She was on my show yesterday. She worked with Trump. She co-authored a book with him back in the late '90s as a young woman. I want you to hear what she had to say about how supportive she believed he's been especially women in business dealings. Let's roll it.

And I never -- I'm sure I'm going to get lambasted for this, but I never saw him or heard him to be a sexist. When I worked at Trump in 1999, more than 50 percent of the senior executives at the Trump organization were women. He was surrounded by powerful women. So it wouldn't be foreign to him if that was the case. (END VIDEO CLIP) HARLOW: Ben? FERGUSON: Yes, I think -- I think she worked for Donald Trump and she made a lot of money working for Donald Trump. HARLOW: She co-authored -- (CROSSTALK) FERGUSON: So I expect her to have great things to say about Donald Trump. But the average woman out there that's going to be asked to vote for him is not making money from working with Donald Trump. It's completely different, you know, paradigm of viewpoints here. One is making money, the other is judging from the outside. And I don't think women are going to connect with that. HARLOW: All right, Mel, Ben, thank you.

How can you -- GOULD: If you let me speak for a second I'll tell you. Most people actually think that when you look at clean tech and the climate bill that it's solely focused around wind and solar, the fact is that there are companies out there that take trinity industries for example, this is a 100-year-old metal bending company, five years ago they decided to continue on producing their rail cars but also producing wind turbine towers. Now they're hiring people. These are green jobs. MOORE: I'm all in favor of your green technologies just don't ask taxpayers to pay for it and there is no way you can make energy -- GOULD: Taxpayers pay for oil? Why shouldn't they pay -- MOORE: You can't make energy more expensive and production more expensive in the U.S. which the climate bill does and expect that to create jobs? It does create jobs; it just creates them in China and India. VELSHI: Oh, we need one of these World Cup whistles.

So, essentially they were gobbled up by the ice and they were saying the ice was about 30 feet high in some areas. All right, over the last several days, exceptionally hot temperatures across the Pacific northwest, but Seattle, no, not today. Your temperatures have been in the 80s the last several days. Today, a high of only 66 degrees.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They roast it. They put some sauce in there. BOURDAIN: That's delicious. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As you can see, people don't eat meat. Meat is quite expensive, almost $2.

BOURDAIN: Soap. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because at least you have to look a bit clean. BOURDAIN: So soap first. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Soap. But in between, as Congolese, you have to think of dressing, looking smart, clothes. All these Congolese you can see here. BOURDAIN: Right.

BRUNHUBER (on camera): In India, one of the epicenters of the pandemic, health experts have long suspected the coronavirus death toll is much higher than the government's official count. And now, a new study finds the disparity in the numbers could be in the millions. The U.S.-base Center for Global Development believes India's death toll can be up to 10 times the official figure, that's close to 5 million people. CNN's Vedika Sud is live in New Delhi. BRUNHUBER: Vedika, as I mentioned all throughout our reporting on this crisis, the COVID statistics in India included -- including the death toll always came with that asterisk, right? That it could be way higher now we're getting exactly an idea of how much. What more are we learning? VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Absolutely, Kim. But what's interesting is at the very outset, the authors of this study have made two things amply clear. One, that the excess death estimates -- are estimates not only of COVID-19 debts, but overall deaths that have taken place because the study begins from 2020, January, and it goes on until June this year. So, those were pre-pandemic times as well that have been included in this data. Secondly, they have also gone on to say that there are limitations to the data that they have access. Now, interestingly, the excess death toll varies from 3.4 million to 4.9 million. Until June this year, India had officially reported 400,000 COVID-19 deaths. Now, in the first instance, this study, in fact, is based on three different data sources. In the first instance, 3.4 million excess deaths as what they are reporting, and this is based on India's civil registry system, a system that actually correlates birth and deaths in a different districts of the country. And they have taken into account seven states, which accounts to almost half of India's population.

2042223,2359096,CNN,New Day,"OK, what do you have to tell us about health care? ENTEN: Yes. So I think that this is fascinating. And I made -- our question was worded a little differently, but I simplified it both for me and for the viewers at home. So there was this whole Democratic debate, right? Should we have a public option or should we have a Medicare for all and only a public plan? And I broke it down by all voters and I broke it down by potential Democratic primary voters. And what do we see here? The Elizabeth Warren/Bernie Sanders position is really not that popular. Only having a public plan, even among Democrats, only 30 percent of potential Democratic primary voters think we should do that, versus 49 percent think we should have private plans and a public option. And among all voters, it's very, very clear, they do not want a Medicare for all option. They want private plans and a public option. But this, I think, is also important, they do want that public option, a majority, 19 percent plus 32 percent gets you over 50 percent. BERMAN: They don't want to lose their private insurance altogether. ENTEN: Yes. BERMAN: That's what the polls show. What else do you have on health care? ENTEN: And I just want to point this out. Specifically, among Kamala Harris supporters, this is very key, even among them, and she's kind of waffled back and forth, but among them, they want the public option. Sixty-six percent of them want that public option. One other thing. They all pretty much raised their hands for government insurance for undocumented immigrants. That's a popular position among potential Democratic primary voters. Sixty-one percent. But among the general electorate, not a popular position. So this is a question, folks, as when they transition to the general election, will they be able to tack back towards the middle? CAMEROTA: Yes. BERMAN: What are you doing for the Fourth of July, Harry? ENTEN: Well, I just want to point out, look at this, happy Independence Day today, sort of. The Congressional Congress actually voted to declare independence on this day back in 1776. It wasn't until two days later in which they actually approved the Declaration of Independence. But this, today, is an Independence Day, sort of. So, Happy Independence Day, Alisyn. CAMEROTA: Thank you. BERMAN: Sort of. CAMEROTA: Let's start celebrating. ENTEN: Yes.

He met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. The Iraqi government says Abizaid came to reaffirm President Bush's commitment to Iraq at a time of political change in both capitals. Al-Maliki is calling for changes in his cabinet, amid growing divisions in the national government.

But observers say the welcome mat wasn't always out for Robert Gates, President Bush's choice for defense secretary. Gates served as CIA director under President Bush 41. DEREK CHOLLET, FELLOW, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Many of those who were part of Bush 41, including the incoming defense secretary, felt as though they had been put on the sidelines over the past few years. SNOW: On the sidelines, maybe, but close to President Bush 41 -- Gates is seen here with his former boss just days before he was tapped to replace Donald Rumsfeld. Add that to the fact that another Bush 41 alumnus, former Secretary of State James Baker, now co-chairs the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, working towards a new strategy in Iraq. TOM DEFRANK, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, ""NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"": The Baker crowd are the pragmatists. Their attitude is: Iraq, for whatever reason, isn't working. We have got to fix this. And I think the Cheney and Rumsfeld wing is basically kind of in the: History will prove us right. SNOW: Some in that Baker crowd were openly critical of the Iraq war plans, notably former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Observers say Gates was not as outspoken. In a 2003 CNN interview, he talked about establishing a new regime in Iraq.

We saw the president speak from the White House, flanked by Americans, speaking about the tweets he's been getting, thousands upon thousands of what sacrifices would you Americans be making if you got 40 fewer dollars in your check if this didn't happen. And then you have been reporting, not often we see the number one Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, on the side of the president. And so that perhaps could have been part of the catalyst to begin what could be a possible deal. BOLDUAN: You could really see it if you were watching this closely of just all the pressure that was mounting for there to be a deal.

And then kind of the mounting pressure of rarely do you see on fellow Republicans criticizing fellow Republicans on such a contentious issue. And then you started seeing more and more Senate Republicans coming out, we want to long-term deal, but we need to push this there. It's irresponsible to not get this two-month extension through even though we all agree that a one year is better than a two- month. And on some level, there has to be the fact that broke the logjam is not only the calendar and timing, is all the pressure that was really mounting. Brooke?

I blame it on the failure to have a transition that was ration and he will. As you know, previous administrations had a significant number of their cabinet confirmed before they were even sworn in. That is the tradition. But we're doing fine. I think we're going to be in good shape. (END VIDEO CLIP) DIAZ: So, he expressed optimism there. He is hopeful that Tanden's nomination can get through the Senate despite the criticism of her past tweets. And they were hoping that Lisa Murkowski would sign on to support him, or to support Tanden for this nomination. But as you pointed out, that she is not looking like she will support Tanden in this nomination. So we'll have to wait and see where Kyrsten Sinema lands on this issue and what the Biden administration decides to do on this nomination. JARRETT: Daniella, it also seems that there is a broader pattern at play here. The White House just simple any can't get cooperation from anywhere. The House will vote tomorrow, of course, on that first big bill of the Biden presidency, the coronavirus relief bill. The public overwhelmingly supports this, but not a single Republican in Congress is publicly on board with it. Congressman Tom Reed, a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus says that the popularity of the bill is going to wear off. Tell that to somebody whose unemployment benefits are about to run out. But you are up there every day, what are your sources saying about what it will take to get Republicans on board with this bill and anything else for that matter? DIAZ: I really want to be clear. Democrats don't need any Republicans to sign on to support this package. And Republican leaders are urging their members not to support this legislation, as you point out, because they feel that it is riddled with proposals that have nothing to do with COVID-19 and that it is very expensive legislation that shouldn't be passed right now after several stimulus packages were passed last year. But again, this is still an issue. Democrats have within their own party to try to pass this legislation. Again, we're keeping an eye on Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin because those two senators who are Democrats have nothing to do with Republican Party have not said whether they would support this legislation with a $15 minimum wage increase. In fact, Joe Manchin wants to propose an $11 minimum wage increase if it turns out that this legislation can't pass budget reconciliation with this $15 minimum wage increase, which, of course, you know, we've talked about a lot on CNN needs to be approved by the Senate parliamentarian who decides",0.0849655292403384,2021-02-25

CHOE: Hey, man. You're welcome. BOURDAIN: And this shit could have been worth some money on eBay, for sure. CHOE: Now I'm definitely ready for Sizzler's. BOURDAIN: Nice. Standing tall and prominent amongst the many Asian and Central American restaurants in the community, one place holds a cherished position in the collective memories of many second- generation Korean- Americans. I am personally unfamiliar with the Sizzler brand. I know it by name, but never have I managed to actually cross its doors. CHOE: After you. BOURDAIN: Thank you. Wow. CHOE: How are you doing today? I'm doing fantastic. I have my Sizzler outfit on. So here's the thing. You can get, like, a steak and then add the salad bar with it. BOURDAIN: Right. CHOE: Get the best bang for your buck or you could just get the salad bar. BOURDAIN: I've got to have a little steak. CHOE: I am going to go traditional and just get just the salad bar. BOURDAIN: Yes. CHOE: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can sit wherever you like. CHOE: Excellent. BOURDAIN: Oh, yes. Oh, now, you're getting Korean on me. CHOE: Yes. Super embarrassed right now because we're in Korea town, and I'm taking you to eat at Sizzler, which, for a lot of Koreans, it's the best food in Korea town. BOURDAIN: So if you eat non-Korean, this was it. CHOE: We never ate out ever, and if we did, it was McDonald's. And if it was a birthday and a special celebration and you want to kick it up a notch and go a little bit more special, then it was Sizzler. BOURDAIN: This is a judgment-free zone, where there are no mistakes. A world to explore in congruous combinations without shame or guilt, free of criticism from snarkologist, because there are no snarkologists at Sizzler. CHOE: Obviously, here's all the accoutrements for making a nice nacho, taco salad, and here's -- BOURDAIN: Right. CHOE: -- all the stuff for -- BOURDAIN: Pasta. CHOE: Pasta, spaghetti, whatever. The move is you get a hard taco shell and put meatballs in it. This is Italian/Mexican dining, and you make a meat ball taco, and there's nowhere else in the world where you can have this.

I think what's important for people to know though is, to play off something that Pattie was talking about, is that perhaps there's going to be more accountability so that then we're going to be avoiding some of these problems that we have seen coming to WorldCom. WorldCom is not a surprise. I mean, we knew several months ago that it was lining up to be a situation that could, in fact, end in bankruptcy. I think one of the things that I like to talk to consumers about, as I do personal finance reporting, is we need to have some resolutions for the problems. And one possible resolution kind of got buried in yesterday's announcement, and that was the push for independent board members. Right now, WorldCom has two independent board members, people who have no history with WorldCom, and people who will hopefully bring some fresh outlook, you know, to the board. That said, I think it could be the beginning of a trend, that other companies, maybe not in trouble or not in trouble yet, would want to do the same thing. CHUNG: Pattie, how do we get the confidence back? SELLERS: Well, the reforms that are being imposed really will help a lot. A lot of these reforms don't kick in until late summer. There's a bill going through Congress right now that President Bush has said he will sign. And once we get these reforms in place, I think it will help in a major way. What we need is confidence back. And I think we just need to get through this rough period, and the market will respond once there's a feeling that there are stricter rules and companies are required to play by the rules. CHUNG: All right. Thank you so much. Appreciate your being with us, Pattie Sellers and Valerie Morris. We'll be right back.

You`re kidding me. Go get a job. Go get a job, Sandra Fluke. (END VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEWS: Why does he have to be Irish? Anyway, so now graduating from a prestigious law school in your early 30s makes you a student for life? By the way, Walsh might very well be out of a job himself when voters hit the polls this November.

Among the soldiers that the Department of Veterans Affairs is seeing from ""Operation Iraqi Freedom,"" one in five is diagnosed with serious mental trauma from war. So we certainly have a trend here that is very troubling. PHILLIPS: Luis, your roommate in the shelter is a 57-year-old Vietnam vet. What does he say to you? Do you guys talk about this? ARELLANO: Oh, yes. We share a lot of conversations, and he - we talk I guess is the best way to do - we can vent. But he's been through this before. He's also homeless, but a very well educated man.

PHILLIPS: Is there anybody - is there any entity, any person, any part of the military that you wish you just would have received something more? Are you blaming anybody? ARELLANO: Well, actually, I love the Navy. I'm Joe Navy, and the Reserve Center has been the most - Sacramento and the Reserve Center at Port Hueneme have been the most supportive Reserve Centers that I've come across. And, you know, if I could do it all over again, I wish I would have stayed a little bit longer to see if I could get some help or assistance, to see if there was that depression, to see if there was a - if my divorce could have been a little bit more smoothing, as far as exiting out from a military perspective into a civilian side. So, you know, sometimes the active side doesn't take care of their own, but the Reserve Center, they're there to catch those who need help, and they're caught in the middle. And I just wish the active side could support the Reserve Centers a little bit more. I mean they call us when it comes to war, and we go out there and do our jobs, but when we come back out, they just say thank you and that's it. And the Reserve Center says, well, if you need us, we're there to support you, but there's so many of us, and they don't have the capacity to take care of everybody's needs.

1117882,1418700,CNN,Starting Point With Soledad O'Brien,"mean if you look at the Tax Policy Center they basically said it's very hard to see evidence of exactly how raising taxes figures into all of this. NORQUIST: Several things. I was talking about President Bush 41 in 1990 when they raised taxes and it was supposed to help us reduce the deficit. In fact, Congress just spent all the money that came in. When politicians raise taxes, whether it's in California, we've seen the devastation there. Illinois, we've seen the damage to that economy, Maryland. When politicians raise taxes instead of cutting spending, you have lousy economic growth. Those states, and you can compare either the Reagan recovery, lower taxes, spending restraints, less regulation versus the very weak Obama economy, wore where he did all the opposite things of Reagan and got everything that an economist would tell you gets bad in an economy. Let's compare state by state. California versus Texas, Illinois versus Florida. You cut taxes you get more growth. You raise taxes you put people out of work and you bankrupt your state. O'BRIEN: We have you for the whole two hours so I want to get to a quick piece of President Obama's op-ed because we already did Governor Romney's op-ed. I'll have you comment on it and then we're going to continue to chat about this all morning. He writes this, ""By the end of President Clinton's second term our economy created 23 million new jobs, incomes rose, poverty fell, deficits became the biggest surplus in history."" And what his point in part of this op-ed is if you look to the last Democrat who he says he's shaping himself in that, in that image, if you will, you know, he was successful in that kind of a strategy. NORQUIST: The first two years of President Clinton's administration weren't terribly interesting. The economy didn't do very well. However, in November of 1994, when the Republicans won the House and the Senate, all of a sudden the stock market started going up, job creation started going up. We got a cut in the capital gains tax, a cut in the capital gains tax, and all of Clinton's spending programs were eliminated. All of the things he was going to spend money on. He was planning on having deficits $200 billion a year, if you look at his budget from '93 and '94. What changed was he lost control of Congress and all of his spending plans were taken off the table. That's when the economy turned around. It's a lot more question of who's in Congress than who the president is. And they're two very different parts of the Clinton administration, one when he had a Democratic congress, not a very good economy. One when the Republicans took the house and Senate. That's when the economy took over.

Not only has that been feudal for them, but in the last several days they've also had a startling lack of success at the state court level.

JOSEPH PINION, CHAIR, CONSERVATIVE COLOR COALITION: I honestly think that this is a major problem for Joe Biden. People always talk about the gaffes. I've said many times that the American people know who Joe Biden is. He is the gaffe man. And I don't think that the gaffes will hurt him provided voters, particularly African-American voters, still believe he is the best person to go toe to toe with President Trump. I think that is the litmus test for most rank and file Democratic voters. I think the issue that he has right now is the fact he has basically built this campaign in almost Noah's Arc style. Where he has Clinton acolytes and Obama acolytes walking two by two trying to make him a candidate he has never been and now that Arc is leaking like the hole of the Titanic. And I think that if he doesn't plug the leaks fast, they're actually going to end up hurting him more than any amount of gaffes ever would. COATES: So, do you see the conversation between President Obama, as indication of that leaking Arc, that he is telling him and signaling to the American people, look, I don't think that you should run based on the gaffes, or otherwise, is he signaling that or is this just a taking out of context conversation? PINION: I don't believe that. I think that realistically if we were saying Obama saying these things in the present, I would think that that would might have been a sign. I think the fact that we haven't heard from Obama is all the indication you need to know that he is actually with Joe. I think that the reality is, that we head down further through this process, that all of these leaks seem to be coming from individuals that are kind of really trying to chip away at who Joe Biden is. And I think if you take almost a broader look at it, if he has look at all these polls, Joe Biden is the one person who has consistently been dominating the polls if polls are to be believed against Donald Trump and he is the one person Democrats have been consistently trying to kill. COATES: You know who else has been very consistent on that poll? Somebody who's actually not in the race, Harry, President Obama. What is that telling us about the fact that there's so support for him and he is not on the ticket, is this a tie to Joe Biden or what does it going to indicate to us? ENTEN: I think it indicates a number of things.

1902458,2218753,CNN,Quest Means Business,"two weeks at the end of the earnings season, the company also bought a big ad tech company. You know, the future of AT&T as it's laid out by Stephenson is a four-part company. Wireless of course is the biggest part, but now it's also a media company and it really wants to be an advertising technology company and that part is really still in its infancy. I think what Stephenson is really trying to say on this earnings though is, give us a minute, we've just taken over ""Time Warner"", now called Warner Media, we're working on bringing content and distribution together and we're going to see it looks like it in the months to come. But in terms of the quarterly earnings, like you said, it's a mixture report, the stocks down 2 percent, but the earnings per share did beat forecast. QUEST: OK, the reality is though, the other parts of this company, the Telco part of it -- STELTER: Right -- QUEST: And the sheer size of AT&T dwarfs in terms of revenue anything coming from the Warner Media. STELTER: Oh, yes, absolutely, I mean, totally, this company in the quarter, 138 billion in revenue, of that the media enterprise is relatively small, but the company is saying that ""Hbo"" had a strong quarter of subscriber growth and that our part of the company Turner which includes Cnn, Tnt, Tbs, et cetera, also has solid -- what they're calling solid revenue in our growth, our sales growth and subscriber growth. Look, the cable business is getting hotter and hotter, and AT&T has a piece of that as well. There are some subscriber declines on the cable business, they're trying to push people into streaming bundles instead and there were some signs of progress this quarter. QUEST: Would you agree that what we are seeing though and witnessing is a great experiment, in the sense that AT&T's bought us and are working out what to do with us in a nice possible way. STELTER: I think experiment is a fair word, look at AT&T versus Verizon, Verizon is a cheap competitor -- QUEST: What happened -- STELTER: And Verizon is going in a very different direction. QUEST: I mean, we had results from Verizon today -- STELTER: Right -- QUEST: They were solid, the stock didn't do any of that. And in fact, if you look at the stock, there's a lot going on, on the Dow -- STELTER: Right -- QUEST: It's done nothing for years. STELTER: Well, Verizon strategy is all about the network. Just improve the wireless network and gain subscribers that way. AT&T is going a different direction trying to bring content together on its network. Verizon though is saying, we don't think we need to buy a media company, we don't need to do anything like that, we're going to go in this technology direction.

And on the Democratic side, you know, there has been talk the last few days of possibly a two-to-one victory for the vice president, talk of Bradley's softness. I don't know. I think the vice president probably needs to hit 60. Anything above that is gravy. WOODRUFF: And if he doesn't, Charlie? COOK: Well, the funny thing is it is logical to say that Iowa, a win, a good showing in Iowa gives you a boost in New Hampshire. It's absolutely logical. Unfortunately, if you look at history, there's not -- you know, it is very, very often in competitive races whoever wins Iowa loses New Hampshire and whoever loses in Iowa wins in New Hampshire, that there's not a lot of linkage there, that people in New Hampshire hardly acknowledge the existence of Iowa. But you have to do well at one or the other. That's for sure. WOODRUFF: Stu, what do you think: If one -- if either Bush or Gore doesn't do as well as some are saying they likely will, what does it mean? Does it mean anything? ROTHENBERG: Well, it means a week or so of second-guessing, forcing them to answer questions as to why they didn't do as well, focus on strategy and tactics rather than message. Neither of them would like that, just as Bill Bradley wouldn't like it. So I think it's a problem, but I think Charlie's right. The nature of the electorate in New Hampshire is fundamentally different than in Iowa. And frankly, New Hampshire voters like the idea that they're quirky enough to correct whatever Iowa has done. COOK: It's sort of like if you either win the division championship or the wildcard. And Iowa's kind of the wild -- you have to win or the other. And if you don't, it's just really hard to see you doing well after that. WOODRUFF: Let's talk about Bill Bradley. How well is he doing here in Iowa? How well does he need to do? And how much does it affect New Hampshire? ROTHENBERG: Well, they set the bar at 31 percent. Since they set it there, we know that's too low. That can't be where the bar is. Most political reporters, if you talk to them, they would think -- they would talk more about 35 percent or so. I think there's been a lot of discussion the last few days about weakness in Bradley. Maybe that lowers expectations. Maybe that's ultimately good for him. Clearly, the campaign has been stumbling. COOK: There's no doubt that Bradley was in a free fall for a week or so, and yesterday I think was a particularly bad day. This morning, he got the ""Des Moines Register"" endorsement.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAVIDGE: Have you been able to serve this court order to any of the four murders that were released on Sunday? JIM HOOD, MISSISSIPPI ATTORNEY GENERAL: Unfortunately, we have not. You know, these convicts got out and hit the road. Some -- we were -- were we shadowing areas we thought that they were located in. We have not been able to serve them at this point. (END VIDEO CLIP) SAVIDGE: This is the problem, of course, not only for law enforcement, but also for many of the victims' families. They fear that these murderers potentially could be a threat to them. That they may want to exact some sort of revenge as a result of the time in prison they spent. Again, authorities last night thought they had an idea where these murderers, these men were, but it turns out today they really don't have any idea. Because they were pardoned, those men were under no obligation to tell the state of Mississippi where they were going or what they planned to do. In fact, it is believed many of them may have left the state. --Randi. KAYE: So what, Martin, are they doing to actually find them? If they don't think they know where they are, I mean what's actually happening on the ground to try and find where they might be? SAVIDGE: Well, they're not sitting on their hands. They do have enforcement officers that are out there canvassing the old neighborhoods, checking up on old address, certainly following family members to see if they have had any contact. But beyond that, as I say, these prisoners, because they were pardoned, this all goes back to the pardon process, they weren't having to tell anybody. There's no parole officer that they had to report to. There is no way to exactly know where they are. And, quite frankly, as the attorney general said, he believes that many of them may have left the state. And if they have, it makes it much more difficult because then the state of Mississippi has no jurisdiction to go and try to get them elsewhere. They would try to have to seek out the help of the federal marshals. But before that, they'd have to come up with a crime to charge them with and they don't have any crime to charge them with. KAYE: So how do locals feel there? I mean I'm sure you've had a chance -- you've spent some time there in the last day or so. What are they telling you? SAVIDGE: Well, there's still a great deal of outrage. It is a combination of things. One, the fact that you have murders and rapists. These are clearly the worst of the worst when it comes to criminal intent that have been set free.

The older voters and the working class voters, those who say that they are worried about the gas prices, losing their homes. Where this economy is going.

I want to bring in Jim Acosta now, because Jim I know you're following the Clinton campaign and how she's responding to all of this. We have seen that she is really seized on this moment, on this debate, we know that the Clinton campaign has been watching for some weeks now to see if Barack Obama would slip up in any kind of significant way that might change this equation. What are you hearing from the Clintons today? ACOSTA: Well, the Clinton campaign has seized on this, you're right, Suzanne.

Where the ocean was probably 100 yards away from us yesterday, now it's coming up probably about 15 yards away, basically covering the entire beach that was there just yesterday -- Fredricka. WHITFIELD: And, Chris, does it appear as though there are still a significant number of people who have made the decision to stay on South Padre Island, who did not evacuate? LAWRENCE: It was kind of hard to hear your question, but if you were asking about people staying or going, I felt like most people -- I'd say it was about 50-50. We saw a lot of people packing up yesterday. We saw one woman who lives right near the shoreline and she said she was just too close. She was worried about the storm surge coming in and flooding her house. So she packed up. She didn't leave the island, but she moved to a different part of the island and like a second or a third story. We've seen a lot of people who are from other parts of Texas decide this isn't the place that they really wanted to try to ride it out. So they decided to move further inland. But a lot of people said well, we're not going to get the eye and they decided to just stick it out at home, put some sandbags up to prevent against some flooding. WHITFIELD: And, Chris, it looked like either a staff member or perhaps even security walking around behind you.

But in some ways if you haven't seen one or been involved in one, it can be somewhat fascinating, too, I mean when you see these huge waves coming into the shore, being right here on the ocean.

I'm wondering, for you, talk to us about the process and how he would weigh, you know, more of a liberal, farther left leaning justice versus maybe a more consensus centrist pick? VLADECK: Sure, Brooke. I mean I think from the president's perspective, the fact that this is Justice Scalia's seat is going to weigh heavily on the consideration for who should replace him. I think we're going to see more of a moderate, more of a centrist nominee than we might have if, for example, Justice Ginsburg had left the court or someone else from the left bloc. And so I think that what's going on right now behind the scenes is the White House is going through the list of folks they've considered in the past, making sure it's up to date, and figuring out which of those nominees makes the most sense in this political climate and for Justice Scalia's seat. BALDWIN: So then what happens then if you have these sort of four and four, four more left, four more right, you know, Supreme Court at the moment, and depending on how long this nomination process lasts, what happens to the affirmative action cases, immigration, health care, that are waiting? VLADECK: Yes, I mean, I think there are a couple possibilities. So one is the justices find some way to break the four-four deadlock. Maybe they find a very narrow ground on which to rule, for example, in the challenge to President Obama's immigration policy. Maybe they simply say the states didn't have standing as opposed to reaching on the merits. But, Brooke, the two other possibilities are to affirm the decision four-four by an equally divided court, that leaves the lower court decision intact without creating a precedent or to simply -- BALDWIN: Let me jump in.

Heck, it kept me out of trouble in elementary, junior high, and high school. So you know, you definitely know the impact that music can have on kids. Did it do that for you as a musician? TABB: Yes, as -- when I was young I lost my grandmother at the age of 12 and got pretty rebellious. And my junior high band director showed a special interest in me and made sure I got in the band, teaching me music. And I wound up traveling the world with the musical knowledge that he give to me. I wound up getting into a lot of brass bands and traveling. So I know firsthand that, you know, it seems wise, when it comes down to keeping you out of trouble. PHILLIPS: Right on.

I want Gaetane Borders to respond to that. BORDERS: Thank you. I mean, a lot of valid points here. Every 40 seconds a child is reported missing, and the vast majority of them are found. However, there is something to be said for common sense. If you interview the parents and they assure you that their child has never run away, they`re 8 years old, they`re out in the rain, God knows where. Why not implement something? The structure of the Amber Alert is flawed. And I`m tired of people saying that this is the way it is. CLAYPOOL: Why are their parents letting an 8 -- why are their parents letting an 8-year-old run out of the house? BORDERS; That`s not the issue. That`s not the issue. CLAYPOOL: Well, the issue is parents need to start... (CROSSTALK) VELEZ-MITCHELL: Hold on. I want to go back to State Senator Vivian Figures.

This bill is going to put in effect the major goal of this it is to make sure that an alert can be put out almost immediately, at least within two hours of that child being reported missing. The fact of the matter is that the Amber Alert is outdated. And it was my -- it is my intention to put something in place that`s going to help protect children; it`s going to help increase the probability of children being found as soon as humanly possible. VELEZ-MITCHELL: Listen, she disappeared at around 4 p.m. She was seen on that surveillance tape at 4:04. Her parents, her family reported her missing that night. So let`s say around 8:30 at night. Had an Amber Alert been issued immediately, then perhaps, would it be fair to say, Elizabeth Espinosa, that two days later she may not have been found behind an abandoned building, asphyxiated, but she might have been found maybe in somebody`s car or maybe walking the street? We don`t know. ESPINOSA: Well, but it`s a very fair question. And I think it`s a fair assessment to say that the outcome could have been different. And I think you just have to increase your odds. Do whatever you can to make sure that we find children that go missing and we do it in that critical 24-hour period.

Here's how we'd handle the trade and balance. I don't think you can keep saying trust me. I've got a plan for it.

And I look forward to working with Secretary Clinton to seize that potential. In the last seven years, we have spent the treasure of our nation-young American soldiers first and foremost, and billions of dollars-to fight terrorism. And yet grave questions remain as to whether or not we have chosen our battles correctly, pursued the right strategy and defined the right goals. That we are engaged in fighting a global insurgency is beyond doubt. But our task is to define the method and means of our response more effectively, and no challenge will be greater in the days ahead than to get this right. Pakistan and Afghanistan are definitively the front line of our global counterterrorism efforts. Having visited several times recently, it is clear that no amount of additional troops will succeed absent the effective instruments of a functioning state. We face a gargantuan task, and to be successful, I believe we must fundamentally redefine our approach. We went into Afghanistan to deny al Qaeda sanctuary. Our goals must be defined by our original mission, by the regional security context, and by the tribal, decentralized nature of Afghan society. I'm eager to hear Senator Clinton's thoughts on the road ahead in Afghanistan. Nor should anyone believe that Iraq is a completed task. Despite the Status of Forces Agreement that sets out a schedule for reduction of US forces, Sunni-Shia tensions, the unresolved status of Kirkuk, the distribution of oil revenues, and setbacks to political reconciliation, each threaten to upend our fragile progress, and they will require active diplomatic engagement by Secretary of State Clinton and the rest of the Obama Administration with Iraq's government and particularly with its neighbors. Iraq, as well as Iran, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza, all require an approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of each of our challenges. We look forward to working with the Administration and with Secretary Clinton on a significantly expanded and vigorous diplomatic effort. In the age of catastrophic terrorism, it is also urgent that I know Senator Lugar joins me in expressing this, urgent that we restore America's leadership on nonproliferation. Whatever our differences, we must reengage with Russia on nuclear security, specifically the START treaty. It is my hope that we will embrace deep reciprocal cuts in our nuclear arsenals-and I'm eager to hear Senator Clinton's thoughts on this matter. Consistent with our security needs, I believe we should set a goal of no more than 1000 deployed warheads - and that goal should be just the beginning. We should also lay the groundwork for ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The last eight years have resulted in increased suspicion of our motives abroad-especially in the Muslim world, where we must do much more to reduce the prevalent and costly perception of an assault on Islam.

There clearly has been more institutional support for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Facebook Libra news really, I think, in the mind of many crypto investors validated the cryptocurrency space in general and Bitcoin first and foremost and then again also a lot of concerns about interest rates where they're heading. You know, they're going to be going lower probably in the U.S. and around the world. We've got bond yields falling, negative bond yields in parts of Europe and Japan. That is good, I think for Bitcoin as well, but Bitcoin is highly speculative and that's not going to change anytime soon. And you have to keep in mind that Bitcoin right now, even around 11,000, that's well below the $20,000.00 or so peak from December 2017, but it's up from $3,700.00 or so at the beginning of the year. So it's just an amazing ride. GIOKOS: Exactly. And Paul, you know, when we hear the Bitcoin bulls talking about where this crypto is going, they're talking about crazy numbers in the next few years, which haven't materialized exactly, so let's just take a look at where you think this is going, very quickly. LA MONICA: Yes, it wouldn't shock me if Bitcoin topped the record high from late 2017 at some point in the next year, but it also wouldn't shock me if it plunged back to $5,000.00. That's the problem. Bitcoin is still this wild unknown for many big investors and obviously average consumers, so it's really impossible to figure out what's next. GIOKOS: Fantastic.

You have experience here of how the self-professed arch negotiator, the U.S. president, might or has in the past dealt with incredibly sensitive issues, not least that of the release of Andrew Brunson. I wonder how your experience in back channeling and dealing with this U.S. administration might inform how it acts next in this case. MATTHEW BRYZA, FORMER SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL COVERING TURKEY: Thank you, that's a great question. In my experience, the professionals in the State Department and elsewhere in the foreign policy establishment worked very hard to get U.S.-Turkey relations back on track. In my estimation, they had come up with an agreement in the late summer, actually mid-summer, in August, that would have led to the pastor's release along with some other things happening. And there was a decision taken by President Trump in August to go a different way and to issue some tweets that were threatening towards Turkey, impose sanctions against two ministers as well as double the aluminum and steel tariffs. That blew up the whole process. So essentially that tough negotiating stance which was being hailed in the Oval Office yesterday actually resulted in the pastor spending a couple more months under house arrest. How does that impact what's going on now? I think a similar thing is probably going on. There are cool-headed people in the foreign policy establishment, who are trying to think through what the next steps could be. President Trump is reluctant for a number of reasons, investment interests, Saudi swing producer status in oil at a time where President Trump really doesn't want to see high gasoline prices before the midterm elections.

The White House said the leaders did not discuss classified information at their dinner table. Let's get much more on this. Our Matt Rivers, joins us live from Seoul in South Korea. Matt, domestic matters aside, we need to talk about how President Trump responded to this news of the North Korea missile launch, and the Mar-a-Lago diplomacy, as well. How did South Korea, how did Seoul, respond to this? MATT RIVERS, CNN ASIA-PACIFIC EDITOR: Well, we haven't seen any official response from the government here in South Korea, other than to say they're ready and willing to work with their American counterparts at the U.N. to make sure that punitive actions are levied against North Korea for their provocations. And say what you will about Donald Trump's actions at the dinner table there with the Prime Minister of Japan, but people have criticized him for not coming out after the Japanese prime minister said something in a statement, he had a very short statement, saying he supported the Japanese. And in a press conference with Justin Trudeau, he brought up North Korea only saying he would deal with them very strongly. And some in the international community said there should be a stronger response from the president and he should be out there really laying out his administration's agenda for dealing with the North Korean crisis. But on the flip side of that, others would argue he is still just getting into his presidency. They're still trying to figure out exactly how to responds here. And don't forget, there were some 24 other ballistic missile tests in 2014, from January to October, and every time you saw an immediate- range missile launched in the Obama administration, you didn't see President Obama come out to the East Wing or the Rose Garden and deliver a statement every time. So, what proponents would say is look, the Trump administration is responding in an appropriate way given what North Korea did. So, obviously, you have two competing sides, some wanting President Trump to say more, some thought he was reacting in a measured way, but here in South Korea, no official response from the government.

The choice issue is huge for the Democrats. There are so many single women who come to Washington to work in the nation\'s\ncapital and end up living in Virginia. It is safer, nicer, you know all the reasons. And they\'re all pro-choice women.

Than it is like,\nsay, Philadelphia or Maryland.\n \n\n And so I think the state has a did I could the dichotomy. Webb\'s great advantage as a candidate, Chris, is not only\nis he doing well in Northern Virginia where the sentiment against George Bush and George Allen who has just done everything\nthat George Bush has wanted is strong, but he has real appeal as a Scots Irish person from the military in places like southwest\nVirginia.\n \n\n So what we\'re finding in the poll is that Webb has strength across the board. Obviously, Allen has made a whole number\nof miscues. But interestingly, the desire for change in Virginia is strong. It is a military state.

I think it showed. I thought he was entirely too deferential last night, deferring to Hillary Rodham Clinton on a number\nof occasions. He didn\'t seem to be himself and the reason why it was even more conspicuous was because he had been gaining\nmomentum over the last few weeks or so with the Iowa caucuses, coming in second place in New Hampshire, really making a statement\nthat he was going to make a run for the presidency.\n \n\n I thought that the momentum was favoring him tremendously and he took a significant step back because I think that he\nwas looking at his own community looking at him, and he started wondering about himself, and we saw trepidation on his part\nfor the first time.\n \n\n MATTHEWS: Interesting assessment.

The (INAUDIBLE) to have here is there is a group of ten men who have recently come forward to say and this has been acknowledged by the church, that they were sexually abuse to buy a group of priests at a church-run orphanage in the 1980s and 1990s. This has been a devastating story for the church here in part. Because one of the victims later went on to commit a horrific murder, one of the more spectacular crimes. HOLMES: Hey, hold on a second -- all right, I think he's still with us and we had an issue there with the phone. But I think you're still with us, John. Oh, we did lose John Allen. But he's giving us an idea and kind of walked us through it a little bit. But the tiny island nation of Malta is where the Pope is. You're just seeing some video here. But he's in a two-day visit. And allegations have popped up here in Malta like it popped up in several other places across Europe in the past several weeks and months even after the Pope had actually issue a letter apologizing for abuses over time in Ireland. All these allegations start to pop up and now after that, Malta and here you're seeing some video of the Pope on this two-day visit. But he has met with eight of these ten abuse victims. These are ten men who apparently and he says, the church has acknowledged these. So not allegations anymore, so the church is acknowledging that, in fact, it did happen. These ten men during the '80s and '90s who are in an orphanage were abused by priests. And the Pope has met with eight of the ten. Our John Allen, we're trying to establish the line, but maybe we'll get him back. But again, the Pope, significant -- this has happened before, of course, the Pope meeting with victims but now we are hearing once again that it's happening and this time happening in Malta.

They walked up to me and said this was our boardwalk. This is what's left of it. I want to show one other thing, Wolf, as people digest this scene, the board walk torn to shreds as this part. You see these two buildings here? The middle building there was actually a husband, wife, and a daughter who tried to ride out the storm in the midst of that. I had a chance to talk to him. He wouldn't go on camera. He is just too emotional to talk about it, but they were going to ride it out. At 7:30 in the morning, he said the ocean wave was basically knocking on his front door. And about an hour later, blew through his front door. So he tries to plywood up the door and house. Next thing you know they are taking up their valuables to the highest point of the home they can and finally they had a neighbor nearby that said you have got get out of there. And they finally rode it out, but their home is devastated and now there is yellow tape up. The fire department was here a little bit earlier and there was a strong smell of gas. Not safe to be around. That is the devastation that people are dealing with -- Wolf. BLITZER: Any word on damage estimates in the Atlantic City area? GALANOS: You know, it has been pretty tough.

You see some of the water, but not that horrific devastation we're used to seeing in storm surge flooding where you have water up to roofs of houses and things like that. It's tough to get a full estimate. They did a pretty good job getting everybody out of here. And some of the worst devastations, what I'm standing on right here, this northern part of the boardwalk and one last thing, you mention the boardwalk we all know. That is pushing this way. That pretty much made it out here unscathed. You see some of the scenery here from the north looking towards the south.

The new Justice Department report reveals that dozens of terror suspects, none of them on the list, may have actually passed through U.S. airports without notice. Meanwhile, thousands of innocent people mistakenly named on the list are delayed or barred from flights. Our own Drew Griffin found out that his name was on the list. He was stopped repeatedly trying to board flights. We reported on this a lot last year. Tonight, he's ""Keeping Them Honest."" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Finally, someone in Washington has figured out what a reporter in Atlanta, an airline pilot in Alaska, a former U.S. attorney from Michigan, and an 8-year- old in California already knew. (on camera) Are you a terrorist? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know. GRIFFIN (voice-over): Well, most of us knew, anyway. We are not terrorists, even though every time we went to the airport and tried to check in for a flight, we were being told we were on a terrorist watch list. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You are on the watch list. GRIFFIN (on camera): A watch list? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. GRIFFIN (voice-over): A just-released inspector general's report found 24,000 of us were on the FBI's terror watch list by mistake. Like former U.S. attorney James Robinson. JAMES ROBINSON, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: So it seems, for years now. GRIFFIN: Those caught up in that watch list nightmare, hassled for years at airports, did complain. They sent in paperwork to try and get off. And it didn't work. Denise Robinson, whose son James was on the list, found out it was such a known joke among the airlines that a few bucks to a sky cap could suddenly make the list go away. DENIS ROBINSON, JAMES' MOM: My son here is on the terrorist watch list. Can you help us? And now this sky cap will say, ""Sure."" They'll, you know, do whatever they need to do. And he comes back, and he'll say, here's your boarding pass. GRIFFIN: That may seem funny, but there is a very serious problem with the list, as well. While many of us non-terrorists were caught on it, some real terror suspects were not. The inspector general surveyed more than 200 terrorist cases over the past two years and found 35 suspected terrorists were left off the list, creating a risk to national security. The FBI, which controls the list, says it has adopted all 16 of the inspector general's recommendations to improve the list, trying to make sure the real bad guys are on it and the rest of us aren't.

Is there another way to restructure these if President Trump wants to continue doing them? But of course, you know, all of this comes down to what the president wants.

I think these projections of electoral calamity saying they're going to be tarred with a vote and it's going to cost them their seats, this is what democrats want republicans to believe. But there's not a shred of evidence that following through on a campaign promise that led to republican majorities in Congress is going to cost anybody a seat next year. (CROSSTALK) LEMON: Let her respond. GRANHOLM: Seventeen percent of Americans like the versions of the republican plan, the Affordable Care Act has a majority approval rating now. Campaigning and voting on something that has 17 percent approval rating and even if you look purely at Trump voters only, it's 25 percent approval rating. It is at astronomically, if you can, I'm mixing the metaphor, low, abysmally low numbers. It is not a good strategy. It is not a good thing to ask them to walk the plank on. And I mean, you know, maybe the rules of politics don't apply anymore. I agree with you on that, given this president. But I think that when you're talking about real people and not just political projections, when you are talking about potentially 32 million people losing their healthcare, that is not just a guess. That is real for them. LEMON: You talked about the polling on Obamacare versus the republicans' bill. Let's listen to this because the president talks about Obamacare. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For the past 17 years, Obamacare has wreaked havoc on the lives of innocent hard working Americans. Behind me today, we have real American families, great families. Just spent a lot of time with them who are suffering because seven years ago, a small group of politicians and special interests in Washington engineered a government takeover of health care. Every pledge that Washington democrats made to pass that is bill turned out to be a lie. It was a big, fat, ugly lie. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: By the way, it's been seven years, not 17. What's your reaction to him calling it a big, fat, ugly lie? GRANHOLM: The big, fat, ugly lie is that President Trump said he would not take people's healthcare away, that he would lower their premiums and both of those are going to be false, a big, fat, lie if in fact this goes through in the Senate.

""The New York Times"" reports the president ordered his lawyer to stop Jeff Sessions from recusing himself. The paper also reports Robert Mueller is aware and on top of that. A Sessions aide approached a congressional staffer for negative information on Comey just before his firing. A bombshell book released painting a wild picture of chaos within the White House. The author of that book says that people all around Trump think that he is unfit and acts like a child. We have also learned that a psychiatrist went to Washington and briefed mostly Democratic lawmakers on the mental fitness of the president. In that book, Steve Bannon, once the president's chief strategist, rips the president and his family, including calling the Trump Tower meeting treasonous, and says Mueller's probe is focused on money laundering. Speaking of the firm behind the dossier, publicly warns Congress, look into the president's past dealings, business dealings, specifically with Russia. The president, responding to Bannon, releases this extraordinary statement, blasting him, saying that Steve Bannon has lost his mind. And he also pins a new nickname, Sloppy Steve. The president's lawyers take the extraordinary step of trying to squash Bannon and the book issuing a cease-and-desist letter to both Bannon and the publisher.

KOSIK: All right, Jim, thanks for that. The feuds we saw in the race for president at the Republican debate are intensifying. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz fight yet another round in the immigration battle they launch on the debate stage. In the meantime, Jeb Bush attacks Donald Trump as entertaining but not serious after a love fest breaks out between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. You know, it is interesting to see, Boris, how this is playing out. First of all, Trump is saying with this love fest coming out and saying it is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond. It is kind of strange because you think about it. Vladimir Putin is not exactly a saint. We saw Jeb Bush certainly seize the moment. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEB BUSH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't respect Vladimir Putin. He is the leader of an important country. Certainly not a regional power as Barack Obama called him, but to get praise from Vladimir Putin is not going to help Donald Trump.

Do people realize exactly who we are talking when we talk about Vladimir Putin and the support that he is giving to Trump and the love fest Trump is giving back? KOSIK: All right, Donald Trump certainly outlasting a variety of controversies. His ship is still sailing despite all the controversies that keep going after him. I think it is interesting the way that Bush is approaching this, treating Trump like a celebrity. Saying he is entertaining, but he's not serious. At the debate, he went after him continuously saying he is not serious and that he is not really a viable candidate in a general election. It will be interesting to see how Jeb approaches this in terms of the pledge of support that no matter which Republican candidate gets the nomination, whether or not Bush will continue supporting him. It is something his campaign has explored in several states. Will Bush support Trump if he does get the nomination? It's a big question mark.

But now like so many across the U.K., there are those in Cornwall who are rethinking that decision, as CNN's Phil Black reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The people of Cornwall are known for being independently minded. In the local fishing industry, well, it is no secret that many fishermen don't like the European Union's common fisheries policy. Despite all that, it came as something of a surprise when Cornwall voted heavily in favor of Brexit. That's because this region of the United Kingdom has benefited significantly from E.U. development money. It's a net beneficiary. It gets back a lot more E.U. money than it puts in. In fact, hundreds of millions of pounds over many years have been invested in local infrastructure and have helped local businesses get started. It has made a real difference to the local economy and the quality of people's lives. It is money that Cornwall qualified for because, under the E.U.'s classification systems, it was deemed to be among the most deprived corners of the European Union. Despite that, walk around the streets of Newquay in Cornwall and you will meet people who are still committed to Brexit, who want it immediately and even want it in a no deal scenario. We have also been talking to people who have had something of a change of heart, people who voted for Brexit, voted to leave but now say they would like another go at the question.

We're the second or third highest payor into everything that is going on and what do we get out of it? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The sooner we can get out, the better, with a deal or with no deal. BLACK: The figure shows apparently there's tens of millions of pounds a year that goes into this region from the E.U. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Never realized it was that much. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I honestly think that they should back Theresa May and not just (INAUDIBLE). UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think we should do try and stay in. I think it is too late (INAUDIBLE) place now. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think there should be another referendum. I think there should be a chance for us to really understand what is going on. There's a lot of promises, a lot of what I call fanfare. No one really knew what we were doing.

Let's bring in Alan Diehl (ph), he is a former U.S. NTSB human performance expert, also and the author of ""Air Safety Investigators: Using Science to Save Lives One Crash at a Time."" Alan, thank you so much for being with us. I don't know if you got to hear just a bit of the exchange that I had with Rosemary and Cyril about this but, you know, the big question right now, how do you get an airport like this back up to full operation? ALAN DIEHL, FORMER NTSB EXPERT: Well, a lot of things are going to have to happen and it probably won't occur in an hour or two. We're talking about a lot of things that have to happen. Obviously, the FAA will reestablish what they call flow control; they're I'm sure beginning release aircraft from ground holes. But for all the failures and problems and expenses that will be incurred because of this and hopefully lessons learned, in many ways this was a success story. We didn't see any examples or air rage, or I guess you'd have to call it ground rage. From what I've heard, so from a psychological standpoint it seems like most of the people, while inconvenienced and some of them angry, stayed calm, cool and collected. Now clearly there's a lot of things that could be addressed and should be addressed; for example, battery powered public address systems and also a better use of the Internet to at least keep the people informed as to what the officials were trying to do. So I think in many ways, this was a success story amongst a series of failures -- George. HOWELL: Alan, it is important to point out, from what we understand from city officials, no one is injured, no one hurt. When you consider how many massive planes come into this airport, so many coming in, the simple fact no one injured, no one hurt and, right now, people stranded, that's the good news, that no one was hurt. But let's talk about the cause. As we understand it at this point, a fire, a Georgia Power underground electrical facility, what do you make of that? And the fact, Alan, that this affected these redundant systems? DIEHL: Clearly, Georgia Power overlooked what system safety engineer engineers call a single-point failure. Because the fire spread to the backup, as I understand it, switching system. And so they (INAUDIBLE). That should never happen. Clearly there was a failure on the part of, I think, the designers of that system. So hopefully there is a lesson learned there. And I'm sure they'll move quickly to remedy this. But there's probably similar situations or maybe in many other airports. So hopefully this will lead to a review of all these power systems and their backups.

That says to me that he's giving al Qaeda a license to respond against American and perhaps Israeli interests in a domain much broader than the current conflict here in Lebanon -- Wolf. BLITZER: How much of this is related, this strain in the past, at least, al Qaeda being largely Sunni dominated, Hezbollah largely Shia dominated. The sectarian strain that's clearly evident between Sunnis and Shia in Iraq, how much is spilling over among various terrorist groups? WARE: Yes Wolf, you very much hit the point here. I mean, that is the natural schism between these groups. There's also issues about doctrines, tactics, methodology. But fundamentally, this is a sectarian divide. Now, in the early days of al Qaeda, we knew they operated in Afghanistan in the 80s alongside Shia groups, but as al Qaeda developed and matured, as increasing Egyptian influence came to hold sway, there was a growing anti-Shiaism. But within classic al Qaeda, that led by Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri himself, that's always been moderated at least to some degree. I mean, we see an ongoing, complicated relationship with Iran. However, this new generation of al Qaeda that -- for which Zarqawi, recently killed by American forces, was the midwife, is vehemently anti-Shia. That would clearly be playing in here with Hezbollah. However, don't discount the common enemy being Israel. Al Qaeda has never really had traction on the Israeli issue, the Palestine issue. They are looking to capitalize on this now, but I suspect it won't be in the area itself. BLITZER: It gets rather complicated, all these moves. Thanks very much, Michael Ware on the scene for us in Beirut. Now to some new diplomatic moves.

He's covering all of this, just back from Rome where the secretary of state apparently didn't have such great success in the diplomatic front. What are you hearing about the latest maneuvers to try to see diplomacy work? JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, what you see right here in the region today is a public display of the disagreements that prevented a deal on a cease-fire at the emergency Rome summit. Several top European Union officials and European officials are here in the region for meetings with Israeli officials, meetings with Palestinian officials, and others. I want you to listen. This is a top diplomat from the European Union.

The president canceled his last trip citing a lack of progress on denuclearization. Pompeo will also travel to Japan, South Korea, and China. All right. Trade tensions hitting automakers. Car sales saw a steep drop as the threat of auto tariffs loom. Overall car sales fell 7 percent in September, Ford, Toyota, and Nissan all down at least 10 percent. One reason, demand for new cars is lower than last year. That's when Americans rushed out to replace cars destroyed in Hurricane Harvey. So, a tough comparison. But also fear of tariffs on car imports prompted many shoppers to buy cars earlier in the year. Car companies face slowing sales just as costs rise. Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are raising those prices. And the new NAFTA, now called the USMCA, creates higher labor and environmental standards for the industry, likely means higher costs. Rising interest rates slowing sales. Interest rates affect borrowing costs like auto loans, auto loans get more expensive. BRIGGS: Some industry experts think the result of NAFTA 2.0 is moving more car production out of North America to avoid all of this. ROMANS: Could be, could be. It depends. BRIGGS: We'll see.

Well, it's a chemical that can be found in everything from water bottles to cans of peas, and according to a new study it might cause behavioral problems in our kids. Senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen is joining us to tell us exactly what the study found. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: This study looked at a chemical called BPA Kyra which has been in and out of the news for a couple of years now. And what they found is that pregnant moms who ingested the highest amounts of BPA, they were the most likely to have daughters who would later have behavior problems sometime before the age of 3. And it was really an incredible finding, because the more they got of this, the higher the likelihood that a kid would have a problem like autism or attention deficit disorder. PHILLIPS: So where do you find that? What products? And what -- I mean. COHEN: How do you avoid it, right? PHILLIPS: Yes exactly. COHEN: Right, right. Well, let's take a look at the collection of products we have here. It's in all sorts of plastic products. Food products and water -- bottled water -- water bottles, rather. And you know a lot of people don't know this Kyra, but tin cans have a lining on them. They have a plastic lining because of course you don't want your food to taste like tin. So there's a plastic lining, and a lot of those linings have BPA in them. So what you want to do is you want to take a plastic and flip it over and see if there's a number 7 on the bottom. And 7 is the one that is the most likely to have BPA; 3 also sometimes has BPA. And here are a couple of other hints for avoiding BPA if that's something you want to do. What you also want to do is you can just avoid tin cans altogether or just avoid canned food altogether if you're pregnant and worried about this. You should also dispose of BPA plastic that has scratches in, because those scratches help the BPA leach out. The same reason you don't want to microwave BPA, it helps the BPA leach out. And of course look for BPA plastic -- BPA free products. Now the folks who make plastics, Kyra, say that we are worried about nothing and all these plastics are fine. PHILLIPS: All right, so we're basically talking about when we're pregnant. I mean obviously we want to avoid things like this that have baby food in them or -- or something that were actually given directly to our child once they're born.",0.4364996919373558,2011-10-24

(CROSSTALK) SANDOVAL: Yeah, actually what happened over the weekend here, not far from where we are, the city of Brownsville, Texas, this was a facility owned and operated by southwest key programs, which is contracted by the government to take care of these children. We understand based on information coming from officials that a 15-year-old Honduran boy walked off that facility here. You may wonder why -- how that was possible. Well, that organization released a statement, saying that they are not a detention center. They are simply a care facility for these children. So they are not allowed to even put their hands on these children, simply ask them to remain on the premises, but those children are free to come and go, which brings up a very important issue. If these kinds of private entities, these private caretaking organizations that are assuming responsibility for these children, then should they at least have that authority to force these children to remain in place? So that is certainly part of the debate that is happening here. We can tell you however, that that 15-year-old child, according to information from sources close to the investigation, did make it across the border to Mexico. We're told that this child is speaking to his relatives and is in the process of making his way back to his native Honduras. STOUT: Yeah.

Not just in terms of procedures, but also follow-up. SEARS: Absolutely. And we're partnering with them, so that does involve close coordination.

Why would so many patients show up like that? SEARS: So sometimes it's hard to tell. Some patients are wanting a second opinion.

GUPTA: I'm doing fine. How are you? MAXWELL: Well, just bored. GUPTA: You're bored? They spent last night onboard the comfort, and today Marlene is having her thyroid removed. It's an operation she's waited three years for. It's finally going to happen in one of the 12 operating rooms on the ship. GUPTA: Are you excited? Are you nervous? MAXWELL: I was nervous, but not anymore. GUPTA: If you didn't have this operation ever, what would happen to you? MAXWELL: It would turn into cancer and kill me. GUPTA: That's what they told you?

Meantime, Mr. Trump has been all over New York, railing against the Republican Party and the ""rigged delegate system"" that his supporters fear may deny him the nomination. The head of the RNC talking to CNN just a little while ago saying, you know what, this system, it's not broken. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REINCE PRIEBUS, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: It was the same system that put Abraham Lincoln into office. No, I think the system is working, and all the delegates that are bound to the candidates will stay bound to the candidates. No one is losing any bound delegates whatsoever.

They first have to go through the Judiciary Committee, then to the House and the Senate. Trent Lott and Connie Mack will be presenting it on the Senate side. So it is an unusual circumstance, and quite often we don't see those. COSSACK: Can I just interrupt -- let me just interrupt you for one second... ROS-LEHTINEN: Sure. COSSACK: ... and, perhaps, if I could draw you out on why you believe this is such an unusual circumstance. This, after all, is a young boy that does have father in Cuba; he has a relatives here. This, perhaps, is not unlike many Cubans who come to this country, and yet I don't understand -- I don't see why anybody -- or in the past, why no one has filed a special bill on their behalf. ROS-LEHTINEN: Well, unless you are a criminal, here in the United States, no one has been deported to Cuba except for criminals. Unfortunately, we have an executive in the White House, wants to treat Elian as if he were a common criminal. He is the only boy who would be deported in this way. He is already here on land. To take the extraordinary steps to deport him is what makes this a special case. Were it any other case, I think that it would be fine for Elian to stay, and we would not see this eagerness of the executive branch to deport him. In the past, the only people who have been deported are criminals. To treat Elian like a criminal is the White House making this an unusual case, and I think that that's why we've had these unusual circumstances taking place. COSSACK: All right, let me just interrupt you for one... ROS-LEHTINEN: If it were anyone else in the White House, perhaps he wouldn't be thinking about being deported. COSSACK: All right, Congresswoman, let me interrupt you for just one second. Paul Virtue, is that exactly what the Immigration has done, is treat him like a criminal and is deporting him? PAUL VIRTUE, FORMER GENERAL COUNSEL, INS: I think we have to put this into context. We have to remember that what is happening -- the Immigration Service decision was wholly outside of a deportation context. The INS has decided that the child has a -- is voluntarily deciding to return to Cuba, and so he's effectively withdrawing an application for admission. And the way they decided that was to honor the wishes of the father. So this is outside of the deportation context. COSSACK: All right, let's take a break. Up next, yesterday's ruling was heralded in Miami as a popular court decision, but was it legal? We'll have more on the case of Elian Gonzalez when we come back.

In New Mexico, one of those three Western battleground states, President Obama has a 5-point lead now -- I say he wins New Mexico -- 45- 40, with the state`s former governor, Gary Johnson running as a Libertarian at 7. That`s dangerous. And that`s according to a new poll from ""The Albuquerque Journal."" We`ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MATTHEWS: Back to HARDBALL.

We believe in Social Security. We believe in work for the unemployed. We believe in saving homes. Cross our hearts and hope to die, we believe in all these things.

Police believe the ringleader of the operation was just hours away from launching another suicide attack. And tonight, they've identified a new terror suspect. OK? So, take a look it a him. Martin Savidge is in Paris with more. So, Martin, who is this Mohamed Abrini? MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: He is considered to be a driver that took part of this attack. In other words, you had the terrorist, you had those who directly fired weapons, detonated the suicide vest. But there were also the people that had to do the kind of logistics and these are the people that had to take the suicide bombers to the stadium, and in this particular case that's what believed happened. So, that's essentially what he is being described as, as a driver or functionary. It doesn't make him any less comfortable in this terrible, terrible event. So, that was his initial role. And it's very interesting that authorities have a picture of him and then the other most wanted man, that Salah Abdeslam at a gas station, two days before the attack in France. So, here you got two prime suspects, both alive, it is believe by authorities at least at this point and now very much wanted by the authorities. Don.

The light of which has not really been revealed. Safe to say we have discovered though that the threat came from overseas, from Frankfurt, Germany, an I.P. address from Frankfurt, Germany and that it contained missed spelling particularly of the word ""allah"" without a capital letter. Significant to those in New York who have said the treat that they received that seems similar to the Los Angeles threat did not prompt them to close the 1600 school in the New York school district and keep the 1 million plus children in a New York school district. But in Los Angeles a different story, a concern that was brave enough to them to keep all of those children home and to send them back if they had already left for school that dozens upon dozens of school busses on route to pick up children returning to base and staying depart today. We have no idea how long this will last, if the children will go back to school tomorrow. But make no mistake if you're a parent, you know that children staying home from school means your routines are completely upset as well, so this affects millions of people. I want to give you a statement that we've received from the Mayor of Los Angeles. Erick our study releasing this statement, just a short time to go and I will quote him, ""I understand the concerns, families must feeling this morning, but it is critical we remain calm. This decision has been made by the school district in and abundant of caution, as mayor we have shared our support and our intelligence and the Los Angeles police department is working in collaboration with the school district, school police to fully investigate this threat, we've also asked our emergency operations center to be activated and we have ranged for MTA that's the transit system in Los Angeles area to help out by providing free buss rides to all of those school district students, we will continue to monitor this situation nothing is more important to me than the safety of our families.""

With me is Derek Thompson, staff writer for ""The Atlantic"", author of the ""Work in Progress"" newsletter. He's also the author of ""Hit Makers"". Derek, great to see you. You write about the media -- media consumption works, how it affects people, what they read. I have a lot of sympathy for viewers right now who are getting -- not necessarily contradictory signals but a lot of information, confusing information about these new variants. DEREK THOMPSON, STAFF WRITER, THE ATLANTIC: Yeah, I do too. I have a lot of sympathy for them as well. There's a new Netflix satire by Adam McKay out called ""Don't Look Up,"" which is a satire about global warming which a lot of think is about COVID as well. It's movie that stars Leo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep. It's about some scientist that's seen asteroid is about to hit the earth and the media wants to ignore the story. And the whole idea is consistently ignoring things as obvious as an asteroid in a telescope lens. But I think we just learned is that the vast majority of stories aren't like a clear high-definition picture of an asteroid in a telescope lens. A lot of time that image is blurry, right? We don't know if it's an asteroid, or a dove, or a raven or a balloon. And right now, a lot of people are trying to figure out, what exactly is the shape of this omicron threat? And it's not particularly clear. One quick point, meteorologists -- not most journalists but meteorologists have a way of talking about predictions that involve percentage odds of certainty. They say 40 percent chance of rain, 90 percent chance of high wind. It might be nice for us to sort of steal that in epidemiology reporting and future reporting saying, we have 90 percent certainty this is more transmissible but only 6 percent certainty it's less severe. I think those percentage odds might help people. STELTER: Right. That's very interesting. Try to get people the best data necessity can. Now, we know there are different audiences the media is programming and producing for. When I'm on CNN, I feel like I'm speaking to a vaccinated and increasingly boosted audience. If I were speaking on Fox News, it might be 50/50, half the office is vaxed, half is not. Do you feel like the vaccinated media is doing an effective job and whether we're talking to? THOMPSON: I think we're doing an okay job. The way I think about it is there are three circles of risk, con centrist circles. In the center circle there are people like me and you. People who are boosted in their 30s, 20s, 40s, and I really think it's important to point out everything we know about the omicron chain suggests boosted individuals simply do not same the same risk they did from the OG coronavirus in March 2020.

We heard rumors for a while that Iraq was going to be carved up into four sectors.\nJordan taking one, Turkey taking another, and things of that nature. Do you envision new borders in the region?\n \n\n AL-TAEE: No, this is another lie of those who opposed the war. They`ve said a lot of lies. They said this is about oil.\nThey said this is about Islam versus Christianity. They have said that the terrorists will come here and savage us in the\nsuicide bombs. Well, they`ve been proven wrong, and now the Iraqi people have spoken in Baghdad and they have welcomed the\nAmerican flag and welcomed the coalition forces. I think this is a big lie. Iraq is one. Iraq will be a very progressive state.\nThe Shia of Iraq believe in separation. Ayatollah Hakeem (ph), and Ahmad Chalabi, and Najif Al-Salahi (ph), Ahmed Kubba, Vesamil\nHossaini (ph), these are all Shia who have said Iraq will stay together and Iraq will not be divided.\n \n\n SAVAGE: What about the oil? We kept hearing no blood for oil, which was a big lie.

Who is going to control the oil?\n \n\n AL-TAEE: Well, the oil is going to be controlled by the Iraqi government, the interim government, and also be controlled\nby the freely elected democratic government of Iraq. Only the Iraqi people and their representative government should control\nthe oil of Iraq.\n \n\n SAVAGE: Do you think -- I know we`re looking far ahead -- do you think the prices of oil worldwide will come down and\nthe average American will go to the pump six months from now and see a drastically reduced price of gasoline?\n \n\n AL-TAEE: I have no doubt in my mind about that.

Talking to people, they say the court is active and engaged. The problem is there's no advocate representing the public or representing the other interests. It's basically the FBI or the Justice Department saying we need this and then the judges say whether or not that's a good idea. BANFIELD: All right, Joe Johns, thanks for keeping an eye on it for us. Good to see you. Thank you, sir. Good lawyer, too, by the way, Joe Johns. Got a couple of sharp words for the British government from ""The Guardian"" reporter who broke the news about the surveillance program. Glenn Greenwald's partner was detained under an anti-terror law for nine hours at London's Heathrow Airport as he was just traveling through. Greenwald and David Miranda spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST, THE GUARDIAN: All it did, as I said this week, is give them a huge black eye in the world and make them look thuggish, interfering in the journalism process, creating international incidents with the government of Brazil, which is indignant over what was being done, for no benefit at all to themselves, which is why I said I truly believe they will come to regret what they have done. It's just, aside from being oppressive and dangerous, it's also quite incompetent and really quite dumb. (END VIDEO CLIP) BANFIELD: Wow. That's pretty strong stuff. British officials say they had the right to do what they did. But Greenwald and Miranda are suing and asking for a declaration that what authorities did is illegal. They are asking for the return of the computer and the electronics items confiscated in this incident. A whole lot more coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BANFIELD: A little bit of breaking news for you. A pretty significant day when it comes to WikiLeaks. The guy responsible for harvesting all that information and passing it over the WikiLeaks, Bradley Manning, one of our soldiers he was sentenced. He could have faced a long sentence, to 90 years. The military judge said 35. 35 years in prison, dishonorable discharge. Forget your benefits, forget your pay, you won't get that either. He leaked about 750,000 classified documents to that anti-secrecy group, WikiLeaks. He will get some credit for the roughly three and a half years he's already served. He's going to be required to serve one-third of the sentence before he becomes eligible for parole. So lest you think that 90 years means 90 years, and 35 years means 35 years, no. In the military system, where he was prosecuted, it's almost the same as some state-run kinds of courts. Then there are the hearings. Good behavior, et cetera. He's 25 years old.

FATHER MICHAEL PFLEGER: Now, I've never said this - Children can - been shot and killed before. There is no question about it, here and across America, but when you target a child and shoot and kill him is a different thing. On the street there was a code, you didn't touch children, somebody's mother and somebody's grandmother. SPIKE LEE, DIRECTOR: Elders, too. PFLEGER: And elders.

This guy is going to get a big sentence anyway. But, either way, the prosecutor has all the cards at this point, except a body. CHUNG: Pat, one last question for you. The women who testified, did all of them testify? LALAMA: Well, yes. And the thing is that you have to remember about these women -- and I'm sure Jeffrey could speak to this more eloquently -- but there's a blur when you're talking about consent. People like to say they were bar girls and he met them on the beach and they had these histories. And the fact is that maybe some juries do or can't let go of any moral judgments or prejudgments they have about this. But the fact is that, if they were unaware and if they were surreptitiously fed any kind of drug, that's when the consent ends. And so I think that's what the jury was trying to say. And I think it's probably been painful for these three women, no matter what their -- quote -- ""histories"" were. CHUNG: All right.

This fighting, though, isn't taking place in an American-controlled sector but in Diwaniya, where some 1,300 Spanish troops are based. Further south in Basra, where mainly British troops operate, the situation also is deteriorating rapidly. Britain is the only U.S. ally with more than 10,000 troops in Iraq. Italy, Poland, Ukraine and Spain each have between 1,000 and 3,000 soldiers in country, though Spain has pledged to withdraw its troops by the end of June. The Shiite uprising now materializing was long anticipated by Iraqi analysts. And the major U.S. allies stationed in the Shiite dominated south are bearing the brunt. PROF. MICHAEL CLARKE, KINGS COLLEGE LONDON: I think the British realize that this is probably the most critical week since the end of the war itself, because there now seems to be a real possibility of a Shi'a dominated civil war across Iraq. And if that is the case, the previous security equation simply won't balance and more forces will have to be put in, greater tactics will have to be thought through and the whole political strategy will have to be re-addressed. And we may be facing those sort of issues really by the end of this week. RAZ: At the end of next week, British Prime Minister Tony Blair can raise those issues with President Bush in Washington. Tuesday, Blair met in London with Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari and said despite the new violence, there's no need to reassess the security strategy just yet. TONY BLAIR, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: And our response to this should not be to run away in fright or hide away or think that we've got it all wrong. Our response, on the contrary, should be to hold firm. RAZ: But with instability rising to dangerous levels across southern Iraq, other U.S. allies, like Italy, may begin to rethink their role in Iraq after the coalition hands over sovereignty to Iraqis on June 30. STEFANO SILVESTRI, INTL. AFFAIRS INSTITUTE: Are we changing the entire structure of the commands or are those remaining? The thing is not clear. So I suppose that it is part of the reassessment that will have to be made after June 30, hopefully a little before.

The controversy surrounding his son has really overshadowed this White House and really consumed the White House, overshadowing the president's agenda ahead of his next foreign trip. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP JR.: In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently. For me this was opposition research. CARROLL (voice-over): Donald Trump Jr. confronting the ever-worsening controversy that has his father's administration in full crisis mode. Multiple outlets describing the president's growing exasperation with the Russian revelations; and suspicion and finger-pointing between his closest West Wing advisors. The behind-the-scenes turmoil described to ""The Washington Post"" as a Category 5 hurricane, a characterization the president's lawyer refused. JAY SEKULOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: This is a Category Zero. This idea that this has consumed the White House is false. JOHNS: The White House on the defensive after Trump Jr. released a series of bombshell e-mails he had in June of last year with music publicist Rob Goldstone about setting up a meeting with a Russian government attorney. Goldstone saying he had a lead on dirt that would incriminate Hillary Clinton noting, ""This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information. But it's part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump."" Trump Jr. replying, ""If it is what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer."" TRUMP JR.: Someone sent me an e-mail. I can't help what someone sends me. This is 13 months ago before I think the rest of the world was talking about that, trying to build up this narrative about Russia, so I don't even think my sirens, you know, went up or the antennas went up. CARROLL: The president's son and his attorney insisting President Trump was not aware of the meeting or the e-mails. TRUMP JR.: It was such a nothing, there was nothing to tell. I wouldn't have even remembered it until you start scouring through the stuff. SEKULOW: The president, by the way, never saw the e-mail, didn't see the e-mail until it was seen today. CARROLL: CNN has learned the e-mails were discovered as Jared Kushner and his legal team were preparing for his upcoming congressional testimony. President Trump has been unusually reserved after months of insisting that the Russia investigations are fake news and a witch hunt. But the president did come to his son's defense Tuesday night, tweeting that ""He's a great person who loves our country,"" hours after the White House deputy press secretary read a statement on the president's behalf. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: ""My son is a high-quality person, and I applaud his transparency."" CARROLL: Vice President Mike Pence distancing himself from the growing controversy releasing a statement, stressing that the Russia meeting occurred before he joined the Trump ticket.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We're going to give them a one-year warning, and if the drugs don't stop or largely stopped, we're going to put tariffs on Mexico and if that doesn't stop the drugs, we close the border. I don't think we'll have to close the border because the penalty of tariffs on cars coming into the United States from Mexico at 25 percent, it will be massive. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOWELL: Let's talk about it now with James Davis. James is the dean of the School of Economics and Political Science at the University of St. Gallen, joining this hour from Munich, Germany. James, good to have you. JAMES DAVIS, DEAN, UNIVERSITY OF ST. GALLEN: Good morning, George. HOWELL: Let's start with what the president has called a crisis consistently. He has threatened to close the southern border with Mexico. And now he's backing down from that threat saying that he will give Mexico one year to curb the flow of people crossing the border. What do you make of this about-face? Mr. Trump says, you know, tariffs could be on the way, focusing on cars, giving them a year, what do you make of it? DAVIS: Well it's not a consistent story coming out of the White House, that's the first point. The president was speaking about crisis of illegal immigration into the United States, he was claiming that thousands and thousands of people were streaming across the border. Caravans were coming from Central America and this had to stop. Now he's talking about drugs, and the crisis of drugs in the United States. So he's sort of shifting the focus of their discussion away from immigration toward the drug problems, all the while, of course, moving back with backtracking on his threat to close the border. Why? Because the Republicans and the Congress and the American business community warned him that if he did that it would be -- have catastrophic consequences on American business. It would also lead to empty shelves in American markets that are relying on produce from South and Central America to keep people fed. So, this was an ill- thought through policy from the beginning. And the president has retreated, but he's been retreating on a number of issues. HOWELL: All right. There's also the frustration that has reportedly been building among investigators in the special counsel's office. The attorney general's four-page assessment of their 400 page -- pages of work. They say that it goes too far in clearing the president. At one point",0.0896241912142036,2019-04-05

Without Edie Falco in the drama race, that award could go to Kyra Sedgwick for the TNT series, ""The Closer."" MURPHY: This is the role of a lifetime from Kyra Sedgwick.

142794,251127,CNN,CNN Late Edition,"It takes too long to hire people and too long to fire bad employees. Appeals go on forever and ever and ever, and the Democrats wanted to preserve that same system. The Democrats actually wanted also to diminish the president's national security authority, an important area, that presidents have had since the time of President Kennedy. We really couldn't figure out what the wisdom of that, either substantively or politically, was, and I don't think the American people saw the wisdom in taking that position either. So surely now we can come back. I don't think that the president's ever been in a position that he would never move off of that. In fact, he's made several moves already. But there's some people... BLITZER: So you see some common ground? THOMPSON: There's always -- it's so complex and there's so many moving parts to it. There's always room to talk about those things. In fact, we have some people working this weekend and looking at some of those things where we could, perhaps, come together on. And I would not be at all surprised -- the president is really pushing strong for us, in this lame-duck session, to get this done, and I think we need to get it done. And I think we can. BLITZER: How long will it take? THOMPSON: I don't know. I think if we could come together -- and we came very close at one time, and Democrats, Republicans were sitting together, a few of us in a room, and really getting what I felt like was close and real progress. And they told us later, the Democratic leadership had pulled them back, the Democrats back from the negotiating table. I think they thought it would be to their benefit to do that at the time. But that's all over now. It's ancient history. And surely we can come together in these waning days to do something that we should have done months ago. BLITZER: So you're saying there's a good chance there will be a deal in the coming days? THOMPSON: I hope so. I think that we're going to make a real try at it, and I don't know if the Democrats will filibuster the bill or not. I hope not. BLITZER: Are you going to filibuster? LEVIN: No, the filibuster -- what happened here is that we were willing to have two votes and apparently Senator Gramm of Texas, the Republican, was not willing to go along with that. BLITZER: So what does that mean? LEVIN: We were not the ones -- we were not the ones filibustering, in other words. We were willing to have these two options put to a vote. That there was a Republican senator who was not willing to have that come to a conclusion. So I don't know that it's fair to talk about the Democrats as being unwilling to bring this to a vote.

925583,1209440,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"Saudi Arabia cut its production, right? SPITZER: What they do -- oil -- Saudi Arabia cut its production because they said the market was in equilibrium. They said, if anything, there was oversupply. But speculators -- being a speculator is not illegal. There are people who bid on what they think the future price of oil is going to be. Unless there is collusion, unless there is some illegal way that they are trading, then they are just playing the casino that we call the stock market, and the options market and the futures market and commodities. That is not illegal. And they are merely betting on the psychology of the oil markets. Remember, people bet in the options market for commodities based on what they think the future price will be, because of what's going on in the Middle East, because the Chinese are driving enormous demand, because OPEC can always control the supply, they are making all these bets about what they think the future will be and they're driving the price up. We need an energy policy here in this nation. Yes, I'm sure there's some illegality out there in the market. Some people are gaming the system. They should be sent to jail. But that's not why oil is going up right now. COSTELLO: OK. So, why do you think Americans believe that? Because when you talk to typical Americans out there, they always say it's the oil speculators. The president specifically brought that up in his speech. And then the Justice Department comes through with this task force. Then why is it all of that happening? SPITZER: Well, two observations. First, all these prosecutors should have been doing this already. They don't need to create a task force. If there is illegality in these markets, where was the SEC, where was the CFTC, where was the attorney general? The attorney general hasn't made a significant case after years of the biggest economic cataclysm in history. So, this is a cheap press release. Let's be honest about it. This is not something that's going to address the issue. We have not had an energy policy. We all remember -- you are too young. But I remember Jimmy Carter's speech 30-plus years ago, he's there sitting with cardigan sweater saying we need an energy policy. We still haven't done anything. And so, let's not go to the cheap political answer, put a press release, create a task force -- that's not going to do it. This is politics. Look, I was in politics. I know when there's a real answer. I was a prosecutor. Yes, you want to make these cases. We should have made the cases on Wall Street years ago, that could have saved us from the economic cataclysm. The oil markets right now were driven by OPEC. They are being driven by Chinese demand.

CNN's Satinder Bindra joins us by videophone from the headquarters for the exercises -- Satinder. SATINDER BINDRA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Donna, in just about a half- hour, some 50,000 troops will participate in a mock battle, and this is the first time that India is conducting such an exercise in a setting in which chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons can be used. Of course, India most fears a first nuclear strike from just across the border with Pakistan. That is perhaps why that India is holding its exercise here, just 90 kilometers from the border with Pakistan. India has also named this exercise ""Complete Victory."" In 1987, Donna, India held a similar large exercise here. Pakistan then grew very concerned. It thought the exercise perhaps was a ruse for an invasion, and both sides came pretty close to war. This time, those fears are not so heightened, but clearly concern on the other side of the border, from Pakistan. Pakistan saying that India did not inform it of this exercise well on time.

What makes this lab so special? YATES: What makes this lab so special, I think, is the effort we put into increasing what we call the sensitivity of the DNA technology. CHANG: Here scientists can develop a comprehensive DNA profile from a single cell. ANGHARAD DURKIN, DNA EXPERT: If it's a full profile, that would be a one in a billion. So that's one person within a billion would have that profile. CHANG: This past summer, Portuguese police came here hoping to advance their investigation into the May disappearance of the three- year-old English girl Madeleine McCann. DNA evidence could be the only hope in solving this mystery. YATES: We're equally there to exonerate the innocent, as we are to convict or to assist in the conviction of the guilty.

KINZINGER: I hope so. I think it's going to be something that probably ultimately comes out of the Senate. And I have to -- look, I have to be fair in hitting my Democratic colleagues too. To say that the starting position is absolutely, we will never do anything that has to do with a wall, the President has never said that, unlike DACA, for instance, and Dreamers. So I think there's an opportunity, if we all can say -- you know, both sides can declare victory. It doesn't matter. But if we can say some money here, let's fix the DACA situation, which we all want to do, Americans would actually look out here and go, OK, well, that was a stupid 30-day shutdown, but at least we got something good out of it. CUOMO: All right, Congressman, thank you so much for joining us tonight. And thank you for your service to the country. KINZINGER: You bet. Take care. CUOMO: And credits where it's due. I mean it's good to have a Republican congressman or any congressman saying, hey, let's vote and be a little disappointed and let's figure something out. Fine. But facts first. Democrats have a little bit of a mixed message here, but here's what we understand. They have offered money and a lot more than $1 for border security. Right now the number's at about $1.3 billion, including more bollard fencing, which is what we call the wall. Now, it's just a fraction of the $5 billion that the President is asking for, but it's not nothing. Now, part of this is on the Dems, not because they did the shutdown. This was the President's doing he told you all on national television. But they do keep saying they don't want to fund the wall. In fact, you heard Senator Schumer say exactly that, it will never pass in the Senate. He'll never get the money for his wall. They're talking about the amount, not the wall at all. It is a messy answer, fair point, and it's a messy situation. The end the shutdown movement should be the reality for everybody.

A number of homes, most likely, will have to simply be bulldozed and this area rebuilt -- Erin. BURNETT: Deb, let me ask you a question. You were showing a family you had a chance to speak with. But with the 80 homes that were burned, where are the other people who own those homes? I know some of them were second homes. Are all of the people accounted for tonight? FEYERICK: OK, I lost it -- BURNETT: OK, obviously, as you heard Deb saying, they had trouble with communications, only having one cell phone. So she obviously didn't hear me. If we get an answer to that though, of course, I'll share it with you later on in the hour. There are more than 100 people tonight trapped on another island called Fire Island. It's a narrow barrier island off of Long Island. And right now rescuers can't even reach residents who are stuck, because all of the marinas on the islands have been completely destroyed. Earlier I spoke to Karen Boss. She is stranded on the island and I asked her what the situation was like on the island outside her home right now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAREN BOSS, STRANDED ON FIRE ISLAND, NEW YORK (via telephone): At this point right now, the bay side is subsiding, the water is going down. And the ocean also has backed down. I have no power. I have a generator in my home. There is no electric in my community. There is no water in my community. BURNETT: And how much food and water do you have? I mean, I know that especially when you look at the electricity situation or how long it could take for help to come, I mean, how long could you be there? BOSS: I have a generator, so my refrigerator is -- well, I'm a year-round resident. So I'm always stocked up. I don't know when help will get here. The main concern is obviously to get water and electricity. There are a lot of downed power lines, a lot of debris. There is a lot of downed trees, a lot of devastation on the ocean homes and on the boardwalk. BURNETT: Have you been given any indication of when you could be rescued at this point, or literally it's just -- it's still silent?

But I do think that in the case of Rand Paul, I applaud him consistently for what he and his dad had both said, although there were reports, he told the group of evangelical ministers he doesn`t support full decriminalization. KORNACKI: No, he says he does ... FUGELSANG: Interesting question for him on the campaign trail in 2016. KORNACKI: Right. WINSTEAD: Well, and I think you have to consistently - you know, decriminalization seems to be the way to go, because why should your criminal record be tainted because you smoked pot in an area code versus another area code. FUGELSANG: That language is the way to go. I mean stop saying legalization. When you say decriminalization, you`re saying let`s stop locking people up for something that was a consensual ... KORNACKI: Right. And 17 - 17 states have that, what it actually means practically in most of these states, I mean Alaska, there is no fine right now for it. In other states, though, it means it is a civil penalty, you`re fined 500 bucks, you`re fined a thousand bucks, you get a ticket, something like that. I think 17 states have gone in that direction. We have the news this morning, the big news this morning is here in the state of New York, Andrew Cuomo moving now towards medical marijuana, but it looks like the proposal, it is a very sort of conservative version. ST. PIERRE: I would suggest this is the political blowback from the West Coast. Here on the East Coast, all of the medical marijuana programs are very limited in scope, like New Jersey only allows five retail outlets and Connecticut, they`re going only sell it through pharmacies. And here the governor is talking about 20 hospitals. So, it is a honing of the program, but an acknowledgment that marijuana is medicine. REYNOLDS: It is a gateway law to much bigger ... (LAUGHTER) KORNACKI: That`s what I kind of wonder about Jeff, you know. We can think back to the late `90s, when we started seeing the idea of medical marijuana take off. I think California might have been first. ST. PIERRE: `96. KORNACKI: It was `96 in California. So, here we are, 18 years later. And you look at the momentum on this issue. How it has kind of grown. It`s not just medical now. Now, it`s states saying you can sell this recreationally. Is this -- do you -- I know you don`t want to see it legalized, but do you see long-term momentum on this that makes it inevitable that we`re going to get there, and this is a 50-state thing? REYNOLDS: Yeah, look, I think there has been a significant change. I think the issues around medical marijuana are somewhat different because it is my belief that this emphasis on smoked pot is medicine, has stymied our research around pharmaceutical",0.3662498991099664,2014-01-05

COOPER: And, Rick, what does it tell you that President Trump and his allies started pointing to this in Pennsylvania with an assist from the Justice Department as evidence of voter fraud is real, and by extension, that the legitimacy of the entire election is somehow at risk? RICHARD L. HASEN, CNN ELECTION LAW ANALYST: I think we're just at the beginning of this, what we're seeing is taking minor administrative errors. This turns out to have been a contract employee who was third day on the job, made a screw up, and all of a sudden the President who was tipped off by Barr apparently before the public even knew about this investigation, claiming that it shows widespread voter fraud. I think we're going to be hearing this constantly. The idea is going to be that the election is rigged and we're going to keep hearing this unless Trump actually wins the election. And it might be a basis for Trump to say he didn't really lose the election, or it might be a basis to try to have a post-election litigation to try to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. COOPER: Yes. I mean, David, what's so ridiculous about them pointing to this incident is this mistake that was made with seven ballots. And the way they went about it is, if that's the best evidence that they can point to, I mean, again, that argues against their very case. I mean, if they had reams of evidence of widespread organized voter fraud, they would certainly use it. They formed a commission on it because President Trump has been claiming voter fraud for years and they don't find it because it's not there. As someone who worked in the Department of Justice, David, for both Democratic and Republican administrations does what we're seeing from Barr and his relationship with the President, particularly with matters of executive power, rule of law and mail-in voting, I mean, it doesn't -- does it square with your understanding of how things are supposed to work? LAUFMAN: No, it's directly counter to them. In every administration, there is a memo that the Attorney General abides by that sets out the terms in which the White House and the Department of Justice can communicate on pending criminal investigations. What happened yesterday, is directly counter to that. This wasn't just a question of coordination between the White House and the Department of Justice. I dare say this is outright collusion between the White House and the Department of Justice and the rollout -- the public rollout of comments about a pending investigation, expressly intended to benefit the President politically. COOPER: Rick, does -- you know, we had Tom Friedman on the program last night who, you know, was legitimately worried about, you know, civil insurrection. The President encouraging violence if he doesn't get his way on the election, are you worried about",0.0763501678587067,2020-09-25

It's especially a loud voice now, because as you pointed out in the introduction, the message from Capitol Hill takes on partisan tones whenever it's made in the Republicans. It really, unfortunately, taken an odd turn in condemning the violence. BROWN: And this is coming from a Republican election lawyer. We talked about the strong language that these judges are using. Do you think it is more about lecturing the defendants or teaching the public, sending a strong message to the public amid what we're hearing from some of these Republican lawmakers? GINSBERG: The judiciary is the chief exemplar of our institutions and really are norms. And I think these judges, there's a reason judges are appointed for life, which is in a situation like this. They can step back from the political heat and talk about the values of the Constitution, the values of the country itself and I think that's what judges of both parties are doing, appointed by presidents of both parties. And they're really taking a step back from the politics of the day and talking about the basic principles of the country. BROWN: Is there another time in history where we have seen the judiciary play such a big role in protecting democracy? GINSBERG: It's a great question. There have been certainly times of great stress on our institutions in the past. Watergate was certainly one, the Vietnam War and there are instances, the race riots in the early '60s. This is a time where the legal process is really front and center ahead of the political process in having to basically sort of write the situation and reaffirm the values. BROWN: What do you think would have happened after the election if these judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents, if they weren't upholding their oath? GINSBERG: Well, I think that would have put the country in an even more tenuous position. So thank goodness that these judges did that. I mean, not only in dealing with the insurrectionists, but also in the flood of post election cases, the contest, the recounts, the litigation. Judges really did stick by the rule of law in that situation. And today, you see instances of courts holding some of the lawyers who made the most irresponsible charges accountable. The Colorado sanctions that you mentioned, Rudy Giuliani has had his bar license suspended by the State of New York, Sidney Powell went through a really difficult hearing up in Michigan where a federal judge is considering sanction motions as well. All those cases and there are others pending send a message. BROWN: Yep, they send a message loud and clear. Ben Ginsberg, thank you so much for coming on. GINSBERG: Thanks, Pamela.

There is no evidence the tape exists and Trump has denied the alleged incident. All right, we'll go to London next where British Police continue to question a 25-year-old man they believe fatally stabbed a popular British lawmaker and church activist, Sir David Amess. New details straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WHITFIELD: To the U.K. now where fears are growing over the safety of British lawmakers after the fatal stabbing of David Amess. A suspect has been arrested and police are treating this as a terrorist incident. The fatal attack, the second in five years against a Member of Parliament has heightened security concerns for all lawmakers. CNN's Nada Bashir is covering these developments for us. Nada, what do we know about the suspect and the motivation here? NADA BASHIR, CNN PRODUCER: Fredricka, the investigation into this incident is still ongoing. Police, as you mentioned, have confirmed this as being treated as a terrorist incident. A 25-year-old British national believed to be of Somali heritage and identified by a Whitehall source as Ali Harbi Ali has been arrested on suspicion of murder. And according to the police early evidence, as part of this investigation suggests that the motivation for this attack may have been linked to extremist Islamist ideology. Now, we know that that individual has been arrested and police say that there is -- they don't think that another individual is connected to this incident. But there have been some real concerns as to how something like this could have happened. Now, Sir David Amess was killed, stabbed multiple times while carrying out a constituency surgery, that is a sort of open forum or open office hours, if you like with his local constituents, and he was stabbed multiple times at this very public setting. So, there are some serious concerns here. And we were at Leigh-on-Sea, just outside the church where he was attacked, and we spoke to local residents yesterday, and they told us that they were seriously shocked by the incident. Sir David Amess was a cornerstone of the community and many were coming to leave flowers and messages of condolences at the police cordon line. But in the last few hours, we have now heard from Sir David's family and I can read you a little bit of their emotional statement release today.

That put much of the focus during the last half of the week on racial issues instead of on health care. More bad news for the president has come from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO estimates the health care plan supported by the White House would save almost no money over 10 years. They're talking about an outside panel that would decide what treatments would be covered by Medicare. But the CBO did say the government's insurance plan could co-exist with private insurance companies without driving them out of business. And finally, most Americans aren't in that big a rush to get health care passed. Check out these Gallup poll numbers. Less than half of those surveyed -- 41 percent is all -- say that health care reform has to be passed this year. Thirty percent say it should not be done -- it should be done, rather -- but not necessarily this year. And 24 percent say there shouldn't be any health care reform at all. So here's the question: What can President Obama do to regain momentum on health care reform? Go to CNN.com/caffertyfile and post a comment on my blog. You know, I bet if you went back to that news conference Wednesday night he might not have take than last question. BLITZER: Or he might have just ended it without saying the police acted stupidly.

There is only one little problem with what you're saying about free markets. Free markets are assured by democracies. China happens to be a Communist nation. CNOOC, the Chinese natural overseas oil corporation is 70 percent owned by the government. How does that work out in your view? TAYLOR: I'm not sure what you mean. I'd say from an economic standpoint, I'd say from an economic standpoint, France's economy is more Communist than China's? It's a pretty free market economy. DOBBS: Excuse me? TAYLOR: Absolutely. DOBBS: OK. Let's try it another way. The fact that a U.S. company could not buy any asset, let alone a company within the Chinese energy sector, does have any influence on a libertarian philosophy? TAYLOR: Well, again, it's not a matter of whether it has an influence on a libertarian philosophy or not. You can look at the data, right now U.S. corporations own over $100 billion of assets in China and they employ 350,000 people. Chinese corporations own only $8 billion... DOBBS: Excuse me. What is the highest percentage of -- would he whoa, whoa. What is the highest percentage ownership of any Chinese enterprise by a U.S. corporation? TAYLOR: Chinese enterprises are very small. I'm not sure what the numbers are, but they're not particularly relevant. DOBBS: Well, they're very relevant. Because they're talking about buying 100 percent of a company that's prescribed altogether in their energy sector. TAYLOR: As Venezuelan bought Citco. The Venezuelan state oil company owns 28 percent of U.S. oil refineries. And yet, we haven't heard any bed wetting about that. I mean, this is not an unprecedented event in the slightest. There have been many events like this, many purchases by foreign-owned oil companies.

And that`s why you have to look at every possible location that child could be and follow through. GRACE: Well, you know, another issue with that -- to Dr. Bethany Marshall -- is that was outside of her normal route. That was outside her going back and forth to the boyfriend, back and forth to Blanchard Park. So to me that waved a red flag. BETHANY MARSHALL, PSYCHOANALYST, AUTHOR OF ""DEALBREAKERS"": I think so and when you observe this girl, Casey, she really engages in a very narrow range of behaviors. Even as a mother, I mean, I watched this video and she`s smiling at her daughter and she`s -- you know, she seems so enamored with the daughter and you really wonder if she sort of put on the mask of sanity. She`s acting like she cares about the daughter or gravitating towards the attention that the daughter gives her like she may have been gravitating toward Robert Dick`s attention and made up a big old story to make him happy. But that deep down she`s really a deadened individual who doesn`t have the capacity to attach. GRACE: Back to Robert Dick who was providing security for mom Casey Anthony. She told him this bizarre new story about leaving the little girl with Zenaida Gonzalez at a park and Gonzalez giving her an alleged script to read to police and others that question where Caylee was. What was her demeanor when she told you this story? ROBERT DICK, PROVIDED SECURITY FOR CASEY ANTHONY, SAYS TOT MOM TOLD HIM SHE LEFT CAYLEE AT PARK: Well, she has a very outgoing personality. It`s never down, always seems happy. And. GRACE: She was happy? DICK: It`s my belief she was giving leads, in her mind, at least, that would point me in a direction to confirm her story, though different still trying to give out the same Zenaida, the kidnapping, you know, in that direction. GRACE: You said she was upbeat? DICK: As far as just our normal contact it was just like any day with any other person. GRACE: So her demeanor was not upset about Caylee. She wasn`t talking about the search? What else did she talk about? DICK: To be honest, she just talks the whole time. I mean. GRACE: About what? DICK: . and it`s about anything. I mean the weather, the way some place used to be and now let`s -- you know, different stories there. I mean just about anything. GRACE: What did she say about Caylee? DICK: Caylee didn`t come up a lot in discussion. Now understand that I`m not allowed to ask her any questions. I`m just there. I -- it`s part of an agreement, I couldn`t question her. GRACE: Right.

The rabbi says that proved crucial when he was able to ultimately throw a chair toward the suspect to help them safely escape. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHEN (voice-over): The FBI has identified 44-year-old British national Malik Faisal Akram as the man who held four people hostage at a Texas synagogue on Saturday. The nearly 11-hour standoff ended after an FBI hostage team shot and killed Akram. All four hostages are safe and unharmed. The situation began during the synagogue's livestream of its Saturday morning sabbath. In the feed, you can hear Akram speaking. It's unclear whom he is speaking to, but Akram can be heard saying he plans to die. MALIK FAISAL AKRAM, SUSPECT: I have got these four guys with me, yeah? So, I don't want to hurt them, yeah? OK, are you listening? I don't want you to cry. Listen, I'm going to release these four guys. But then I'm going to go in the yard, yes? And they're going to take me, all right? Are you listening? I am going to die, OK? So, don't cry over me. CHEN: In a statement to CNN, one of the hostages, Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, said: ""In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening."" He credited the security training his congregation had taken part in, in getting them through the traumatic event. JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO AND NATIONAL DIRECTOR, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: This is the first time that anyone at ADL can recall a hostage-taking at a synagogue. But, unfortunately, Jewish sites have been targeted again and again and again by extremists over the years. CHEN: According to officials, Akram entered the United States legally in December. He was vetted and cleared prior to his arrival at JFK Airport in New York five weeks ago. Federal authorities do not believe that this was part of a greater plot, but they are questioning how Akram was able to travel to Texas. According to law enforcement, British intelligence officials tell their U.S. counterparts a preliminary search showed no derogatory information on Akram. Once Akram arrived in Dallas, he spent several nights at a local homeless shelter. The Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler told CNN in a phone call that: ""We were a way station for him. He had a plan. He was very quiet. He was in and out."" Now the FBI is conducting a global investigation to try to determine a motive. MATT DESARNO, FBI DALLAS SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE: I'm not ready to add any more about the demands, except they were specifically focused one issue. CHEN: According to two law enforcement sources, one possible motive was the desire to free Aafia Siddiqui. Siddiqui is serving an 86-year sentence in federal prison in Texas for the attempted murder and armed attack of U.S. service members.

BOB FISCELLA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kyra, I am a golf fanatic and I would not want to be playing on this golf course this week. They have really made this golf course tough. And I'm sure I'd spend half of my day looking for golf balls. The rough is thick. But these guys have managed to master the conditions.

He's won six of the last 10 major championships, and he takes a commander four-stroke lead into the final round of this U.S. Open Championship. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TIGER WOODS, PRO.

You could agree on nine things, disagree on one, and but one thing, of course, made the headlines, because so much of the modern media is an effort to stimulate controversy, sensationalism, because basically, that's what's news as opposed to things on which people agree. So, in the specific case of Northern Ireland, as I said, I think it made it very difficult in some circumstances. But I think you can't have a functioning democracy without a free and vigorous press. CLANCY: Dennis Ross, the media on one hand. Well, they may have helped in some areas, but they had to drive you nuts in the other. They second-guessed you. They criticized you. They accused you of bias. They made it more difficult, didn't they? ROSS: Well, I'll tell you, from that standpoint, they certainly didn't make my life easy. And they didn't make the, in a sense, the process of negotiations easy, because there was also a constant effort to unveil what was particularly sensitive, and would expose one side or the other before they were ready to take certain actions. Having said that, I have to tell you something. In retrospect, I think one of the mistakes that I made was being too protective of the leaders and the negotiators. I was always protecting them in the public domain. But I think, if I had to do it over again, one of the things I would do differently is to make it clear, while I would not ever betray a confidence, because you couldn't continue to fulfill a role, I would have made it clear that they had to begin to condition their publics on what it was going to take to be able to make peace, what kinds of compromises would be necessary. Absent that recognition, absent that readiness to prepare their publics, the fact of the matter is, it became much harder to ever cross the threshold and make the kinds of decisions necessary. Maybe, if I had done that, maybe in a sense had I used the media more to create that kind of pressure, things might have been different.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Swing forward. That a boy, land in the blue. Perfect! ROMANS: Everyone agrees kids need to be more active. It's the how that's the question. There's organic play, and then there's specialized sports. Where do you cross the line? CARDONE: Unstructured activity is probably -- will lead to less of these overuse type injuries that we see. It's not until you introduce a parent or a coach into the activity that it leads to these overuse type injuries. ROMANS: It's one thing to encourage babies to stretch and roll, say psychologists like Wendy Walsh, but toddler sports training is extreme parenting, she says, especially for kids who may not be ready. WENDY WALSH, BLOGGER, MOUNTLOGIC.COM: You want to be a good parent? Go to the playground. Climb the monkey bars with your kids. You can get in shape with them. I used to do pull-ups on the bars and sit-ups in the sand box, OK? That's what kids need.

BOLHUIS: I understand that there are skeptics and there are concerns, and every good thing can be done in a harmful way.

This is something that everyone we talked to for this piece, they all agree on that, that each kid is different and has their own timetable for learning and for growing and for learning these skills.

1549542,1864550,CNN,The Situation Room,"these bomb-making skills now more readily available to these young ISIS recruits? But here's what we know about Najim Laachraoui. He was 24 years old. He was born in Morocco. He is known to have traveled to Syria, Wolf, in 2013, meaning that he was definitely on the radar of authorities. There was an Interpol red alert out for him. In that red alert, it details he was believed to have involvement with terrorist organizations, that he was believed to have expertise in terms of dealing with explosives. And we know that he was very closely involved with the Paris attacks because his DNA was found at the scene of one of these bomb-making factories. In addition to that, we know that he was wiring money at a Western Union to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who was the ringleader of the Paris attacks. There will definitely be a sense of relief here in Belgium knowing that he is dead, that he is now confirmed to be the other suicide attacker in those airport bombings. But certainly there are a lot of questions as well as to how he was able to elude capture for so long when authorities were -- when he was so well known to authorities -- Wolf. BLITZER: It's very disturbing. I have got to tell you. Clarissa, what else are you learning about the man on the run seen in the light colored jacket in that airport surveillance image? The one with the hat on? What are you hearing about him? WARD: Well, Wolf, authorities are being extremely tight-lipped at the moment. That's been a common theme in the last few days. I think there's a sense here that they don't want the media to get wind on any of their leads because they don't want it to spread and potentially contaminate one of the sites or tip off one of the terrorists. What we do know is that he is the primary focus of this manhunt. You have seen this image now so many times. Of course, he looks very distinctive next to the two men in black. He's wearing a lighter jacket. He's wearing glasses and a cap, potentially possibly an attempt to disguise his face. Perhaps what's most noticeable is that unlike the other two men, who are both wearing one glove each, those gloves likely used to conceal a detonator, he is not wearing any gloves. That could be a sign that he was never intended to act as a suicide bomber. We know that in his suitcase there was the largest amount of most powerful explosives. But what we don't know yet is, did he get cold feet? Did the bomb just not detonate, and perhaps most importantly, Wolf, where is he now? We heard Belgium's prosecutor earlier on saying there is still a number of wanted people potentially armed and dangerous at large. This is very much still an unfolding and ongoing situation, Wolf.

He said that we have to have a foreign policy that engages the world. We need to lead from the front. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: Senator Marco Rubio was also concerned. He posted a statement on FaceBook. ""Giving the uncertainty that exists both at home and abroad about the direction of our foreign policy, it would be against our national interest to have this confirmation unnecessarily delayed or embroiled in controversy. Therefore, despite my reservations, I will support Mr. Tillerson's nomination in committee and in the full Senate."" He's going to be confirmed, right? MERKLEY: Yes. Yes. And the fact that all three of these individuals had substantial concerns tells you a lot. Lindsey Graham and John McCain have been very tough on Russia. They've been very tough on Iran. They've been involved in the sanctions on both ends. And the fact that Tillerson comes from a direction where they were involved on the opposite side of that argument as a company and really didn't make an explanation of that in committee, that's why these individuals are so concerned. They'd much prefer to have someone else, but in the end they're not going - as a Republican, they're not going to tell the president to withdraw his nomination. BLITZER: And so they have 52 Republicans in the Senate, 48 Democrats. They have the votes. Although maybe some of the Democrats will still vote with the Republicans on this one as well. MERKLEY: It's quite possible. BLITZER: We'll see. So he's going to be confirmed. Let's talk a little bit about the president's decision, this executive order today, to withdraw from negotiations for the TPP, the Trans- Pacific Partnership. What's your reaction on that? MERKLEY: It's way past time to drive a stake through the heart of the TPP. So I applaud him on that. But everything else he's doing is not for working people. And I think that the fact that his very first executive action was to put a $500 per year fee on average Americans to buy a home and doing it at Wall Street's request because they didn't want the competition with the organization and so then you have - BLITZER: So you like his decision to do - to get rid of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. What about his decision today to renegotiate NAFTA, the North America Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Are you with him on that?

ADVISER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: What happened, Wolf, there were four strong bids. There was an awful lot of intensive lobbying in the room. There were many relationships playing out there, and it didn't work out the way we would have wanted. Chicago made a great effort, and the president was proud to have been a part of that effort on behalf of the city and on behalf of the country. And they decided to go another way. BLITZER: Was it a mistake to send the president over there? AXELROD: Look, Wolf, had he not gone, he would have been criticized for not going. Some will criticize him for going. I think the important thing is that the president will go anywhere to promote the interests of this country, to try and bring something of this magnitude to this country. And I think it was time well worth spending. He left at 7:00 last night. He'll be back this afternoon. All he gave up really was a little bit of sleep, and it was -- it was worth the effort. He'd do it again. BLITZER: Some will say, and you know this because you're a good political analyst, that this was a personal slap at the president of the United States by the International Olympic Committee. What do you say to that? AXELROD: Well, look, I think this is a town where every day is Election Day and everybody is keeping score. I think in the big scheme of things, it makes very little difference. I don't think this was a repudiation of the president. I think it was a reflection of some of the other relationships that came into play here.

SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: I, for one, don't know whether or not to trust the intelligence estimates on North Korea now. ENSOR: Director Tenet says U.S. intelligence officials is accustomed to the political pressure. But They have worried for months now that as the criticism grow, staff level CIA analysts may find it harder to tell it like it is, and politics be damned. STUART COHEN, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE COUNCIL: I'm afraid. I worry constantly about their willingness to make the hard calls when we're being second- guessed. ENSOR: Some former intelligence officials worry that if the White House picks the panel and designs its mandate, the issue of whether the administration may have attempted to influence intelligence analysts and their product might not be addressed. KEN POLLACK, CNN ANALYST: It was a relentless series of questions. Any time they wrote something that did not seem to accord with what some members of the administration wanted to hear, they were subjected to a barrage of questions. ENSOR: Pollack stresses, however, that he does not know of any intelligence analyst who wrote anything that he or she did not believe to be true.

But with the establishment of this New blue ribbon commission, is that more likely now? ENSOR: I wouldn't say so. And actually, there have only been a couple of people who have called for his resignation. He has been CIA director, director of Central Intelligence, for a long time now, under two presidents. He was originally appointed by Bill Clinton. George Bush is the one who gets to decide how much longer he serves. And George Bush seems to trust and like him.

Oklahoma City has just seen a quarter inch since the end of October and in that time, fired scorched more than 300,000 acres statewide, destroyed more than 220 homes and businesses. Joining me now from Oklahoma City is the governor, Brad Henry. Governor, appreciate you being with us. I'm sorry it is under these conditions. Have you ever seen anything this bad in your state? GOV. BRAD HENRY, OKLAHOMA: Well, I don't think so. You know, we have had a number of bad fire years. This it is worst anyone can remember. COOPER: You toured a fire damaged areas in Oklahoma city. How are people doing? What did you see today? HENRY: Well, today we toured a number of damaged areas here in Oklahoma City. Saturday we had tours over the rest of the areas of the state that have been scorched by fires. You can see some of the damage here behind me. We consoled a number of family members and generally consulted with them and tried to help them get the assistance they need. You know, our hearts go out to all of the Oklahomans impacted by the fires and Anderson, I want to say our hearts go out to those that are trapped in the mine in West Virginia and their families, as well as the Californians who are enduring the floods. COOPER: It seems like nature's conspiring against a lot of people tonight. How many fires -- I mean, do you know how many fires are currently going right now in Oklahoma? HENRY: Currently, we have somewhere in the neighborhood of about 30 fires. New ones seem to pop up all the time. We had just in Oklahoma county, one county, surrounding the largest metropolitan area yesterday, 35 fires reported. It's pretty bad. We have over 360,000 acres scorched by fires. Lost about 220 homes. Fortunately, we have only had a couple of fatalities since the fires really began in mid-November. The amazing thing to me is firefighters have done just a fabulous job. You know, as you do a tour and you see just literally thousands and thousands of scorched areas, home after home after home that was spared fire damage. The fires burned up to the porches and the firefighters were able to protect the homes. So although we have lost a scant number of homes firefighters have done a great job and save add lot, too. We appreciate the job they've done. COOPER: They're working no doubt around the clock for days now. They have to be exhausted and I guess no end in sight. HENRY: Especially in the rural areas where we have smaller fire departments and volunteer fire departments. They don't have big shifts or big crews where they can change shifts so it's been very taxing.

Now, a vast majority of Americans want to live in a racially-diverse neighborhood. That is a steep change, just in my lifetime. Again, not mission accomplished, but can we just acknowledge how far we've come and where we are right now? CUOMO: And the pushback becomes, well, it's just the truth. We're just telling the truth, is that racism continues, it's systemic, it's -- (CROSSTALK) CUOMO: -- everything around us. But you have to be taught where it is everywhere because that's how we remedy it. And otherwise, you're just hiding from the truth. MAHER: That's nuts. It's just -- it's just silly. It's just virtually signaling (ph) -- CUOMO: Now -- MAHER: I mean -- CUOMO: -- here is the problem. You say that all the time. Why aren't you concerned that whether it's HBO or whoever owns them in that minute or your audience or some group comes and says, ""Maher said too much. He's got to go."" Why aren't you afraid of that? MAHER: They do it every week. When -- I mean, I tape the show Friday. It goes on -- CUOMO: That's called Tuesday. MAHER: Yes. Exactly. At Friday night. And Saturday, some people who haven't seen the show yet say to me, ""how did the show go?"" And I always say, if I haven't been cancelled today, it went fantastic. That it was a giant success. CUOMO: But you don't change. MAHER: No. They come after me every week for something. I mean, both sides, which I think is great. CUOMO: Maybe that's what saves you. MAHER: I -- CUOMO: That you have both sides coming after you. MAHER: And that's fairly new because -- not because I changed. My politics have not changed. I'm an old-school liberal. It's -- when we were talking about the race issue, they changed. Not me. I was -- I was the old -- we are -- should be moving toward a colorblind society where we don't see race. That's the old way to look at it. I think that's still the good way to look at it. That's how we win, when it doesn't matter what your race is. The quality of your character, not the color of your skin. That's not wokeism? Wokeism, we have to see it everywhere all the time. That's different. I don't know if that makes it better. But I am, for the first time, when I'm on the road now, playing to very often a politically-mixed audience. That never happened, ever. And I don't think it happens really hardly anywhere else in America. CUOMO: Why? Do you think there's an increasing separation -- MAHER: I think -- CUOMO: -- between real people and the people who are in power over them?

198706,347711,CNN,American Morning,"HEIDI COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: In our ""House Call"" this morning: new findings from scientists who are working out treatment options for children with attention deficit disorder. Medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen is with us now from CNN Center to tell us more about this. Something that a lot of parents talk about. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Oh, absolutely, Heidi. More children get diagnosed with ADD or ADHD than any other psychiatric disorder. And some experts are fearing that Ritalin has become a one-size-fits-all prescription, when, for some of these kids, Ritalin can be a disaster. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) COHEN (voice-over): Tyler and his parents know all about Ritalin. CHRIS SCHWARTZ, FATHER: When he was on the drug, he would be very sedated, almost, to somewhat zombie-like. GAIL SCHWARTZ, MOTHER: He was almost becoming emaciated. He was becoming so thin. There was a period of time where he couldn't stop chewing on his tongue. And I was laying down with him one night when he was trying to go to sleep. And he just started crying. He was so frustrated that he could not stop chewing his tongue. COHEN: To figure out why Ritalin and other stimulants weren't working for Tyler, his doctor, Daniel Amen, decided to scan Tyler's brain. Amen's theory? Ritalin can make some people feel crazy. DR. DANIEL AMEN, PSYCHIATRIST: And that's why Ritalin has a bad reputation. It's not that it's a bad drug. It's a wonderful drug for the right person. It's a disaster for the wrong person. COHEN: A brain scan, he says, can tell the difference by looking at areas of high activity, the red areas, and inactivity in the brain. After seeing Tyler's scan, Dr. Amen put him on a very low dose of Ritalin, with dietary supplements to help counteract the side-effects. After scanning Eli (ph), Dr. Amen switched him from Ritalin to an anti-seizure medication. AMEN: Classic ADD, inattentive ADD. COHEN: Dr. Amen believes there are six kinds of ADD in all, each requiring a different type of treatment. (on camera): So this version of ADD, you recommended what drug? AMEN: An anti-seizure medicine and then a stimulant. COHEN: And for this version? AMEN: It would be an antidepressant. COHEN (voice-over): While several doctors we interviewed say Dr. Amen hasn't proven his theories are right, they do agree with him on one point. DR. EDWARD HALLOWELL, PSYCHIATRIST: Imaging is the wave of the future in psychiatry. We need to be able to look at the brain. (END VIDEOTAPE) COHEN: Now other doctors, including Dr. Hallowell, who we just heard from, prefer other techniques for looking at the brain. There's an EEG out there to look at the brain of ADHD kids or kids with ADD. Also, some people use MRIs. But it all points to the same thing, that many experts say, to really treat these kids well, we ought to be doing something to take a look at the brain -- Heidi.

1868397,2184546,CNN,Erin Burnett Outfront,"and as he tells us. And, you know, I think Michael Cohen has made the case that he paid this out of his own funds, that he had to take out a loan -- BURNETT: Right. BORGER: -- to repay this. And what Rudy Giuliani is saying is that, no, this was part of some retainer that Michael Cohen was on, and that's how this got paid. So in a way, you know, Rudy Giuliani, if I were on Cohen's legal team, I'd be calling Rudy Giuliani today and saying, what are you talking about here? Because they have a client who's been very specific about how he repaid this. And it seems to me, like Rudy Giuliani, who by the way just joined the legal team, maybe he's not up to speed on everything that's been going on the last month or six weeks. BURNETT: Yes. BORGER: But these two legal teams ought to be singing from the same song book, I would think. BURNETT: Right. And of course -- I mean, it would seem to me that you're going to have an issue with Michael Cohen being like, what do you mean, I deserve my retainer. That's separate. You owe me a $135,000 on top of it. BORGER: Of course, you know. BURNETT: I mean, that's a shock if that is the case. BORGER: Of course. BURNETT: Paul, you know, the point though when he says -- Rudy Giuliani says, even if the president was told, he wouldn't have remembered it. The only way this makes sense is if this was the sort of thing, and the sort of person, description of a person, to whom the president regularly would have heard that payments were being made to, hush payments, right? Would that change things though? You know, if this happened all the time, maybe the fact that it happened a few days before the election was just, you know, coincidence or circumstance if it happened all the time? P. RYAN: It wasn't coincidence or circumstance. The timing matters. Also the motive matters. We know that Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, she was talking to major national media outlets about going public with her story, and Rudy Giuliani said on Fox and Friends this morning, imagine if this story came out on October 15th. This was all about the election. It's obvious. And that the real problem here is the cover-up. Donald Trump could have made this payment without violating any campaign finance laws. It's permissible for him to have spent -- BURNETT: Right. P. RYAN: -- as much of his own money as he wanted to, to influence the election. He just had to do it transparently. Because Americans have a right to know who's spending money to influence their vote on election day. BURNETT: Yes. And of course, who knows how all this would played out. But, you know, if no one cared about the ""Access Hollywood"" tape, maybe they wouldn't have cared about this and",0.265006216751733,2018-05-03

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: The good news is that states like Washington, like California, countries like Italy, when they leaned into aggressive mitigation, they're being able to flatten their curve. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: Let's talk about that aggressive mitigation with the Democratic governor of one of those states, California, Gavin Newsom. Thank you so much for joining us, Governor. I appreciate it. I know your time is valuable. You have over 8,000 confirmed cases in your state, at least 171 deaths. You said there are 747 people in ICU beds in your state, that's 16 percent increase from yesterday. The virus peak in California is expected to come in the middle of May. So, what are you doing to make sure that California does not become the next Italy, the next New York? GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): Jake, and those 774 people represent a quadrupling just in the last six days of the number of people on ICU. So, we're not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination. But I am very proud of this state, the largest state in our Union. We're the first stay-at-home order where we're practicing physical distancing at a scale that's really done justice to helping us buy time and begin to bend that curve so we can prepare for a surge as you suggest, may come in the early part of May, maybe mid to late May. TAPPER: There's still more than a dozen states that do not have stay- at-home orders. You were one of the first states hit. Based on what we've seen from your state, based on your experience being on the tip of the spear of all this, do you have a message for the other governors who have not taken these strong measures, these extreme measures? Should everyone be issuing these stay-at-home orders? NEWSOM: My message is this: what are you waiting for? What more evidence do you need? If you think it's not going to happen to you, there are proof points all across this country, for that matter, around the rest of the world. Don't dream of regretting, lean into the moment, take responsibility and meet it head on. You'll never regret overcompensating at the moment so that you're preparing people for meeting this moment in a responsible way. And there's no greater intervention, period, full stop, none, than physical distancing. We talk about social distancing, but it's really physical distancing.

Let's listen to something you said back in September when you talked to the House Armed Services Committee about the military component here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BATISTE: Our army and marine corps are at a breaking point with little to show for it. The current surge in Iraq is too little, too late. (END VIDEO CLIP) FOREMAN: Would you say the same thing today militarily, that it's too little, too late or do you now see signs of encouragement? BATISTE: Tom, what I'd say is that the surge as the military component strategy is beginning to show signs of success. There's no question about that. But let's not forget that the solution in Iraq, however you define victory, is not going to be defined by the military. It must be a political solution. And if we're not very, very careful, if we don't radically change direction with respect to our strategy, with respect to mobilizing the country behind our exhausted military, with respect to finding the right political process in Iraq to ensure success, today's tactical successes will turn into strategic failures tomorrow. FOREMAN: Part of what you wrote along with Peter Hegeeth in the ""Washington Post"" was this - the counter-insurgency campaign led by General David Petraeus is the correct approach in Iraq. It is showing promise of success and if continued will provide the Iraqi government the opportunities it desperately needs to stabilize its country. It seems like the big question for you is still whether or not that government there or the Iraqis can capitalize on this at this point. BATISTE: Tom, here's a couple of thoughts. Right, the Iraqi government, the Iraqi factions, entities, must reconcile. And they, to this point, have shown little inclination to do that. The other important thing to remember is that a national strategy is based upon diplomacy, political reconciliation, economic recovery, military operations. There's a whole holistic approach to any kind of operation such as what we're doing in Iraq or Afghanistan. To depend entirely on the military is pure folly. And in my mind, that in large measure is what we're doing. We need to rethink the strategy. It must be regionally and globally focused to deal with extremism. And by the way, the first tool to use is not the military. There are other ways to deal with it. We must mobilize our country behind this effort. Less than 1% of the population is shouldering the burdens of Iraq and Afghanistan. The military is stretched thin. It cannot continue the cycle of deployments for much longer. We need to think of ways to fund this war much as our parents and grandparents did in previous world wars, with war bonds, people sacrificing in real meaningful ways. We need to get serious with our industrial base to provide the troops what they need. Mind resistant vehicles, better body armor, better helmets.",0.1678495676293033,2007-12-16

COLLINS: And I think that's such a big concern for parents, because no parent wants their child to even go to the hospital at all. And so stepping back, though, and looking at the new numbers from the CDC overnight, what is the significance to you of the CDC slashing its estimate of how much omicron is circulating in the United States right now? KOCIOLEK: To be honest, those estimates that they presented a week ago seemed much too high with what they projected for omicron to have increased, so the amount of delta that we have and with ho transmissible delta had. I'm not surprised to see that Lurie and the estimate. For all practical purposes, I'm not sure that number -- AVLON: All right. It looks like -- COLLINS: He was saying there, John -- unfortunately we lost him and we wanted to keep asking questions. He was saying he is not sure how much significance the CDC changing those numbers and the estimates. And I do think also it shows the delta variant is still fueling a lot of the surges that we are seeing in cases. And so it's not just omicron that people ought to be concerned about. It is still delta variant, which, of course, we know was dominant in the U.S. and in so many other countries for so long that was such a major issue. And I do want to remind viewers, we have an interview with the CDC director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, coming up to answer questions not just about those new numbers, about everything that you want to know about the new CDC guidance, about these pediatric hospitalizations.

The U.S. goal, as the president repeatedly has said, it is to get rid of Gadhafi once and for all. That's what the U.S. objective has been, is, and we will see if they're able to achieve that objective anytime soon. JOHNS: But that's very different from the goal of the U.N. resolution, which sort of creates a problem. BLITZER: Right. JOHNS: Right. The United Nations Security Council resolution, they reached a consensus, the Arab League, the 10 members of the United Nations Security Council that voted for it. Five members abstained, including Russia and China. But there is a difference between what the U.N. has authorized, what the military is now directly charged with doing, the U.S., British, French the others charged with doing, and what the president of the United States for weeks has now said is the U.S. policy, what the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, as recently as yesterday said is the U.S. policy, which is Libya without Gadhafi. So how do you achieve that? That's easier said than done. And if -- if in the end there's a stalemate, Gadhafi remains in charge of Tripoli in the west, the rebels remain in charge of Benghazi in the east, that's something that the U.S., at least the Obama administration will not be happy with. And they're going to see that as a setback. So they're taking it one step at a time right now.

We're starting to see cases tick up in Britain among unvaccinated folks and I'm worried that we could see that here in states with lower rates of vaccination. TAPPER: So, on that subject, a new study in ""JAMA"" out today finds that vaccinations alone are clearly won't be enough to stop the pandemic, that masks and physical is distancing are still required to get transmission rates down because of so many people who are not getting vaccinated, whether it's because they refuse to or they don't have access, they don't -- can't figure out how to get a shot. Do you think that states, some states, the ones you're referring to, have gotten rid of their mask mandates too quickly? RANNEY: You know, it depends on how many cases of COVID they want to see. There is an attitude it's each person out for themself. If you get sick, it's your fault. You've had the choice to go and get a vaccine. If you didn't want, it it's on you. I would like to think that's not how we work as a country, that we look out and we take care of each other. That's where universal masking in inside locations in particular, not so much outside, but inside, really is important in stopping the spread of this virus among the vulnerable. And, of course, it's worth making the point, Jake, that there are some folks who even after they are fully vaccinated may still need to mask, people who are immuno-suppressed, folks on chemo or with other immunosuppressant diseases, they need to stay masked and we need to create a community where that's okay for them. But I am worried about those states, particularly the ones who have lifted mask mandates for schools, they're putting those kids at risk. TAPPER: Put into context this news that we've read today that the Chinese government has just reported the first possible human case of a strain of bird flu. The Chinese government says the risk of large- scale spread is low. Obviously, a lot of people are very skeptical of what the Chinese government says these days. How do you view this news? RANNEY: So there's two things about this. One is that we have a great bird flu surveillance program that is set up nationally. We didn't have that for coronavirus. So we pick up these human or animal-to-human transmissions really early. They happen fairly frequently. Picking up a new case",0.0342766204752375,2021-06-01

BASH: Well, look, it has to. I'm, before coming on with you, was speaking with a lawmaker who was telling me that the governor of their state had some supplies coming to the state and the supplies were stopped because the federal government said, no, no, no, we're going to take over and there was confusion. And that has been the hallmark of this whole situation. In fairness, this is unprecedented, but that would all be alleviated if the federal government was more clear in how it's going to take over. We have heard several different things on several different days from the President himself about whether or not he is really going to implement the powers that he has, the Defense Production Act. That could make it more clear in how people and how states were going to get the supplies and maybe it's just that those supplies were much more needed in New York. That might be but governors aren't being communicated with to the extent that they hope. BURNETT: All right. Thank you all very much. And OUTFRONT next, just how widespread is this virus? It may mean everything to how the social distancing plays out. We have two epidemiologists with two very different views on the problem.

You know, Gary, my condolences to the death of your friend. Tell us a bit about him because people are saying he was this gentle giant, you know, 6`5"", very beloved and well known. We also know that he did have an aggravated assault charge in his past. I mean, was he a violent person? GARY SARGEANT, FOUNDER, OUTLAW MUSIC HALL OF FAME: Well, I`m going to tell you the same thing that I told anybody that has ever asked me the same question about Wayne Mills. Wayne Mills was by far the greatest most gentlest, loving human being that I ever in my 55 years on this planet had the honor of knowing, period. He would do things that you would go in explaining what he has done you would go who does that, and the answer was always Wayne. Wayne did things out of the kindness of his heart out of habit. He wouldn`t even think about it. He was by far the gentlest person that you would ever know. I want to clarify the Outlaw Music stuff that I have heard. Outlaw Music is not a genre. Outlaw Music, outlaw is an attitude. And this means that, he refused throughout his entire career to compromise his music or his believes in order to be commercially successfully. That is what Outlaw Music is. That is all that is. It is not a genre of music. It is an attitude. It is people who refused to and he refused. And he loved all independent musicians like nobody`s business. HOSTIN: And Gary, you can`t see this but we have been watching Wayne Mills` music video ""Redneck Hippie"" from YouTube. And I want to ask you, I mean, you are his friend. You`ve described him as the most gentle and loving person you have ever met in your life. Does this make sense to you? Smoking being called the reason for the shooting. The shooter is saying that he had to shoot your friend in self-defense? Does that make sense to you? SARGEANT: Number one, I can promise you it was not about smoking. Number two, it was not self-defense. A man does not get shot in the back of his head in self-defense, period. We do not know what happened. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOSTIN: I`m Sunny Hostin in for Nancy Grace tonight. Thank you so much for staying with me.

This is the contradiction, whatever you want to call it. Republicans generally love free trade. BORGER: Speaker of the House supported the TPP. And these are Republican, right? So -- but, he had the wind at his back on that one. But the word that you hear Steve Bannon use constantly is sovereignty. America first. So, what he's trying to do -- and this applies to the EU as well, and this is going to cause problems for Rex Tillerson -- is that America now wants to have bilateral trade deals. And if we have bilateral trade deals, what happens to the countries we don't have deals with? And what happens to us, by the way, as a result? You know this better than I. It could hurt us, as well. What happens if we start slapping tariffs, for example, on certain countries? That hurts our consumers, yes. But this is all part and parcel of their thinking here.

Where is this role on industrial policy? BORGER: I think Jared Kushner's role is a good question and I think we don't really know the answer to it. He seems to be first among equals at the White House. He is part of the strategic initiatives group. He is clearly involved in bringing in the CEOs.

And CNN's Kelli Arena joins us now with her continuing series on the FBI turning 100 years old. The mob's still a major target for investigators. KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It sure is, John. Obviously fighting terrorism is the FBI's number one priority but that doesn't mean it can simply just stop doing some of the other things that it's been doing for decades. And fighting organized crime is one of them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARENA: Mafia boss John Gotti is dead and buried. The old Italian neighborhood has gone global. But if you think the sun has finally set on La Cosa Nostra, forget about it. MIKE GAETA, FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT: Italian organized crime here in the United States is still the most dominant organized crime problem that affects American society. ARENA: Still powerful, yes, but it's been severely weakened by decades of prosecutions and undercover investigations. Just this year more than 50 alleged members of Gotti's Gambino crime family were indicted. The rap sheet had a familiar ring - extortion, labor racketeering, gambling, murder. The modern mafia started back in the 1930s with godfather Lucky Luciano but it took the FBI two decades to catch on. MARK MERSHON, FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Well, in truth, J. Edgar Hoover, the founding director, so to speak, of the FBI was somewhat resistant we understand to accepting organized crime as a legitimate target. ARENA: That allowed the mafia to thrive in cities like Chicago and New York. In the late '60s the FBI reloaded. Agents received congressional authorization to use electronic surveillance, and in 1970, Congress passed the Rico act, an antiracketeering law. GAETA: Rather than arresting one person for a murder, you could arrest the boss who ordered it, you could arrest the captain who supplied the guns. ARENA: And when the mafia could no longer provide for the families of its jailed members, wise guys began to squeal. SEAMUS MCELEARNEY, FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT: What happens once a person goes to jail, that's it, they're on their own. So, in the end you have to choose your real family over the mob family.

All birth announcements printed in the paper came directly from the birth records of the hospital. Barack Obama not only has the same proof of birth as millions of other Hawaiians, he also has the current governor's memories of him as a baby. (on camera) You saw him as an infant? GOV. NEIL ABERCROMBIE, HAWAII: Oh, sure. Of course. TUCHMAN (voice-over): Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie says he met the future president soon after he was born. Because he was close to both of Barack Obama's parents. He remembers his mother, Ann Dunham, living in Hawaii and pregnant and remembers celebrating the birth with his friends, the Obamas. ABERCROMBIE: His mom and dad went to school with me here, and with other folks here in Hawaii. And of course, we had no idea at the time that the future president of the United States was that little boy, that little baby, and we were very, very happy, of course, that that took place. TUCHMAN: The former director of the Hawaii Health Department said she talked to us because she felt it was her duty for the truth to come out. (on camera) Does it anger you that this has become such a controversy and it's taking attention away from issues that are important to you? FUKINO: No, I find it a bit amusing, and in the sense that it keeps resurfacing, and -- over and over again, despite whatever I say. And it really tells us that the whole conspiracy notion out there that, if there's an issue that needs to have a following, it will find one. ABERCROMBIE: And I would just like to ask people who have this political orientation towards the president, respect us here in Hawaii. Respect his mother and father. Respect the people that I loved, and the people that I knew, and the little boy who grew up here in paradise and became president.

It seems like it's deja vu all over again, Elliot. ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: It really does, Natalie. It's quite incredible to think that over the course of the past 12 months or so, we've already had two elections. They were inconclusive. And here we are again doing the same thing all over again with opinion polls suggesting that we're going to get exactly the same outcome. It should be said that that's not putting people off from voting. We have seen -- I think he described it as a trickle rather than a torrent of voters turning up at this polling station in Jerusalem. It's still quite early hours though. Polls have been open for just over an hour. They will remain open until 10:00 p.m. this evening local time. It's also worth noting that today's election day, just like all election days, is a public holiday. So what a lot of people do is they cast their vote and then go out for the day or go shopping, or they do it the other way around.

As of right now, there are no additional restrictions or limitations on what civilians can do in Israel along the northern border. And this is where, as you mentioned, we could see a potential Iranian response. That's because there are Iranian proxies in the region including Hezbollah, right across the border here in Lebanon behind me. As if to emphasize that point, there is in fact a Hezbollah flag just on the hill here in Lebanon. That would be one option for Iran to respond if it chooses to do this. Another would be Iranian proxies in Syria. That is why there's a security assessment to see how Iran might respond and if that response could be pointed towards Israel. Iran also has other options. Iran has influence with Islamic jihad in Gaza. So that can be a response. The potential firing of rockets. And local media is reporting that Israeli embassies and consulates around the world on elevated alert. That too a potential target. As we look for the security assessment, we're also waiting to see if there is a political response. This will be something that Israel's political establishment from Prime Minister Netanyahu on down will applaud, will congratulate, although at this point the prime minister, the defense minister, the foreign minister, have not issued an official statement. Perhaps they're trying not to provoke the situation at all. But we have heard former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren, and he put out a tweet a short time ago saying, ""Qasem Soleimani, responsible for the murder of thousands -- Syrians, Iraqis, Americans, Israelis, Yemenis -- and for plotting terrorist attacks around the world is dead. Justice is done and American deterrence in the Middle East restored. All those threatened by Iran are grateful."" And that will be the response of the political establishment as they choose to make it -- Christine. ROMANS: All right. Oren Liebermann for us on the border there in Israel and Lebanon, thank you.

Former vice president Joe Biden says, ""The administration statement says that its goal is to deter future attacks by Iran. But this action almost certainly will have the opposite effect. President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox. And he owes the American people an explanation of the strategy.""

But that position, I don't think, is sustainable, and I think the FBI is actually starting to walk away from it. CHETRY: Well, you say that religion, specifically Islam, is a sensitive subject for the Bureau, and if Major Hasan had been an officer in the cold war and he had expressed sympathy for the Soviet Union, perhaps corresponded with somebody, he would have been surrounded by counterintelligence officers. Do you think that political correctness played a role in missing warning signs? GERECHT: Certainly. I mean, I think in both the case for the military and the case for the FBI, people were too sensitive to religion. I mean, this is a long-standing problem in the United States. It's -- it is, in many ways, commendable. But when you're dealing with counterterrorism, I think you have to be pretty straightforward and you have to say that someone who is Muslim, who expresses fraternity, a greater fraternity for the Islamic community abroad, who believes the United States is engaged in criminal acts in the Middle East, has to be considered a potential terrorist threat. CHETRY: So what do you do, then, in practical purposes? You need Muslims to be serving in our military. Most of them, I guess you could say, are serving honorably and helping out. So what is the FBI to do? GERECHT: Well, I mean the FBI, I think, when it receives information that a member of the American military who is Muslim is corresponding with a radical cleric in Yemen who has a long history with al Qaeda, that alarms should go off. I mean, the vast majority of American Muslims are serving, and the soldiers are serving honorably and there's no issue. That's why we have counterintelligence services. They are supposed to sift through these things. They're supposed to be curious. They're supposed to be adult. And they're to look for individuals who have all the warning signs that we've got a serious problem. CHETRY: Your op-ed also calls out our president. In fact, you say that President Obama's, quote, ""Determined effort not to mention Islam in terrorist discussions weaken America's counterterrorism."" You also charge that he's on the wrong side of history when it comes to this issue. What do you mean? GERECHT: I mean, it's not a good idea for the president of the United States to essentially take a position which is, say, to the left of what the 9/11 commission report did. I mean, the 9/11 commission report, which was very sensitive to Muslim issues in the United States, to religion, nevertheless said quite clearly that our problem is Islamist terrorism. The president doesn't want to do this. I think he's probably well intentioned, but it isn't helpful if you've got counterintelligence services that are already sensitive to the issue of surveilling possible Muslim threats in the United States, to say",0.0668912947414935,2009-11-24

So to be here in the Vatican especially at a time like this is awesome. MARQUEZ: All Catholic, you go to church often? (CROSSTALK) MARQUEZ: How important is this decision? THOMPSON: Extremely. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Extremely important. MARQUEZ: Why? Why so important? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We've been in Catholic school for 14 years now. And we've been through two popes now. THOMPSON: Two. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And so it's just an opportunity of a lifetime and experience, especially after this last papacy. MARQUEZ: There are the cardinals going into the Sistine Chapel to select the new pope. What do you hope comes out of the decision? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I hope it's a pope that can be around for a while and someone who can relate to the Catholics to all over the world. Because there's so many Catholics from so many different countries. And I think it's so cool to be like part of that religion. MARQUEZ: And being in Rome, lovely Italy, while this is going on, how -- what is your sense of excitement? Obviously, you're excited to come to Italy. But to have this happen while you're here? THOMPSON: I just keep hoping to see smoke. (LAUGHTER) I keep looking around, you know. I keep thinking I see it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Waiting for the bells. THOMPSON: Yes, bells go off. MARQUEZ: It's that big bell right up there. That's the one. That big bell on the left side of the Basilica that will chime in the new pope. Thank you very much.

They'll be getting ready for the veni creator. (CROSSTALK) The hats, they're ecclesiastical. CUOMO: What does that mean? ALLEN: It's basically an Italian word for skull cap. It's color- coded so the cardinals wear red. Only one guy in the church gets to wear the white one. That's the man who walks out of the Sistine Chapel as pope. CUOMO: Are they singing now?

WHITFIELD: So sergeant, this was something you were dealing with. Did you also hear from other fellow troop members who were dealing with the same kind of thing? Did you guys ever talk about it, what to do, what's next, when will it all end? FIRTH: I have a few close friends that we've pretty much formed a support group for ourselves. We've dealt with a lot of issues like that as well as seeing about the psychiatrist and psychologist. WHITFIELD: You did reach out to the psychologist and psychiatrists there at Walter Reed. So many people do not. Earlier today, on CNN, in the morning NEWSROOM, we did speak with a colonel, the chief of psychiatry at Walter Reed and he says a concerted effort is made to try to identify soldiers, their mental fitness to be redeployed or even simply to be deployed in the first place. Let's listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. JOHN BRADLEY, CHIEF OF PSYCHIATRY, WALTER REED: The military really takes very aggressively this question of is a soldier fit to deploy to combat? And we screen soldiers on the, as they're preparing for deployment really to make sure that they are not suffering a mental illness that's going to either be effected negatively by the deployment or be a cause for concern. (END OF VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD: So sergeant, your response, is that mental fitness test adequate? FIRTH: Yes, ma'am. I would say it is. WHITFIELD: Really? Is anything, I guess is there an area that needs some work upon? How do you reach these three out of five soldiers who say I don't want to come forward because I'm afraid of this stigma. What more can be done so that everyone feels comfortable about getting mental health? FIRTH: Honestly, I don't know how to answer that question. WHITFIELD: Really? FIRTH: For me, it was my personal convictions. I don't know. I'm a sergeant, yes, but I'm still pretty low on the totem pole, and I'm hoping that other soldiers that are going to see this that regardless of rank, they'll see that hey, just because you have it doesn't mean that you might not be able to get a job or that you're going to be treated a certain way by people. The fact of the matter is that you need help. I realized it and I went for it.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) CABRERA: A Colorado woman has filed a federal lawsuit after she says she was forced to give birth alone in her Denver jail cell after more than five hours of crying for help. You see it in the video. This is from July of 2018. Nurses and deputies were close by Diana Sanchez but provided little aid. At one point someone actually slides what Sanchez's lawyer says is an absorbent pad under her cell door. But ultimately, she had to do everything herself and delivering her baby. We're not showing the full footage of the childbirth but you could see on her face just how much pain she was in. Sanchez said in the weeks after her birth that at the time of her most urgent need the nurses and deputies made her feel so rejected. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DIANA SANCHEZ, GAVE BIRTH BY HERSELF IN JAIL CELL: I felt helpless. Nobody was helping me. There were so many people there and nobody lifted a finger basically. It is indescribable. And what hurts me more though is the fact that nobody cared. (END VIDEO CLIP) CABRERA: Her attorney said Sanchez had been arrested on an identity theft charge for cashing a check that was written to her sister. The attorney adds Sanchez took full responsibility and was ultimately sentenced to two years' probation. CNN's Scott McLean has been tracking the story for us. Scott, no medical help for the mom or the baby during the delivery. How are officials in Denver explaining this? SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Ana, so the Denver Sheriff Department which operates the jail said it did an internal review after this that found deputies did nothing wrong, that they followed protocol. But it also sent a statement that read in part to make sure nothing like this happens again. The Denver Sheriff Department has changed its policies to ensure that pregnancy inmates who are in any stage of labor are now transported immediately to the hospital. Now surveillance video from inside of her cell shows that she was brought breakfast around 5:00 in the morning that day. And that is when she says she first informed the guards that she was having contractions. A couple of hours later you could see in the footage that she's knocking on the door to that cell to try to get someone's attention because according to the lawsuit that is when her water broke. Her lawyer Mari Newman explains what happened about 15 minutes later, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARI NEWMAN, ATTORNEY OF WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH IN JAIL CELL: After Miss Sanchez reported her water had broken, instead of providing actual medical care all that a nurse provided to her was a thin pad to absorb some of the water that had broken.

(END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: More on the implications, repercussions of what we know so far, where there is leading, and why the fight is far from over. Let's talk strategy from the left and the right with political contributor Paul Begala and Mary Matalin, who was an adviser to Dick Cheney when he was vice president. Paul, Vice President Cheney is essentially saying that President Obama is politicizing the Justice Department and damaging national security. PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. And I -- I got to say, for Dick Cheney to be accusing anyone of politicizing the Justice Department, after what the Bush people did, it's a little like -- you know, I don't know. It's like Paris Hilton saying, ""You know, that girl's a little too slutty for me."" It's preposterous. He has absolutely no grounds to say it. Eric Holder, the attorney general who was smeared today by the vice president, when he was a Democratic-appointed U.S. attorney, by a Democratic president, you know what he did? He indicted the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee when we were trying to pass a health care bill through his committee. Eric Holder is beyond politics, believe me. And it's a really sleazy thing for Dick Cheney to say, particularly given the Bush record of politicizing the Justice Department. COOPER: Mary? MARY MATALIN, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Anderson, of course, even its redacting sense, you could tell from these released documents, the CIA dump, that these programs, these interrogations were highly successful. They thwarted second-wave mass casualty attacks. They revealed domestic cells. They were responsible for the -- for the bulk of the intelligence, which is our first line of defense against these terrorists. And they resulted in the apprehension of almost every al Qaeda extremist that we got. So... COOPER: But, Mary, Mary, the report isn't... MATALIN: But Dick Cheney is not playing politics. COOPER: But, Mary, the report is not saying that enhanced interrogation, as they call it, which others call torture, resulted in these things. In fact, it's kind of ambiguous on that. And, all along, Vice President Cheney has been saying these classified reports are going to show that enhanced interrogation techniques saved lives and -- and resulted in -- in -- in terrorist activity being stopped.

There are red flag warnings throughout the San Diego region. Take a look just the temperatures they saw yesterday, John Wayne Airport had the warmest temperature in the entire country yesterday at 106 degrees. If you're not familiar with this area, it is close to the coastline. Unbelievable. Look at Long Beach, 101 out towards San Diego, talking about those temperatures into the 90s today. Definitely a difficult concept. A lot of people don't get it, but you have the cold air, remember the cool-down towards the Midwest? The cold air comes down the mountain passes and canyons, and by the time it gets to the coastline, you get the extreme heat and very dry conditions. Those humidities, they drop. You're not even seeing the recovery this morning. Temperatures and humidities very low. Typically, you want to see the recovery at least up to 50 percent in the overnight hours. Still dry in the afternoon, expected to stay dry. Here's the one piece of good news we have. High pressure's currently in place. It's allowing all of the canyon winds to be out there. Eventually as we get towards Friday we will start to see more of the onshore flow and that marine layer return, which will bring up the humidities and temperatures down, but unfortunately, today looks like it may be rougher than yesterday temperature-wise.

CAMEROTA: You were talking about China and how you'll have to use -- the White House will have to use the leverage of China to help with North Korea. It's confusing because Steve Bannon, one of the top advisers to President Trump, has said some things that have been seen as aggressive, certainly not conciliatory, on China almost a year ago. Here is what Steve Bannon said in a Breitbart interview about what will happen in the South China Sea. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE BANNON, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: We're going to war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years, aren't we? There's no doubt about it. They're -- they're taking the sandbars and making basically stationary aircraft carriers and putting missiles on those. They come here to the United States and in front of your face, and you understand how much important is, and say it's an ancient territorial sea. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAMEROTA: That might have been bluster back then, almost a year ago, but what does that tell you about moving forward now? BLINKEN: Well, I'd say, Alisyn, first, you know, reality has a way of intruding. And when you become president, when all of these problems start to come at you, you realize you have to deal with them and you have to deal with them with partners and allies. And sometimes those partners, like China, you've got profound differences on other issues, including things like the South China Sea. But when it comes to North Korea, we have to find ways to work together. That's the only way to effectively confront the threat posed by North Korea's missile program, its nuclear program. So I -- I think, at least I hope, that this is the administration adjusting to that reality. CAMEROTA: Today we're going to see President Trump meet with prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau. How do you think this is going to go? Because they are not necessarily completely philosophically aligned or tight allies. So what are we going to see? BLINKEN: Well, you know, I think they're going to put a good face on it. And the relationship is so important to both of us. Our number one trading partner. One of our closest partners around the world. But, look, there are real differences. The starkest one recently, of course, is on immigration. We've been trying to shut the door through the administration on immigration and refugees, Canada is one of the most welcoming countries in the world. It's not only the right thing to do, it's actually the smart thing to do.

Masks for upstate hospitals we can address that. So we can fill that need as of now. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- testing -- first of all, people are wondering have you been tested? CUOMO: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And why not? CUOMO: Because I've not been exposed to anyone who is positive. I don't have a fever. I don't have any symptoms. And I don't want to waste a test. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Albany -- the two major hospitals in Albany -- are saying they're not going to be able to test members of the public, even though they have symptoms. They have to save it for the health care workers, is that a concern? CUOMO: The hospital -- we are testing by the same protocol all across the state -- Karen. If you meet that protocol, then you get a test. And it's on the Web site. If you have been exposed to someone positive, if you are showing symptoms, if you meet that protocol -- you get a test. And again, we are testing more than any state in the United States of America. We are testing more per capita than China and Korea. So yes, no state -- no country can give everybody a test who wants a test. But that shouldn't be the goal either. This is not just, you know, I want a test to make myself feel better. And by the way, it won't even make you feel better because ok you didn't have -- you tested negative at 10:00 a.m., but then you went and you talked to six people, maybe you're positive again. You know, you'll never solve that neurosis, right. You know, that anxiety. But anybody who fits that protocol can get a test. And more people are getting tests in this state than anywhere else.

GARAMENDI: Well, I will tell you that I was part of a classified hearing less than two weeks ago in which we discussed in that, from the top people operating in the Afghan space, that they were actually going to increase the pressure, increase the number of troops by a small amount, and put more pressure on the Taliban to force them to the table. Now, the president is going exactly the other direction. Now, that may be that the strategy radically changed in the intervening two weeks, or maybe the president just woke up one morning and said, well, I'm the president, I'm the commander in chief and I'm leaving.

At the Glasgow climate conference, each country will be judged on whether it's cutting emissions sufficiently to ensure that crucial 1.5 degree target is still achievable. The scientific consensus says the goal is now slipping beyond reach, and the consequences will be disastrous. BOB WARD, GRANTHAM RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON CLIMATE AND THE ENVIRONMENT, LSE: Without action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, we could see temperatures go well beyond 3 degrees of warming by the end of the century, something that the Earth has not experienced for three million years, long before humans were on the planet. It would be a very, very, different world. BLACK: U.S. leadership, through example, is vital at Glasgow to boost other countries' ambitions. The Biden administration's plan is bold. Half U.S. omissions by 2030, hit net zero carbon by 2050. WARD: That's fantastic, but they need to demonstrate that they can deliver that. And the lack of agreement at federal level and, indeed, in many states, to the outside world looks like that will be a major challenge. BLACK: Success also depends on big, new commitments from China. The world's biggest polluter is responsible for more than a quarter of global emissions. China's long-term goal is becoming carbon neutral by 2060. STERN: So it's quite important that China move much more than they have. Again, there's that long-term goal is pretty good, but between now and 2030, they haven't pledged, really, anything. BLACK: The urgent challenge for China and many developing countries is to stop burning coal for electricity, while still rapidly, growing their economies and lifting populations out of poverty. The issue is going to be a key focus of Glasgow, along with finance from rich countries to help poorer countries make the change. But even before the conference opens, it's clear there are tensions over some countries' unwillingness to offer detailed, ambitious commitments. JOHN KERRY, U.S. CLIMATE ENVOY: We're behind. And we have to stop the B.S. that is being thrown at us by a number of countries that have not been willing to sign up to what Great Britain has signed up to, we've signed up to, Japan, Canada, the E.U. That is, to keep 1.5 degrees alive. BLACK: It's expected Glasgow will deliver progress, but will it be enough?

That when you see there is an avalanche warning and it's a three out of a five. Is that a stay away or is that a manageable risk with the right equipment? BRUCE TREMPER, DIRECTOR, UTAH AVALANCHE CENTER: Yes. The avalanche risk is level three out of a scale of one to five. That's level orange. And here in the United States, that means dangerous conditions and that you should choose conservative terrain. In other words, stay off of slopes that are between about 34 and 45 degrees in steepness. So if you pay attention to the avalanche report before heading out, then you, they tell you where it's safe, where it's not safe, and what kind of terrain you should be in for that particular day. BALDWIN: When it is in orange, when it is a three and you're out there on the slopes and you start to hear, I don't even know if it would be a crunching or eerie silence. I mean, what is the noise that signals an avalanche is beginning? And then how much time do you have to get out of there? TEMPER: Yes. The key, of course, is just avoiding being caught in an avalanche. Because once you're caught in the avalanche -- and by the way, almost in all cases, it is trigger by the victim or somebody in the victim's party. But if you're caught in an avalanche, there's not that much you can do. The whole mountainside are shatters like a pane of glass and then it just roars to the bottom very, very quickly. Then it can go up to 80 miles an hour. They're very, very dangerous avalanches. One out of four people are killed by the trauma of hitting trees and rocks on the way down. And then once you're buried, then they're extremely dangerous. Because there's plenty of air in the snow to breathe. That's not the problem. But it's just our own carbon dioxide that's the problem. You know, we breathe out into the snow and then we breathe our carbon dioxide back in. So it's like breathing into a paper bag, you know, you pass out pretty quickly. And you've only got about 15 minutes to live on to the snow. That's why your partners have to get you out from under the snow very, very quickly.

CHAMBLISS: Well, certainly we gave him every opportunity to destroy, hide, give away those weapons of mass destruction. Even Bill Clinton has come out this week and said, when he left office, he was absolutely certain that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. So I think the important point is that we're going to continue to look for them, we'll ultimately find them, but we removed a guy who we know had weapons of mass destruction and had the capability and probably the determination to use them to kill and harm Americans, and he no longer has that ability.

Earlier I sat down with the foreign minister. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BLITZER: Foreign Minister, thanks so much for joining us. Welcome to Washington. Let's get right to the important questions of the moment. There have been some who have suggested U.S.-Turkish relations hit a 50-year low as a result of your parliament's refusal to let U.S. troops invade Iraq from the north. How badly damaged has the relationship been? ABDULLAH GUL, TURKEY'S FOREIGN MINISTER: Well, Turkish-American relations are so deep and historical. From time to time sometimes between the friends, between the families we have difficulties, but trust each other to overcome all this. I'm sure we will overcome all this and we will put everything on its track. BLITZER: Remind our viewers in the United States, indeed around the world, why did you -- why did the public opinion in Turkey, why was it so adamantly opposed to letting the U.S. military move in toward Iraq from the north? GUL: Well, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) leaving Turkey easy to understand that",0.0596813899639719,2003-07-27

We had eight points, and being equipped with the tracers would allow him to sit atop of his weapon like this and just spray the plunging fire down into the crowd. HARLOW: All right. A few other things we know, Phil Mudd. One, that two of those shots reached a fuel tank all the way at McCarron Airport. All the way, you know, further than the concert at the airport. And didn't blow up or anything. They hit it. Whether it was meant to or not, we don't know. And that he left a note in his room, a note with numbers that the sheriff says is not a manifesto, is not a suicide note. Any insight those two things give us? PHIL MUDD, CNN COUNTERTERRORISM: He has an operational plan we're not aware of. If you look at other characteristics, he looked at other locations. You're talking about Chicago, Illinois. We see now potentially a separate target at the airport. We know he was a meticulous-- HARLOW: Just a note, by the way. Sorry to interrupt, but this is-- CUOMO: What is it? HARLOW: This is not a close up, but they found a note, highlighted there. CUOMO: OK. MUDD: If you look at his background, a meticulous guy in terms of how his family talks about how he was playing the numbers on the slots, meticulous in terms of planning this operation. So let's put those two together quickly. Meticulous guy. He's looking at potentially multiple targets. I think the note relates to an operational plan. A guy who wanted to write down, like you write down your laundry list. ""This is everything I'm thinking about. This is how I'm going to execute is it."" I suspect we're going to realize, as the feds say and as the cops say, this is not a manifesto. It's not a suicide note. It's a guy who's very fastidious, saying, ""I better chart this out. This is important."" CUOMO: So the ""how"" is important, because it can lead you to an accomplice or where he got help or no help. OK. But there's still the biggest piece missing. What would motivate somebody to do something so evil and certainly not spur of the moment. Certainly not having snapped. And we don't have any proof of any type of untreated mental illness. So where does that leave you? GAGLIANO: Well, we know that there was terror created by what he did. Chris, authorities have been careful not to classify this as terrorism. Because again, we have the violence and the intimidation. We just don't have the defined or gleaned political motive or social motive here. I think, as we start to build this out, there's two things that we're looking at. Phil can certainly speak to this. We're looking at two different angles for intelligence gathering in this.

Now, Michael Joseph was the Chief Executive of Safaricom when he helped found M-Pesa. He told his employees he wanted a million users in the first year or they'd be fired. (BELL RINGING) The rest is history. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL JOSEPH, FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE, SAFARICOM: The reason for the success in Kenya and particularly in Kenya is because when we started out, people forget, we spent $10 million in our first year of investing in M- Pesa. What we spent the number one was the distribution network. You can go anywhere in Kenya within 200 meters, you will find an M-Pesa agent. That is the secret of success. And when you -- when I send you money or if I don't even send you money, if you sign up to M-Pesa, you want to know -- and in fact, you get money, you can take it out anywhere at any time. And that's why we built a huge distribution network. So it was a very -- a very confident of people to take their money out. QUEST: So what's the incidence of people just leaving the money in M-Pesa unless they need a bit of shortcut, but they just leave it in there and use it as a -- because they -- it's so widely accepted when even the newspaper vendor accepts it. You just -- if you receive money from -- you just leave it there and spend it. JOSEPH: Yes, that's what the people do. In the beginning, in the early days you sent money in -- you sent some money and immediately they went and took it out. Now, the next -- to your previous question, when they start to leave the money in for two or three days, that money sits in a current account, a trust account which is not owned by Safaricom, it's owned by external trustees. And that money generates interest overnight interest. In fact, we are the biggest buyer of government bonds at the moment. Seventy percent of the government bonds in Kenya are M-Pesa trust account funds. That money earns interest. When we started out, we didn't know it would be so successful. We had no clue. So we just thought the interest would be just enough to pay the bank fees and all the fees and things like that.

BLAIR: Here in this extraordinary piece of desert is where the future in the early 21st century of the world's security is going to be played out. OAKLEY: But that piece of desert is too the crucible where NATO's credibility and readiness for a wider world-wide role is being tested since it took responsibility for Afghanistan security. And the Alliance's commanders have struggled to get member countries to contribute enough troops or equipment. MICHAEL WILLIAMS, ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE: Even the initial NATO deployment to Afghanistan was never seen as sufficient. The Afghans were always asking for more troops. The secretary general was really going around with a cup asking for more troops and it didn't really happen. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The going has also been tough from time to time, I must admit. OAKLEY: That's one problem for NATO's political leaders to address at their summit, but there's another. A number of countries with contingents serving in Afghanistan have imposed so-called caveats, refusing to let their soldiers go to danger areas. It infuriates their allies in the hot spots. LIAM FOX, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE DEFENSE SECRETARY: There's no such thing as NATO light. You are either in NATO or you are not. Being there implies a set of responsibilities which ought to be carried out.

JAAP DE HOOP SCHEFFER, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: If I have the choice of having a force with a certain limitation or no force at all, my choice would be clear. Nevertheless, let me reiterate, my bottom line is that we should have caveat-free forces, solidarity in the alliance demands caveat-free forces.

Where are they being drawn right now as we look toward the midterms? CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, $250,000 battle line is basically what we're talking about here. (LAUGHTER) CROWLEY: Those who make above it, at least a household that makes above it or households who make below it, and that's where it is. But really what this is a battle over is who is more for the middle class. I think that's why you saw John Boehner a couple of weeks ago saying, well, if I got a bill that was only for middle-class tax cuts, of course I would go ahead and vote for it, sort of giving up the store a lot of his fellow Republicans felt. So it's really about, running up to an election, who is the most for the middle class. And that's where the rhetorical battle is. FOREMAN: And it looked like there was a fracture early in the week in the Republican side because of what Boehner said, but then within 48 hours, there was a fracture on the Democratic side. CROWLEY: Yes. I mean, first of all, you have, I think, more than 30 Democrats writing and going, listen, everybody's tax cuts ought to be extended in January, not just those making $250,000 and lower. And then you had Speaker Nancy Pelosi coming out and saying there's just no justification for having tax cuts remain for the wealthier Americans, but saying in the same news conference, the only thing I can tell you for sure is that the middle-class tax cuts will be extended. This sort of opened the door for Republicans, who said, well, this means that she's, you know, trying to have it both ways.

We begin with light at the end of the tunnel, the U.S. may finally be turning a corner on the pandemic. As of today, almost 60 percent of all U.S. adults have received at least one COVID vaccine dose, according to the CDC, and COVID cases are dropping across the country. If you're looking for a dramatic example, check out this map. This is not a single state in the red zone, anywhere in the U.S. right now. Dr. Anthony Fauci even suggesting it may be time to rethink more of our mask restrictions, specifically indoors. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS HOST: Former head of the FDA Scott Gottlieb say, it's time to start relaxing the indoor mask mandates. Is he right? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: No, I think so, and I think you're going to probably be seeing that as we go along and as more people get vaccinated. The CDC will be almost in real-time, George, updating their recommendations and their guidelines. But, yes, we do need to start being more liberal as we get more people vaccinated. (END VIDEO CLIP) CABRERA: So, that's the good news. The bad news is that the vaccination rate is slowing down, considerably, the White House saying today that several states, in fact, are even turning down their full allocation of vaccine doses. And that's frustrating for public health officials because CNN crunched the numbers and we came up with this, 80 percent of the U.S. population lives within five miles of all three vaccines, meaning they can choose which one they want, just five miles. Joining us now is CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. And, Elizabeth, we just heard Dr. Fauci say it may be time to start easing mask restrictions. Do vaccinations support a move like that? ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. You can almost hear Dr. Fauci nudging the CDC to let loose a little bit on this. For example, if you're at a small gathering with four or five families, all the adults are vaccinated, do you really need to be wearing a mask? The CDC at this point says, yes, but I think a lot of experts are telling me, you know what, maybe you don't hug the kids but maybe you don't really need to be wearing a mask. Now, let's talk a little bit about how vaccines -- how the vaccine rate, vaccination rate is falling. You sort of mentioned that, Ana. Let's take a look at what that actually looks like. If you look at this graph, the white line, you can see, it just takes this dip starting around a month ago. That's the number of vaccine doses administered.

It's not just that 25 people received clearances that probably shouldn't have it. What were the reasons why their clearance in the first place was denied and rejected? What are the reasons why people felt they may be compromised? There may be information that could be used against them. We're talking about the top secrets of the nation. And Cummings is right when he says this is bigger than the Hillary Clinton emails. It is. I worked at the Oversight Committee for republicans for the better part of five years. And I can tell you, if this had happened under the Obama administration, republicans will be holding hearings, issuing subpoenas and saying the same thing. SCIUTTO: Where are they on this issue then? Because, of course, the Hillary Clinton issue was in large part because there were classified information on these emails sent to the private server. There was so much talk about that, the emails marked C for confidential, et cetera. You remember it. This is more comprehensive, is it not, and involves really overruling security agencies saying there is an issue here. That's different. Are there any republicans who are raising their hand and saying we should be concerned about this? BARDELLA: Unfortunately, not. And that's what's puzzling because you're right. At the time for the Hillary Clinton and the whole Benghazi episode that lasted for four years, it was all about security. There was all about worrying about classified information. Nobody, by the way, was questioning whether Hillary Clinton was qualified to receive the information, which is what we're talking about right now. The republicans' default position has said, well, actually, it wasn't 25 people. It was only four or five who worked directly in the White House for the President. When that's your default that only four or five people may not have been able to get the information, that's not very strong ground. SCIUTTO: Plus Jared and Ivanka, which we mentioned that as well. On the Mueller report, the big question, let's throw out the law for a moment because it's a political judgment to some degree because Barr seems to have a lot of leeway. Will he allow evidence in this report to go public, evidence that Mueller found because he cited it, that the President obstructed justice? Will he let that out there or will Barr fall back on Justice Department protocols and him saying, Listen, I don't want to put stuff out there that's going to to sully people's reputations? How is this going to end? BARDELLA: Well, it certainly looks like they're not going to meet the Tuesday deadline. Hence, they'll vote tomorrow, the Judiciary Committee, on subpoenaing the report.

DONALD TRUMP, REAL ESTATE BUSINESS TYCOON: We need somebody that knows something about business, about negotiating, about what's happening. Otherwise we're not going to have a country left. MORGAN: Plus why Trump says China is no longer just eating America's lunch but its dinner, too. And what he thinks Washington should do about it. Also ""Keeping America Great.""

Newt Gingrich told me he'd tried to attack Mitt Romney on private equity and failed. Listen to what he said just last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We found out when we got in a fight with Mitt Romney over this that it didn't work. That people understand free enterprise. People realize sometimes you succeed, sometimes you fail. But they refuse to take a one-sided view of it. (END VIDEO CLIP) MORGAN: So is attacking Mitt Romney on private equity a winning strategy for President Obama or was Cory Booker right the first time? Is it just nauseating? Joining me now for more on our big story, a man who thought he was the perfect person to ask about private equity. Donald Trump, on a primetime exclusive. Donald, how are you? TRUMP: Hello, Piers.

MORGAN: He is and we'll come back to the ""Apprentice"" a little later. I want to talk to you, though, about this whole Bain Capital, Mitt Romney, Barack Obama row. What do you make of the basic substance of this debate, which is whether Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital was predominantly a good one or a bad one? TRUMP: Well, it wasn't a good one. It was a great one. He did a fantastic job. He did so well, actually, that, you know, he set records over there. And that's what we need",0.1700536084879295,2012-05-22
1430654,1745207,CNN,The Lead With Jake Tapper,"It comes to physics and inertia, a matter where you are in the train and what inertia is going to continue after it derails. As you can see in pictures from this tragedy, the continuing cars behind continue to go forward and all of that inertia, all of that energy, was trapped in that number two, or that number one cabin car which just continued to crush and get hit and hit and hit again, and crush that car. So, just by looking at this, it's good evidence of the fact that the safer -- towards the rear. The rear train has some fatalities associated with it in the event of an accident or collision, and we've had fatalities in the rear car. So, statistically speaking, probably the second car from the end would be the most, would be the safest place to be. TAPPER: When you get on a train is there anything you do in case of a worst-case scenario? Do you sit a certain way? Do you sit in a certain car? Is there anything people should know going forward? SOUCIE: I do. I sit in aft-facing seats. And most of the seats that on the trains that I ride, you can actually flip them around the other direction. If I'm facing forward, I can turn it around, face it in the aft direction. That's just better during, if there was an impact or if there was a derailment, you're forced back into your seat and thereby you would stay in that seat as opposed to being facing forward where you can become a projectile. So, when I ride trains, that's what I do. TAPPER: All right. David, thank you so much. SOUCIE: Thank you, Jake. TAPPER: There was a lot to learn about the man who was operating that Amtrak train. What this engineer is and is not volunteering to investigators as he learn how the train jumped the tracks. Plus, mixed messages from a potential presidential candidate, could it be a sign of a very long race for the White House in 2016? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) TAPPER: Welcome back to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper, with continuing coverage on his horrific story the Amtrak crash in Philadelphia. Now that we know this train was barreling towards a 50 mile-an-hour curve at more than 100 miles per hour, more questions are being asked, of course, about the man at the controls, the engineer. It is still far from definitive that he is responsible for this crash. But he certainly should have a really good idea of what happened, even though his lawyer is claiming he does not remember the crash at all. CNN's Drew Griffin is in Philadelphia right now, digging deeper on that part of the story. Drew, the engineer has not yet spoken to investigators. DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: That right, Jake, and until he does, because he was the sole driver of this train, we're never going to have a clear picture",0.52534340311217,2015-05-14
145696,256793,CNN,CNN Live At Daybreak,"CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: In case the weapons inspections do fail, the United States is also consulting with its allies about a possible war with Iraq. One key ally in the region, as I just said, is Turkey. CNN's Jane Arraf is in Ankara with the latest on talks there. And we're getting so many conflicting reports about what exactly is up there -- Jane. JANE ARRAF, CNN BAGHDAD BUREAU CHIEF: Well, Carol, the bottom line, really, is that in these talks with Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, who has just left a few hours ago back to the U.S., eventually Turkey indicated that it is on board. And according to the Americans, that was really surprising somewhat and very pleasant news. Now, this is a new Turkish government with Islamic roots, and there had been some question as to how they would respond to all of this. But they seem to have responded, in terms of the American point of view, very, very well. Now, Wolfowitz, before he left, spoke to a small group of reporters, and essentially indicated that Turkey could be one of the United States new best friends in this region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAUL WOLFOWITZ, DEPUTY DEFENSE SECRETARY: The attitude that we encountered was very encouraging, not surprising actually, but very encouraging that we find this new government is even more committed, if anything, than the last government to the idea of the Turkish-U.S. partnership and alliance, that they have said they will be with us in very clear and strong terms. (END VIDEO CLIP) ARRAF: Now, where this confusion comes from is exactly what support Turkey is going to give to the United States, and that's still a sensitive issue. The bottom line is they appear to have agreed in principle to allow use of their air bases as a start, those bases for use for any U.N. authorized attack on Iraq. Now, they have to play that pretty diplomatically, since this is a majority Muslim country, but the bottom line, again, is that the U.S. seems to have succeeded in making this part of this foundation of a coalition that it is trying to build against Iraq.

It goes to show how familiar she was with the area as well and knowing that there was no cell service available to stop short where she still had self-service just to be able to text good night to her mom. It is incredible. And who would have thought that that would be the last communication that until now anyone would have with her.

But it's clear that that model had the headway on this one. We already have plans on transferring our models to a brand-new supercomputer, the IBM iDataPlex. That will allow us to start running our models at higher resolution and our data assimilation systems at higher resolution. And we know that this is a main issue with our models compared to the European Center. But even with this new computer, we will not be up to the resolution that they run their models. BLITZER: Have you seen some major changes in the past few hours as far as the movement of this storm or storms, as we probably should call it? UCCELLINI: Actually, the storm is following a track and the development that we predicted a number of days ago, as Chad pointed to. And it's developing according to script. It's going through a very intense phase, developing phase now. We expect it to be turning slightly to the right to put it in a position just off the southeast New England coast, which is a very dangerous spot for New England, very heavy snowfall and very strong winds. The other thing I would like to note is that the waves immediately along the coast... BLITZER: The surge? UCCELLINI: No, the waves themselves could be approaching 15 to 20 feet along the coast and just off the coast we're predicting wave heights greater than 30 feet. So nobody wants to be out in that water with this storm. BLITZER: I hope so. Chad, you have another question? MYERS: I have more of a statement. I just want to say how thankful the meteorologist community in America is that you are now our new director, such a distinguished career at NCEP. We are happy to have you and congratulations, a well-deserved promotion. UCCELLINI: Well, thank you very much, Chad. BLITZER: And you're going to stay with us, because we have more questions and especially some practical questions about the dangers out there.

The first one in this new Congress dealing with the ex- president Bill Clinton and, of course, the pardon of the controversial Marc Rich. KAGAN: It should be interesting. Bob Franken on Capitol Hill, we'll see you a little bit later on; thanks. LEON HARRIS, CNN ANCHOR: Let's stay in Washington to get a closer look at, now, at the pardon process. Let's go now to CNN justice correspondent Kelli Arena. Kelli, walk us through the actual process of getting a pardon processed. KELLI ARENA, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Leon, I spoke with a former pardon attorney yesterday and she explained it to me. It is a process that -- it is quite long; it can take as many as two years to get a pardon approved. First you fill out a pardon application; you do not need a lawyer to do that. Once you do that, you submit it with the Justice Department. Some people do make the mistake of sending it to the White House, as the president does grant pardons; but the proper place is to send it to pardon attorney's office here at the Justice Department. That, then, is forwarded to the FBI for a background check to make sure that there hasn't been anything unusual, that your actions since you served your time and were released from prison -- then the prosecuting attorney's office that -- the office that you were prosecuted in is informed. They are sent the pardon application; they get to weigh in on whether or not there were any problems or questions that they had, any issues that remain open concerning the applicant. That is then sent back to the pardon attorney, who has to write an opinion and basically say, this person is eligible under our guidelines for pardon; we vote yeah or nay. That is sent to the White House counsel's office. And, of course, the question here is why so many people -- as many as 30, at least, totally skipped over Justice and went directly to the White House and were granted pardons -- Leon. HARRIS: And are you hearing from Justice Department officials there that they have any particular concerns right now with the Marc Rich pardon, which is going to be the topic of the Dan Burton's hearings in just a few moments, and we'll be dipping into. What are they saying about the hurdles that may have been circumvented in that case? ARENA: Well, Leon, we've actually heard two sides; the negative side being that this was -- these were pardons that did not go through the process, that could have alerted the president to potential",0.1915881576173197,2001-02-08

The reason why people think it's going to -- economists think it's going to in fact, diminish the impact on inflation is because it's reducing cost for ordinary people, reducing costs for ordinary people. So I think it's -- but in the meantime, in order to get that up and running, and we don't have a single Republican willing to support it yet, in order to get that up and running, it's going to be focused all on the downside. The downside is, prices have gone up because of supply chain concerns. We've worked hard on the supply chain concerns. I think you're going to see -- you've already begun to see and you're going to see over the next couple of months, oil prices, gas prices at gas pump come down. You know, the biggest -- one of the -- a third of the increase in inflation is used automobiles. So, I mean, it is a real problem, but the point is that has to do with supply chains as well, but it also has to do with the fact that not everybody is looking for a used automobile, but those who are, they're paying higher prices because there's few of them because of COVID and what was sold out and the like. So, I think it's -- it really is -- it's a real bump in the road and does affect families. When you walk in the grocery store and you're paying more for whatever you're purchasing, it matters. It matters to people. When you're paying more for gas, although, in some states, we've got the price down below 3 bucks a gallon.

I'm going to be talking to them again in a week, and I think if you look at what most people are saying, most of the economists are saying, this Build Back Better bill is not going to increase inflation. It will diminish inflation. It has a negative impact on inflation, not a -- it doesn't raise inflation. But that's hard for people to think about right now. Because Inflation is up and there's a direct correlation in most people's minds, but why is there inflation? Well, government is spending money. Well, that's not the reason for the inflation.

Starting a few weeks ago, it's been hitting record high after record high. Today it was the S&P; 500's turn to make history. Look at the S&P; 500. It broke through that 1565 level, the all-time high set in October 2007. It hit that and it blew past it today. This is a big day, because it is the last day of the first quarter.

RIPLEY: It depends on how you look at it because we have seen so many images of missile launches prior to the Singapore Summit, but North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has not launched a missile or conducted a nuclear test since last November. Now, the agreement that he signed with President Trump right there in Singapore talked about working towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But we've said time and time again there is no timeline, no specifics, no demands for North Korea to be fully transparent in terms of where their facilities are, how many warheads they have, how many missiles they have. And so as of right now, one would expect that North Korea would continue to produce weapons because it's business as usual until they make an agreement with the United States to do something differently. And just imagine the massive size of North Korea's defense industry when you look at its entire economy, which is relatively small. That is so many jobs, so much money invested and so many people who are working. Imagine a country like the United States being told that you have to basically dismantle a huge portion of your defense industry and layoff all those people in a matter of months. It's simply not feasible. So until North Korea has some sort of signed agreement, these people are going to keep working. But what's crucial here is that we're not seeing this. We're not seeing missiles being launched, not seeing the kind of provocative behavior that has frightened the international community and it pushed North Korea into this kind of corner in the first place.

Let's check our top stories for you. U.S. officials say North Korea attempted to fire a missile from its Eastern Coast Friday, but the launch failed. South Korean media report the attempt involved an intermediate range missile. A weapon like that could reach the Island of Guam, where the U.S. has military bases. Secretary of State John Kerry says the U.S. could have shot down that Russian warplane that buzzed a navy Destroyer in the Baltic Sea. One of the jets came within about 23 meters of the USS Donald Cook on Tuesday. Russia says it acted in accordance with international rules. Verbal fireworks at the CNN democratic presidential debate in New York ahead of next Tuesday's primary there. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders attacking each other over Wall Street, gun control, and their qualifications. Their race had been relatively tame until now. So, were the claims made in the New York democratic debate fact or fiction? As always, our Tom Foreman calls out the nominees truths, half-truths, and flat-out fabrications in CNN's reality check.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An impeccable political pedigree, her father was Indonesia's first president, Sukarno, driven from office by military man Suharto. She rose to prominence under Suharto's iron rule, using a quiet defiance that defined her career and became a point of criticism. Indonesia's separatists violence, plummeting economy and Suharto's attempts to oust Megawati as party leader were all factors triggering riots that became the catalyst for his downfall. Her immense popular support should have made Mrs. Megawati a shoo-in for the presidency during the 1999 elections, but her aloof attitude toward politics, refusing to cut deals and shying away from public statements gave the presidency to Mr. Wahid. Her revenge: learning to negotiate and turning Mr. Wahid's allies into foes. But her new friends may soon call in their political debts. There are other worries other than a brief stint as vice president and managing a political party, she has no experience in government. Aides say that a president who relies on professional advisers is a much needed change after 20 turbulent months of a headstrong president convinced of his own ideas. FRANS SEDA, MEGAWATI AIDE: She has the guts to take position. She has the guts to listen and to ask advice so that's enough. I mean she is a party leader - she knows. If you have - if you can lead a party, in principle, you can lead a nation. SHUBERT: A landslide victory, a moment of glory, but how long will it last? (on camera): Mrs. Megawati's advisers admit the honeymoon will be short as political partners start making demands and the public demanding solutions to the country's large sack of problems. It's up to Mrs. Megawati now to convince lawmakers and the public they've made the right choice. Atika Shubert, CNN, Jakarta.

We do have new breaking information just into CNN on the gunman, the man who opened fire overnight at the Borderline Bar and Grill in southern California. Let's go to our colleague, Shimon Prokupecz, who has more. What do we know at this time? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, so, Poppy, at this point we're not naming the suspect. We're not identifying him by name. But we've learned a lot about him and certainly law enforcement now knows a lot about him. We're told that he's 29 years old. And, obviously, there were some difficulty this morning for law enforcement in trying to identify him because we're told he did not have any identification on him. He had no other information, nor any other real way that law enforcement could identify him. They took his fingerprints. They also traced the weapon that he had. They used other methods to try and identify him. And they now believe that they have identified him and that he's 29 years old. Obviously, this is important for law enforcement so they can start building out a motive here, going through his social media, talking to his family, friends, people he worked with. So that's what's going on right now, certainly, in this investigation for law enforcement. Motive here still unknown and a key part, obviously, of this investigation that law enforcement is now working on. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Shimon Prokupecz, we know you're going to stay on top of it. We're joined now by CNN law enforcement analyst Josh Campbell, James Gagliano, both of them former FBI agents. Josh, if I could begin with you. The sheriff's deputy, he went in there. He went into the line of fire. He lost his life as a result of it. That is, isn't it, relatively new or recent guidance in terms of mass shootings, isn't it, not to sort of set up a security cordon, et cetera, but to go in and go in quickly, is that right? JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: That's right. You go to the sound of the gunfire. And it looks like he did just that. You know, that's textbook. The officer showed up. It was an incredible response time that we saw here, just within a matter of minutes from the first 911 call that was coming in, until the officers actually arrived. It was a sheriff's deputy and an officer with the California Highway Patrol. Obviously went in, were engaged by gunfire. The sergeant, you know, unfortunately, tragically losing his life. We're told that his partner, who was with the California Highway Patrol, attempted to, you know, drag him out into a position of safety.

Well, I guess the one that, you know, created most waves of disagreement was Bush versus Gore. OK. That comes up all the time and my usual response is, ""Get over it."" MORGAN: Get over the possible corruption of the American presidents. Justice Scalia. SCALIA: Look at I -- my court didn't bring the case into the court. It was brought into the courts by Al Gore. He is the one who wanted courts to decide the question and when Richard Nixon thought that he had lost the election because of chicanery in Chicago, he chose not to bring it into the courts. But I'll go one of the courts who decided, so the only question in Bush versus Gore was whether the presidency would be decided by the Florida Supreme Court or by the United States Supreme Court. That was the only question, and that's not a hard one. MORGAN: No regrets? SCALIA: Oh no regrets at all, especially since it's clear that the thing would have ended up the same way anyway the press did extensive research into what would have happened if what Al Gore wanted done had been done county by county, and he would have lost anyway.

We think Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Franklin Roosevelt are better. And, you know, what fools we are? HABERMAN: But it isn't that. His approval rating is at 36 percent.

The Danish star did it the hard way as she was 5-2 up in the first set tiebreak only to throw it away. Kuznetsova won this title in 2004. She was 4-1 up in the second set, but Wozniacki fought back brilliantly to win 7-5. After that, it was easy, but by the time Wozniacki took the decisive set by six games to one, they'd been on court for three hours. It was Labor Day in the U.S. on Monday, and a great day for sports entertainment. The final round of the Deutche Bank championship in Boston, Massachusetts was a thriller needing a playoff to produce a winner. It was a star studded field,but two relative unknowns were the last men standing. This is Chez Reavie at the 13 sinking one of his six birdies in a round of 66, but Webb Simpson was hot on his trail. Simpson won his first PGA tour event only two weeks ago. And he was two behind on the 18th. But that birdie changed everything. That put the pressure on Reavie who needed only a par at the last for the title, but it wasn't to be. His putt was just off meaning he and Simpson had to go into a playoff. Now you always tend to back the player that's come from behind in these situations, but Simpson was in trouble if they played the 18th again. He needed to make this tricky birdie to stay in contention and he did. Great news for his wife, not so much for the little baby. One day his kid will dine out on that story. Simpson is already dining out on what happened next, playing the 18th again, he birdied it for the third time in less than an hour to clinch the Deutsche Bank Championship. What an incredible win.

IF you're -- if you have a plan to get there, as he said, our alliance needs you to accelerate it. And if you don't yet have a plan, these are my words, not his, get one. It is time for actions, not words. And let me thank specifically the secretary general for your outspoken leadership on this issue. As you and I discussed privately and you've discussed with the president, the world needs NATO's strength and leadership now more than ever before. And we are grateful, Mr. Secretary General, that you join us in calling for immediate and steady progress on all of our NATO allies' commitment to our common defense. The truth is, the rise of adversaries new and old demands a strong response from this alliance. In the east, NATO has embarked on improvement in its deterrent posture by stationing four combat-read multinational battalions in Poland and the Baltic states. And as I assured the secretary general in our meeting today, in the wake of Russian efforts to redraw international borders by force, the United States will continue its leadership role in the enhanced forward presence initiative and other critical joint actions. With regard to Ukraine, as I said before, our alliance will continue to hold Russia accountable and demand that they honor the Minsk Agreements, beginning with de-escalating violence in eastern Ukraine. For the sake of peace and for the sake of innocent human lives, we urge both sides to abide by the cease-fire that began today and we pray for peace in Ukraine. Be assured, the United States as well will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which President Trump firmly believes can be found. As I said in Munich, though, NATO's continued leadership is also necessary in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism. This, another item that as a candidate for office, President Trump first raised. As a candidate a year ago, he called on NATO to evolve by expanding counterterrorism operations and we're encouraged to see under your leadership, NATO is in the process of doing just that. It's hard to speak of these issues in the abstract, as I stand here in Brussels. Just -- now almost a year ago, and that three horrific suicide bombings occurred, 33 innocent victims, including four Americans, hundreds more injured.

They're concerned about what they say is a spread of Islamic fundamentalism on the streets of Britain. They've been spurred on very much by that terrible killing of Lee Rigby, the British soldier in southeast London. And what they're demanding is for the British government to take action now. What are you defending England against? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our own culture, because they're coming over here and they're... UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're defending terrorists. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have to stop offending people. It's our own country. CHANCE: Critics of this organization say it's merely a front for racism. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not racism, because I've got black friends, I've got Muslim friends. I'm here to defend my country, because (inaudible) got killed the other day. He got killed for no reason? Well, because the Muslim terrorists. CHANCE: Well, across the political divide, there is this counter- demonstration that's been organized by a collection of anti-fascist groups. They're very angry that the EDL has been given permission at all to protest on the streets of the British capital. They're concerned that the English Defense League is capitalizing on the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby and trying to divide Britain. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There will be no (inaudible) There will be no Hitlers, there will be no more Mussolinis, because we'll stand up against you. And we will never surrender. We'll fight you and any (inaudible) stand against us. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do not want extreme Islam in our country. I mean, it took last Wednesday, it took 90 dead in 7/7. It took countless attacks, no go areas in Bolton, (inaudible), you name it, up north it happens. And we're out to stop that. If we cannot walk free in our own streets in our own country, then in that case call me fascist, call me racist. All I am is trying to defend my people like they would defend me. CHANCE: There you have it, in the aftermath of the killing of that British soldier on the streets of southeast London, emotions running extremely high indeed across the political divide. And of course it's the British police that are standing in between the two sides. Matthew Chance, CNN, in central London.

In a broader perspective, what I think is also interesting is, is how now identity politics is -- is becoming -- is becoming a much, much bigger issue within our political landscape. As the -- as our electorate becomes more diverse, then varying groups are getting more and more power and engaging in broader and broader conversations. And so the fact that Univision could have, as a -- could have a debate focusing specifically on Latino issues, I think is incredibly, incredibly enlightening and very interesting, and, again, in this modern political landscape. LAURA FLANDERS, AIR AMERICA: Yes, but let's talk about the politicization question. I mean I really wish that Lou was here, because he knows where I stand on this. And I agree with Hillary.

PILGRIM: The position of this broadcast has never linked these things. (CROSSTALK) FLANDERS: Numbers on disease? PILGRIM: The fact is that illegal immigration is always the focus of the discussion. FLANDERS: There's an element of racism... PILGRIM: And legitimate immigration... FLANDERS: ...in the discussion. She's utterly right. PILGRIM: We have to take issue with you. Anyone else like to jump in here? BOYLES: Well, no, it's a ridiculous thing we just heard from our colleague. She says nothing, but just throws charges of vigilantism. That's nonsense. FLANDERS: We have -- the policy of this country... BOYLES: Take that to Air America, where it belongs. FLANDERS: ...has green-lighted the vigilantes of the Minutemen, you name it. BOYLES: What vigilantes? FLANDERS: And the language that you hear on this program... BOYLES: Wait a minute... FLANDERS: ...and others. Hillary is not wrong. BOYLES: What? FLANDERS: It is inflaming the situation... BOYLES: What have the Minutemen done? (CROSSTALK) LEON: Hillary is... (CROSSTALK) BOYLES: What have the Minutemen done? (CROSSTALK) FLANDERS: ...live in fear. PILGRIM: Wilmer, go ahead. LEON: Hillary -- on this issue, Hillary is pandering again. The question... BOYLES: Of course. LEON: ...the premise of the question was flawed. The issue on this show, as many times as I have been on it, has never been anti- immigrant. BOYLES: No. LEON: It has been illegal immigration. So for Hillary to go along that line of reasoning was just flat out wrong.

This comes down from a high of about 30 hospitals that were closed with the peak. About 13 dialysis units are closed, but there's capacity to accommodate all of the patients in the Southeastern Texas area. Twenty-six nursing homes remain closed, but again, the capacity has been able to handle patients who were moved from those nursing homes. HHS itself has had about over 5,000 patient encounters since the beginning of the -- of the storm there, and the vast majority of those unrelated to the storm itself, but needing to have attention and mostly minor health activities. CDC is working with the state to work on a mitigation plan for mosquitos and the vector and that is ongoing and will continue for days and weeks. Turning to Irma, in terms of the Virgin Islands, St. Thomas Hospital, the main hospital on St. Thomas has -- is closing. The critical patients have been evacuated already and the remainder of those patients will be evacuated today, either to St. Croix or to Puerto Rico. In terms of Florida, this -- as Brock said, this remains a remarkably dangerous storm, and the window to get yourself in the right spot for weathering the storm, either evacuating or weathering the storm is closing rapidly. Health and Human Services and others along with FEMA's direction have pre-deployed a number of individuals either in Atlanta or Southern Georgia as well as in Dallas, preparation for moving into Florida as the need arises and as the local individuals in the state request. We have extended waivers so that medications can be provided for a longer period of time through pharmacies and I would encourage individuals to take an advantage of that.

So there is -- there is something going on where people are looking for answers. I think we can give them some of those answers in a good tax bill. BLITZER: You're a, you know, a fiscal conservative, but the Congressional Budget Office, as you know, they just released their report, estimating that this revised Republican tax reform bill would actually raise the deficit, the national debt by $1.7 trillion over ten years. Senator, are you comfortable with that? BLUNT: Well, first of all, the revised bill is not what the final bill will be. And secondly, most of these groups that evaluate -- want to evaluate with a score that indicates a tax policy has no impact on economic decision-making, I'm sure that at the $1 trillion or $1.5 trillion level over ten, that good tax policy, just a little bit of growth in the annual growth of the economy quickly makes up for that. And every economist I'm talking to tells me that's what's going to happen if we'll stick to the main points in this bill. We're going to have not only more take-home pay now for working families, but we're clearly going to have better jobs as this bill would encourage capital to get off the sidelines and back into the economy. BLITZER: You're one of the leaders of the Republicans in the Senate. Are you ready to commit right now, Senator, that whatever tax bill emerges from the House, the Senate -- joint House/Senate conference committee, the final -- the final bill, you will give it enough time before a final vote that the Congressional Budget Office could score it, as they say, and tell the American people how large of a deficit it would create? Because you're clearly not going to be able to pay for all of the tax cuts you want to implement. BLUNT: Well, think the critical thing is to get a bill passed this year. And I've watched the Congressional Budget Office for a long time. They are never right. So waiting for them to see later just how wrong they are never makes much sense to me. So no, I wouldn't commit to that. You're going to have a score, and there's going to be some argument about it. You're going to see some significant dynamic scoring. I was with Larry Lindsey today, who was one of president a's economic advisers. I've never seen him more excited about the opportunity in a tax package than he was today. And usually I see him as a guy who's on the sort of the downside of always looking for the worst thing that can happen. He and every other economist thinks this is headed in the right direction.

ROCHELLE WALENSKY, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: Data from this investigation will likely provide some of the earliest looks in this country on the transmissibility of the variant. FIELD: So far, Omicron cases are generally described as mild. Peter McGinn, the first confirmed case of Omicron in the U.S., was vaccinated and boosted. PETER MCGINN, HEALTH CARE WORKER INFECTED WITH OMICRON VARIANT: Light fatigue, a runny nose and sore throat. After a day, those symptoms went away. FIELD: The delta variant still accounts for virtually all cases in the U.S. now seeing surges in parts of the Midwest and Northeast. Michigan, New Hampshire and Maine all hitting record high hospitalizations. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I really wanted to get the booster. A little stressful, especially with the holidays and stuff coming up. (END VIDEOTAPE) FIELD: And, Jake, while we're starting to see how the vaccines are holding up against Omicron, there are more questions that still need to be answered about Omicron like whether or not this variant is more transmissible. We could be getting closer to an answer there. The World Health Organization saying that there are studies going on in the UK and in southern African countries right now and they are expected to release some of the data from those studies on Friday -- Jake. TAPPER: All right. Alexandra Field, thanks so much. Joining us now to discuss, CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, right now, only about a quarter of the fully vaccinated population has received a booster shot. And no state can claim more than half of its vaccinated population has gotten the booster. Are we in trouble as we head into the holidays? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know how to handle this, Jake, now, with what we've learned over the last two years. The largest problem is still the unvaccinated in terms of potential trouble, in terms of severe illness and in terms of hospitals potentially becoming overwhelmed. If you look at boosters, it's interesting and look at the willingness to get boosters, around a quarter of people have received their boosters. What we've seen with Omicron, though, is there's definitely been a shift in terms of willingness to get it. You can see definitely will, 37 percent. A lot of reports of being challenging to get boosters right now because there's a lot of people wanting them at the same time. It's only about 18 percent of the bottom of that that says probably will not or definitely will not. So there is -- the boosters are available. People should get them now, if they are thinking about it, which a lot of people are.

HARLOW: In 20, 25 minutes. DE BLASIO: Correct. That's all it took to go from one world to another, effectively. And I've often talked about the tale of two cities.

HARLOW: And to those who say, Mr. Mayor, that sounds two socialist. Capitalism, not perfect. America, not perfect economically, but the best example there is in a world. What do you say to them?

Pope Francis shut back at bishops stating quote ""a faith that does not know how to grow roots into the lives of people stays barren. And instead of an oasis, it creates more deserts."" CNN religious commentator and host of the Sunday mass Father Edward Beck joining me now. Good to see you now, Father. So your reaction to this summit? FR. EDWARD BECK, CNN RELIGIOUS COMMENTATOR: Well, I think the headline is that for divorce and remarried, they're going to be able to use the internal forum to decide where they proceed as far as church involvement. That means that they talk to their pastor or priest and use their individual conscience as to what their state is. Now, this is kind of remarkable that it made it to the document. It was the most contested paragraph. So out of 265 bishops gathered, you need a two-thirds vote which means 177. It got 178. So it passed by one vote which means that most didn't want any change at all with regard to divorce and remarried receiving communion but this did pass. Now Fred, it's important to note that Pope Francis can do whatever he wants with this. He has now time to put together his own document. His only consultative and then we'll see if he takes it further and leaves it as it is. We know he's a Pope of surprises so we don't know where he may yet take this. WHITFIELD: So under his direction, however, do you consider this, you know, quite the victory I suppose, that either has been his message conveyed, there has been sort of an acknowledgement or a willingness to discuss further evolution? BECK: You know, Fred, it's a compromise victory, because the more liberal bishops would have wanted the document to actually say if someone is divorced and remarried without an annulment they can still receive communion and we'll work toward getting them fully regulated in the church. This document doesn't say that. It says an individual case-by-case, come to talk to your pastor or priest and see what your situation is, acknowledging that each situation is different. So note, though, the document from the synod does not communication communion at all. Interestingly, it probably wouldn't have passed if it had put communion or Eucharist in the paragraph. It just says each couple has to deal individually with their situation. So it's a victory for liberals in the sense that it got that far, but conservatives will say, look, it doesn't mention communion so nothing really has changed. WHITFIELD: One catholic analyst put it this way at ""the Washington Post"" saying Francis has the same problem Obama had. He promised the world, but Congress wouldn't let him deliver.

I mean, she's hosting this big state dinner for the President of China last night. Turns right around and this hour she's making a big announcement with Wal-Mart we're told by officials where she's going to announce -- a continuation of her healthy eating initiative that Wal-Mart is going to now step in. This retailing giant, obviously a lot of clout and pressure their suppliers to drastically cut sodium in their packaged foods, sugar, trans-fats, et cetera. Take a look what they're going to be announcing, first of all, that Wal-Mart will be cutting prices on fresh fruits and vegetables to try to encourage people to buy more of those. Also cutting sodium, trans- fats and sugars as I noted in some of their company branded packaged foods and all these changes will be phased-in over the next five years. I thought it only fair though, since we talked about the First Lady juggling all of these tasks to take a look at last night's state dinner to see how it measures up on this health eating. Now they did start out with a pear (ph) salad with goat cheese and then had some black walnuts which can be good for you. Lobster with carrots and mushrooms, again, really good there are some vegetables mixed in. And then, the dry-aged rib eye for protein. But buttermilk crisp onions with double stuffed potatoes, obviously veering into some dangerous territory there along with creamed spinach and topped off with apple pie and ice cream. So you know, a special occasion, obviously and we don't want to make too much light of it. And occasionally there's going to be a nice splurge of a dinner. But the First Lady has put a lot of time, a lot of energy and her name and clout behind this healthy eating initiative for all Americans but especially she's been focused on kids to get them started and get those habits started early.

And so I don't necessarily anticipate that public settings can nor should necessarily just blanket lift mask guidance. That's not actually what the CDC said. They said that if you are fully vaccinated, you don't need to wear a mask. But it doesn't mean that all the grocery stores that have no way of being able to establish whose vaccinated or not, will lift mask requirements and ignore the operational challenges. But the guidance does provide some benefit for say employers who are wondering, they've got all these vaccinated employees that are coming back to the office and do they need to make them wear masks? And the answer is no. The people that write me all the time asking, you know, I'm fully vaccinated, what can I still do? This is a very helpful signal to them that now that they are protected from vaccines. They can make the choice not to wear a mask. Some people will have a higher concern about you know; they have a lower risk tolerance and a higher concern about getting vaccinated. And they may choose to continue to our mask that's absolutely within anybody's individual, right to decide. But some people I know, because I hear from these people are many people have been hesitant to get vaccinated because they simply don't perceive vaccines to be much of a game changer, when in fact, they change everything.

Why wouldn`t you flee if you`re going to die for the crime? So what makes the difference? Why does the judge say yes for some and no for others? (START VIDEO CLIP) WAGSTAFFE: Well, this judge and this case since it`s not a death penalty case, not a California special circumstance, however, so this judge felt she was obligated to not impose no bail. She then took the approach that it`s entitled to reasonable bail. We said $100 million is where it ought to be based on the amount of money this woman and her family and friends have. That might be motivation to not want to run. The judge used her discretion and came up with the answer, I think $35 million, which is ten times the amount anybody has ever posted for bail in our county. And she felt that was enough. We don`t. We think that it needed to be far beyond that. Even if she is on house arrest with a GPS monitor, that can be easily overcome. More worry if she`ll be there when the case goes to court.

(END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: He's referring to a conversation he said he had with the president before the war in Iraq, in which the president, he suggests, was living in a dream world. Who should we believe? The White House flatly denies this, Reverend Falwell. FALWELL: Well, I don't know who to believe, but I know this, that it was certainly, I think, inappropriate for him here with two weeks to go in the election. He's my good friend, just like Jesse is, but he was wrong on that. He shouldn't have said that. And I want to take the president's word on this one. He says he didn't say it. I think there could have been a misunderstanding. I'm not calling anybody a liar. I'm simply saying that this president, talking about the terrorists and the -- how many we've lost, 1,100 soldiers, that's a terrible price. But when you consider the barbaric act we just uncovered in the last 24 hours, the Iraqi soldiers murdered, they weren't insurgents. They were barbarians who did that. You don't shoot people in the back of the head and kill people, men, women and children. And the president's doing the right thing. He's looking for them, he's searching them out. He's killing them when he finds them. And that's the only cure for barbarians. BLITZER: Reverend Jackson, I'll give you the last word. Go ahead. JACKSON: Well, Pat Robertson purports to have connections with a direct higher authority to which Mr. Bush must submit. FALWELL: So do you, Jesse. JACKSON: So, Jerry, you should not abandon your friend, Pat Robertson, for the president. I submit to you today that our going to Iraq was a misadventure. It has put America in isolation. We are losing lives, money and losing our character in that war. We deserve better leadership. And we need... FALWELL: I'd rather be killing them over there than fighting them over here, Jesse. And I think you would... JACKSON: Let's stop the killing and choose peace. Let's choose negotiation over confrontation. FALWELL: Well, I'm for that too. But you've got to kill the terrorists before the killing stops. And I'm for the president to chase them all over the world.

Vlad, the deputy minister of defense, you know, when I ask the questions, many say the military is inept, the military is corrupt. They weren't there to help. He says he thinks that is grossly unfair, but on the ground I know you're hearing a lot of frustration, aren't you? VLADIMIR DUTHIERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Erin. In fact, the report by Amnesty International dovetails very closely with what people on the ground in Chibok have told us, which is that the military security officials were not around when this attack first happened. In fact, one gentleman that we spoke to, father of two daughters who have been abducted said that the few security guards that were there actually dove into the bush with the residents of the town as the town came under attack, as the school itself was under fire. The military, the defense ministry just moments ago releasing a statement themselves saying that they don't believe the Amnesty report to be true. They say that in fact reinforcements were called during the attack and that is what Amnesty is getting wrong essentially. They said that the military received the call while the attack was in progress. They started to send reinforcements. Over 120 kilometers, which is a pretty good distance. During the movement from point A to point B to meet the attackers at the school, they say the reinforcements came under attack by some militants, and they sustained some casualties. But they categorically say that the Amnesty report is incorrect -- Erin. BURNETT: All right, thank you very much, Vlad Duthiers in Abuja. More than 2,000 people have died in the violence in Northern Nigeria this year alone, more than 300 killed by Boko Haram just this week.

2116,2217,CNN,Moneyline News Hour,"New York. VARNEY: Now, coming up on MONEYLINE, the vision that shaped an online titan. We'll tell you about the remarkable and profitable ascent of AOL. BAY: Plus, we'll ask three top analysts what today's alliance could mean for media investors. ANNOUNCER: From CNN's New York headquarters, this is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) VARNEY: More now on our top story, the new media megamerger of Time Warner and AOL. AOL shareholders will own more than half of the new behemoth, but by most measures Time Warner dwarfs AOL, in terms of sales, scope and depth of corporate history. Time and Warner, both founded in the '20s, came together in one of the most tumultuous takeover sagas of the '80s, a deal that finally closed exactly 10 years ago today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (voice-over): Time Warner, through its movies, cable, music and publishing businesses, employs nearly 70,000 people. It pulled in revenues over the past four quarters of $17.7 billion, an income of $1.2 billion. America Online, formed in the mid-'80s under a different name, launching what we know as AOL in 1989. It employs a fraction of the workers Time Warner employs and had less than a third of the revenues in recent quarters. Income trailed Time Warner over the same period. But AOL far outshines Time Warner in one critical respect: Its market value as of Friday was nearly double Time Warner's. BAY: For more on the future of this megamerger, we've gathered three top media analysts here in our studio, including Jessica Reif Cohen of Merrill Lynch, Chris Dixon of PaineWebber and David Londoner of Schroeder. Now here we are. We've lived with this all day. We're still shaking our heads. Chris, let's start with you. Is this just a staggering validation of the power of the Internet, that an Internet company, even one with profits, can acquire the world's largest media company. CHRIS DIXON, MEDIA ANALYST, PAINEWEBBER: I think that's the case. What we're really seeing here is that the Internet is no longer just about a 28.8 world. It's going to become much more television- like. It's about streaming and it's about bandwidth, and clearly what this deal does is this new company is able to define, set the agenda, for what the Internet's going to be as it takes part in this new digital age. BAY: So of all the assets combined in this alliance, is bandwidth at the top of the list in terms of (OFF-MIKE)? DIXON: I think there's three pieces. The first piece is content, the second piece is sheer scale, and the final piece is connectivity, the ability to connect and be program-distributed to lots of players. So it's those three pieces. And what's unique about it is these three companies fit extraordinarily well to provide that kind of size and scope and scale. DAVID LONDONER, MEDIA ANALYST, SCHROEDER: Yes, yes -- OK, we're in the same... BAY: You do, you think content -- you're in sync on this. Content",0.1364861354003885,2000-01-10

The other point that's really fascinating that really kind of underscores the muddle, the ambivalence that so many Democrats feel. You know, there's only been one Iowa caucus ever, Democratic caucus, where four candidates reached double digits. 2004 was the only time. There's never been one where five candidates reached double digits. And it's entirely possible we will see four and we could even see five, which I think is reflective of the fact that no one has fully consolidated a coalition that spans the party. BERMAN: And Astead, one of the things that you're starting to see from the Biden campaign and also national Democrats, is they are facing the very real possibility, well, what happens if Bernie Sanders does win big in Iowa? Goes back to his neighboring state of New Hampshire, wins there. Nevada he came very close in 2016, he could win there. It's not impossible. Some might even say it's perhaps likely that Bernie Sanders wins the first three contests. What then? HERNDON: For the establishment Democrats that's their nightmare scenario. For Bernie Sanders to kind of run those first three states. And they see Iowa as maybe their best shot to knock that down. And New Hampshire obviously near his home media market, he's strong. He runs well with Latino voters particularly important in Nevada. And so Iowa, where they had placed those high expectations might be the best bet. They tried to play up even the controversy this weekend where Bernie Sanders surrogate encouraged the crowd to boo Hillary Clinton and then later apologized. That's the language that you see from other candidates talking about unity. It's a subtle shot, a subtle nod to the Sanders campaign saying hey, every candidate at 20 percent does not have enough votes to win the nomination. It's going to be the candidate and the campaign that can grow that coalition. They are saying that Bernie might have the most committed group of supporters, the group of supporters that are most passionate and the highest floor but they are the campaigns that can grow above that and grow. What Bernie is also trying to do was change the electorate, which is another big question we'll see on Monday. BROWNSTEIN: The Biden campaign is making a very explicit choice here. I mean, they have chosen not to challenge Sanders very much as he has ascended. And I think the view inside the Biden campaign is precisely for the reasons that you're saying that if they can't win they would rather Sanders win here than either Buttigieg or Warren because they believe their ceiling is higher, and that Sanders to them has not yet proven he can go beyond his coalition in '16 which ultimately was too narrow to win.",0.4064522135053021,2020-02-02

Now come questions about the plane's age and record and why the pilot ignored orders not to land in thick fog. The Civil War and the confederacy making a sudden comeback this week, fueled by a state proclamation to honor them. While many are outraged, especially African-Americans, one black Civil War re-enactor stands up for his confederate pride live this hour. And this week, you heard about the airline charging for carry-on bags, right? Everyone is asking, what are they thinking? So we invited the CEO of Spirit Airlines to answer that very question for us live here tonight. We begin in western Russia, where a tragic plane crash today claimed the lives of nearly 100 top Polish officials including the president, first lady and senior military leaders. Terrorism does not appear to be a factor. Weather does. And Russian and Polish authorities say the Polish military plane crash while approaching the airport in Smolensk, Russia in heavy fog. The plane may have clipped some trees at the end of the runway. A delegation had gone to Russia to mark the 70th anniversary of a horrific event in World War II, the massacre of 20,000 Polish POWs in the nearby village of Katyn. The Polish ambassador to the U.S. and President Lech Kaczynski embodied the spirit of Polish independence in the post-Soviet world. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT KUPIECKI, POLISH AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: President Kaczynski represented the generation of freedom, the freedom connected permanently with the legacy of solidarity movement, which in 1989 brought about freedom, democracy and prosperity to Poland.

And 100-mile-per-hour winds over the entire island. The entire place had at least 100-mile-per-hour winds. That's the big white circle you see there. Those winds are going to affect the Dominican Republic as well later on today. A lot of rain coming in and we already have these flash flood warnings going on. Some spots could pick up 20 or 15 inches of rain. I know that's not 40 or 50 like we had in Harvey, but this is a mountainous island so this is going to run off very quickly. And then what happens?

What we've been seeing, as we expected and as we anticipated for the people of Puerto Rico, this is the most devastating storm either in a century or quite frankly in modern history. So critical right now is for people to recognize that the brunt of the storm is still to come. There's a lot of flooding. There's a lot of infrastructure damage, but the only thing that should matter right now is that people stay safe, that we can lives, and they we will start the rebuilding process.

So how does this compare to other hurricanes you have seen and Irma? ROSSELLO: There's no comparison, really. Luckily For Irma we were very prepared.

Sources tell CNN that terrorists nearly attacked the U.S. Embassy. CNN State Department correspondent Andrea Koppel joins us with details on the situation in Yemen -- Andrea. ANDREA KOPPEL, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: Donna, in the last number of weeks, the number of threats against American interests in Yemen have been on the rise. Yemen, if everyone remembers, is a small, very poor Arab state on the southwestern corner of the Arab peninsula. It's also the site of the USS Cole bombing last year. Now in recent days, administration sources tell CNN there was a credible threat, and not only credible threat, but a near close attack against the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. For that reason, a number of FBI personnel who were there have been asked to return, according to sources. We narrowly dodged a secret attack, said one. The threat was imminent, specific, and credible. Those FBI officials close their office on Sunday and return to the United States. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD BOUCHER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: The FBI made a decision based -- to leave Yemen based on what they saw as a credible threat to their employees. They made the decision to withdraw their personnel from Yemen on June 17th. Although our embassy is closed to the public, our embassy does remain open and our diplomats continue to do their jobs. (END VIDEO CLIP) KOPPEL: Now, U.S. officials say they have every reason to believe that the investigation into the USS Cole bombing last October will accelerate at some point in the very near future. In the meantime, Donna, the group that U.S. officials believed was responsible for planning this attack has been arrested, officials saying that they found hand grenades, among them. But not sure if this group is homegrown, that is based in Yemen, or if in fact it came from other places, perhaps even Afghanistan. The investigation is continuing -- Donna.

In Sondland's version, he says, ""I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage investigation into the Biden's."" But as I was saying, Vindman's statement echoes what others have said including Dr. Fiona Hill in what she told the committee. Now, she is a former top Russia expert in the White House. She stepped down in July. She was also in that July 10th meeting, and she testified that Ambassador Sondland brought up the investigations as well. And then there's Ambassador Bill Taylor. He is the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine still now, and he said that he was told the same thing about the meeting. Now, in Vindman's statement, he goes on to say Ambassador Sondland started to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President, at which time Ambassador Bolton -- that's the former National Security adviser, John Bolton -- he cut the meeting short. Dr. Fiona Hill, then enter the room and asserted to Ambassador Sondland that his statements were inappropriate. Again, Sondland's version is, ""If Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill or others harbored any misgivings about the propriety of what we were doing, they never shared those misgivings with me, then or later.""

QUEST: How worried are you that after Brexit, for example, the U.K. is going to become somewhat -- not divorced, but -- there will be a divorce, but will be sidelined in terms of information crossover with European counterparts. WAINWRIGHT: Well, we understand in the policing community in Europe, we've built up years of an integrated network. Policing network to fight the highest terrorist threat we have seen for 20 years. So, we can't afford to have a major partner dislocated from that. We've got to get it right, Richard. That's the message I think. There are many important legal issues, not legal issues to deal with. There's a whole dollop of politics all over this. But in the end, the imperative which I think the grownups in the room understand, is that the collective security interest of Europe. We've got to get a deal. QUEST: Want to talk finally about the issue of money laundering. Because it's all related in some shape or form. It's criminals doing things they obviously -- they shouldn't be. But money laundering. All governments have been putting in place vast anti-money laundering rules and regulations. And you basically think most of these rules are pretty useless. WAINWRIGHT: I don't think they work",0.1973851900681169,2017-09-21
297665,491989,CNN,Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics,"members of the House, answering questions primarily about Iraq and also about Afghanistan. Now, we want to turn back to the story we are following today on Capitol Hill, and that is the president's judicial nominees -- nominees to the federal courts of appeals. There has been an effort to come up with a compromise between Republicans and Democrats. So far, that has not resulted in success, but right now we want to talk to one of those who's been involved in trying to reach an agreement. He is Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska. Senator, thank you very much for joining us. SEN. BEN NELSON (D), NEBRASKA: Thank you, Judy. WOODRUFF: Senator, where does everything stand? Now that they are debating on the floor of the Senate, the nomination of Judge Priscilla Owen, that would seem to suggest that efforts to work out a deal have failed? NELSON: No, I don't think so at all. I think the efforts are ongoing, even as we speak, at the moment. I've stepped out of a meeting so that we could give you an update. We continue to talk, to dialogue, also to wordsmith, to try to find areas of agreement. I can't tell you we're real close, but I can tell you we continue to get closer with every discussion. WOODRUFF: But, now that Judge Owen is before the Senate, aren't you inevitably going to face -- I mean, she's going to be filibustered by the Democrats. There's going to be a call for a so-called cloture vote to stop the debate, to stop the filibuster, and at that point, aren't you facing the so-called nuclear option, changing the rules by the Republicans? NELSON: Well, that could happen, but I don't know that that will happen. I think that the whole effort on getting an agreement is to get up or down votes wherever possible. And that's certainly going to be the commitment with respect to the previous judges as well as new judges, and that's what the agreement is all about, to try to find a way to get more up-or-down votes, except in extraordinary circumstances, and I'm not sure that for enough individuals, she would constitute an extraordinary circumstance for -- to vote for the filibuster to vote against cloture. There probably will be quite a few votes against her, but that's different than the filibuster. WOODRUFF: Has -- have enough Republicans now agreed that they're willing to let some of these judges go by the wayside, some of the seven who have been proposed? NELSON: Well, I don't know that anybody is going to go by the wayside. There may be some names that don't come forward. There may be names that don't come out of the committee. I think those are all decisions that are going to be made by others. But I don't know that there's a belief here that anybody's going to go by the wayside. There just may be some that aren't brought forward. I",0.0469840246435991,2005-05-18
156569,277635,CNN,American Morning,"PAULA ZAHN, CNN ANCHOR: He defied Saddam Hussein and lives to tell the story. Hussain Al-Shahristani was a leading Iraqi scientist when he refused the Iraqi president's request to build nuclear weapons. That was in 1979. As a result, he was tortured, and spent nearly 12 years in prison before escaping. Now, he works with Iraq's opposition, and says Saddam does have chemical and biological weapons. I had the chance to talk with him yesterday, and I asked him where the nerve agents are being stored, and what Saddam plans to do with them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HUSSAIN AL-SHAHRISTANI, NUCLEAR SCIENTIST: He has a very elaborate concealment system with more than 2,000 special security officers trained to move these around, hide them deep underground, build a tunnel system and thereby guard it, which he has been using in the past to move about the city and also to store some of these. ZAHN: How extensive is the tunnel system? AL-SHAHRISTANI: The reports we keep hearing from inside Iraq that he has in the last decade expanded them to a multilayer system connecting his presidential palaces, security headquarters, command centers, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) store them and so on. So, I estimate it's a few tens of kilometers of tunnels under Baghdad. ZAHN: Now, we know you got out of the country in '91. At that time, did you see evidence of this tunnel system? AL-SHAHRISTANI: No, as a matter of fact, I was in jail until 1991, so I personally didn't have a chance to see any of these tunnels. But recently, I have spoken to people who have been working in these tunnels, and specifically on weapons of mass destruction. ZAHN: Let's talk a little bit more about these tunnels. Are you being told by your contacts in Iraq that that is where some of this weaponry now is being stored, areas that inspectors can't get to? AL-SHAHRISTANI: Well, so far, they have not been to them, and it's to me surprising that the inspectors have not found their way to the tunnel system yet. ZAHN: And why do you think they haven't found this tunnel system? AL-SHAHRISTANI: Well, Saddam has been concealing these. Most people who have known about these in the past have been taken out by the regime, and they are not to be found anymore. And the only people who actually use the tunnel system are his most trusted security officers. So, there's very, very small information about these tunnels, and I presume it has not been communicated to the inspectors by the intelligence agencies yet. ZAHN: It is your belief that Saddam Hussein has a plan, a significant plan in the works to create what you would call a chemical belt? AL-SHAHRISTANI: There was a report from the resistance groups inside Iraq that Saddam has considered sitting up a chemical belt around Baghdad, entrapping about four million residents in the city and use them as a human shield to fight his street battles. This is what I have",0.0326222257534827,2003-02-28
1330057,1644249,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"if you don't get back to the town of Donetsk by the time of curfew, they won't let you in and then you are stranded in a very bad situation with really no way to keep yourself safe. So a big part of doing this job is doing it the right job which of course means safely. They were definitely loading bodies. Whether or not they have found all the bodies is difficult to tell because it's such a potentially broad area that they have to search. Remember, Fred, you know, the plane being at 33,000 feet, falling from that altitude. They calculated it could be well over 20 kilometers of the debris field, but they were finally giving these bodies a modicum of dignity, even if they were putting them in bags and loading them on the trucks. At least they were getting them out of there. There were dogs in the area and other reasons, the temperature, et cetera, to get these bodies moved, let alone have them identified and given back to their loved ones. WHITFIELD: So, Chris, the area where you were and at least last we spoke of, because I don't know if you've now moved to a new location there was the tail of the plane in the backdrop behind you. And I wonder what is the nearest location of the next, you know, large piece of fuselage? We understand that the debris field is spread out between four and six miles. But take us on the ground there. The distance between these larger pieces of debris. CUOMO: We were -- we were in a very concentrated area. The tails there, a big section of wing there. There were a couple of other places of fuselage. There seems to be a huge portion of the cargo area, the cargo bay that burned apparently. There's a big burned field there. There is seeding in that area. I mean, there are all aspects of the aircraft. There are turbine components which obviously would come from the engine. I'm not saying that all of it is somewhere else. I'm just saying that, you know, this is about being thorough, Fred, I mean, that's why there are people who are experts in this. Because if you go and you want to make a case of international proportion, especially if it has a terroristic element you're going to have to really know what you're talking about and make it in a way that is compelling to all parties involved and to the international community. And the more the scene is corrupted and the more holes there are in the theory, the more difficult that becomes. WHITFIELD: And you're in an area where there are farms and then in some of the video that we're looking at right now, you can't see it but we can. And it showed, you know, someone who was near some luggage. Just passersby, people who live in the community are they -- are you",0.2789324515824279,2014-07-19

In what ways is Mitt Romney like an Etch a Sketch? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN FUGELSANG, COMEDIAN: Is there a concern that the pressure from Santorum and Gingrich might force the governor to tax too far to the right, it would hurt him with moderate voters in the general election? ERIC FEHRNSTROM, ROMNEY CAMPAIGN: Well, I think he hit a reset button for the fall campaign and everything changes. It`s almost like an Etch a Sketch, you can kind of shake it up and we start all over again. (END VIDEO CLIP) MADDOW: This is an Etch a Sketch. Ed has one, I have one. I was always really bad at this. Etch a Sketch is made by the Ohio Art Company. It`s an American company that`s been around since 1908. First in Archbold, Ohio, then in Bryan, Ohio. When the company was 40-something years old, in the 1950s, they were approached by a French engineer who had designed something called a ""Telecran,"" or ""L`Ecran Magique."" Ohio Art bought the ""Telecran."" They developed it. They renamed it the Etch a Sketch, and to the delight to people everywhere in the world who delight in drawing curving lines only bill virtue of great concentration and exceptional hand/eye coordination, an American toy phenomenon was born. In the late 1950s until the year 2000, Etch a Sketch was manufactured by workers in Bryan, Ohio. The workers were in a union. They were paid the grand sum of about $9 per hour to make the Etch a Sketch. That`s who made this, until the year 2000 when the Etch a Sketch company outsourced their work to China. Instead of 9 bucks an hour, the Chinese workers got paid 24 cents an hour. They had a minimum work with week of 84 hours per week. Now, that was bad, even for that part of China. And the workers there went on strike to try to get the Chinese minimum wage and specifically, to try to get more meat -- more meat, more protein in their food allotment. They lost on that and the strike organizers got fired. Confronted by this ""New York Times"" article with the facts about how their product was being made, the Etch a Sketch company basically said they felt bad about it, but they felt their hand was forced because of price pressure from their major buyers, including Toys ""R"" Us. Toys ""R"" Us, for the record, is now owned by Bain Capital. So? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Bonjour, je m`appelle Mitt Romney. (END VIDEO CLIP) MADDOW: So Mitt Romney, like an Etch a Sketch, or as it used to be called, the Telecran, Mitt Romney, like an Etch a Sketch, speaks French. Mitt Romney, like an Etch a Sketch, also has a documented history of firing American workers and sending their jobs",0.694037308461026,2012-03-21
