And they have said, look, we basically don't want any kind of legislation that could make it harder for eligible voters to cast their ballot. So, Victor, Alisyn, they didn't speak specifically to these two overhaul bills. But this is some of the stronger outspokenness that we have heard from businesses in the community. And I spoke with Representative Joaquin Castro earlier this morning. He told me that, in seeing those businesses speak out, that they think that perhaps there could be some last-minute softening at least on the legislation before it continues down the process to most likely go to the governor's desk here. Now, of course, in -- like we have seen in other states, Republicans here say the reason why they think they need this is for ballot security. But they have not really provided any sort of evidence for fraud that they are trying to prevent. BLACKWELL: And that vote just a few hours away. Dianne Gallagher for us there -- Dianne, thanks so much. So, House Republicans could vote as soon as next week on whether Congresswoman Liz Cheney will lose her leadership position. Now, sources tell CNN that allies of former President Trump are looking for possible challenges to her reelection in Wyoming. And Cheney is reiterating her firm belief that this is about more than her leadership position, that the GOP cannot be the party of Trump. This is in a new op-ed for ""The Washington Post."" CAMEROTA: Yes, and I just want to take a minute to read this op-ed, because I think that her words are so important right now. So here's what Liz Cheney writes. She says: ""While embracing or ignoring Trump's statements might seem attractive to some for fund-raising and political purposes, that approach will do profound long-term damage to our party and our country. Trump has never expressed remorse or regret for the attack of January 6, and now suggests that our elections and our legal and constitutional system cannot be trusted to do the will of the people. ""This is immensely harmful, especially as we now compete on the world stage against communist China and its claims that democracy is a failed system. We Republicans need to stand for genuinely conservative principles and steer away from the dangerous and anti-democratic Trump cult of personality. History is watching. Our children are watching."" CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger joins us. It's really a remarkable op-ed that she wrote there. GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: It is. It was kind of stunning to read it, because what she did was say, OK, I know you're going to throw me out of the leadership. That's a done deal. But I refuse to change my mind and to pay homage to Donald Trump, who I think is destroying conservatism. And what she did in that op-ed was, she kind of made the case for conservatism vs. cultism,",0.0,2021-05-06

Top members of the administration denying authorship, calling the op-ed amateur, laughable, sophomoric, deceitful and a lot more. We're told the president was reading the denials closely. They're being immediately printed out and delivered to him as they roll in. The White House may be closer to figuring out who that author was. The ""Times"" citing an outside adviser says the administration has about a dozen names on its list. BRIGGS: First Lady Melania Trump even weighing in, calling the op-ed author, quote, cowardly, claiming he or she is sabotaging the country. But she also cited the importance of a free press. Senator Rand Paul offered up this stunning idea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

I'm Kate Bolduan. ""THE LEAD WITH JAKE TAPPER"" starts now. JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. And we begin today with the health lead. This afternoon, the U.S. cross 3.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus, as the death toll now tops 137,000. Right now, there are only two states in the United States, Delaware and Maine, that are seeing a decrease in infections. Dozens of hospitals throughout the country are overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. A hotel is now being converted into a health care facility in Laredo, Texas, the situation so dire that some counties in Arizona and Texas are being compelled to bring in refrigerated trucks because the morgues there are, sadly, filling up. And yet it was only one month ago today, June 16, when Vice President Pence wrote this ""Wall Street Journal"" op-ed titled: ""There Isn't a Coronavirus Second Wave,"" the vice president boasting about case numbers in decline that have since exploded. The vice president attacking the media for -- quote -- ""fear- mongering,"" the vice president falsely claiming -- quote -- ""We have slowed the spread' and -- quote -- ""We are winning the fight against the invisible enemy."" Take a look at this graph. Does it look like winning to you? The only way one could regard this as winning is if one were the coronavirus. There are more than a million new infections since the vice president wrote that op-ed, averaging nearly double the daily cases from the previous peak in April. And, still, the cry from health care experts for an aggressive nationwide testing and contact tracing program, to say nothing of an education program for those who continue to refuse to wear a mask in public, those go ignored by President Trump. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan today the latest Republican to sound the alarm about the lack of presidential leadership, writing in a new op- ed in ""The Washington Post"" -- quote -- ""It was clear that waiting around for the president to run the nation's response was hopeless. If we in Maryland delayed any longer, we'd be condemning more of our citizens to suffering and death"" -- unquote. Now, one of the few parts of that Pence op-ed from a month ago that withstands the scrutiny of one month of time passing is the idea that we are where we are because of -- quote -- ""the leadership of President Trump."" That's true. The vice president ended that op-ed saying that their work is -- quote -- ""a cause for celebration, not the media's fear- mongering"" -- unquote. Celebration, he said. That's not just embarrassing. That's an outrage.

The president's announcement to the court was in the Rose Garden last weekend, and several more were part of the White House debate prep where Christie says masks were optional.

(END VIDEO CLIP) PAUL: There are concerns for him as well. We'll keep you posted on that. But I want to bring in emergency room physician and CNN Medical Analyst, Dr. Leana Wen. Dr. Wen, thank you so much for being with us. I want to get your most recent article in ""The Washington Post"", because we saw from you I think some very raw frustration that I haven't seen quite as deliberate as perhaps we saw here in the last 24 hours since you posted that. You wrote Saturday's briefing by President Trump's medical team was a deliberate exercise in obfuscation, insulting to the public and unbefitting the seriousness of the moment. Help us understand what you were feeling as you watched that. DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, there were so many unanswered questions in a way that it makes the sensation far more confusing and really this is a distressing time for the American people. There were key pieces of information that were missing. Every medical student, every nursing student knows that you cannot describe a patient's condition without beginning with their vital signs. Yet that was something that was even confusing. We never heard the vital signs. We got mixed messaging on whether the president was on oxygen or needed oxygen. They mentioned he was fever free but didn't mention if he was on fever reducing medications that lower his fever. And then diagnostic tests like looking at kidney function or liver function, but this is a respiratory disease. Presumably the president had some kind of respiratory involvement because he had a cough, congestion and as we later low oxygen saturation as well. But we never heard about a chest X-ray. It is not possible that the president of the United States did not get lung imaging when he had respiratory symptoms and a respiratory illness. And so, when we get information like that, where it looks like there's cherry picking of certain data to paint a certain picture, then we worry about what's being left out and why we're not being told the truth. PAUL: So, Conley did say he was extremely happy about the process that the president's made, but he warned of an inflammatory phase that sets in seven to ten days in, based on what we know about this virus.

URBAN: You know what, Jen, no matter what President Trump said, everyone would be on cable news saying he didn't go far enough, didn't say enough, didn't say -- listen, so let me ask you a question.

Romney pursued that endorsement. He welcomed it. He made a couple of birther jokes himself, nobody questions where I'm born. And so we've seen this again and again. He said all the right things during the campaign, but then he did go for the secretary of state job. He did graciously accept the endorsement in this last Senate race, which I really don't think he needed. So I don't expect much to come of this op-ed, I really don't. BURNETT: Is it all opportunistic, Scott? I mean, you know him. Is it all opportunistic now and, you know, some of the frustration that some have had with, you know, some of the retiring senators, right, is that when they'd stand up to the President and then they wouldn't and then they would and then they wouldn't, right, and it was all about what worked for them, it wasn't about taking a moral stand. Will it be different with Mitt Romney? SCOTT JENNINGS, SENIOR ADVISER TO THE ROMNEY 2012 CAMPAIGN: I think Mitt Romney will do what he's done throughout his Senate race and then today, which is to continue to say that he's going to call out the President when he engages in behavior that he disagrees with, but that he is going to continue to vote for the policies where they agree and that's frankly going to be 90 percent of the time. I mean, if you look carefully at the op-ed, he lays out all the policies that he supports and he specifically mentioned Mitch McConnell by name and says I look forward to working with Mitch McConnell and the rest of my colleagues to pass -- BURNETT: So what's he saying, Scott, I'm going to vote for every single thing the guy does but I'm going to call out his moral character? JENNINGS: Yes, that's exactly what he's going to do. I think this is going to be different than flake. At the end of flake's tenure, people want this to be another flake. Flake was actually doing what Romney said he wouldn't do, which is to cut off his nose to spite his face. I think Romney's always going to vote the way most Republicans would want a Republican senator to vote. I don't think that means he's going to hold his tongue on the behavior or the language or the communication style, but Mitt Romney at the end of this next converse is going to have a 90-plus percent voting score when you look at the Trump agenda, that's my prediction.

I think we talk about this idea of a tipping point and, look. I've been at the ledge many times. OK? And I have fallen off the ledge many times, thinking that we've reached the tipping point. Let's acknowledge that. But I do think when we look back at the totality of what has happened and you look at the history of events, then you realize that the tipping point is not something that happens immediately. It's something that's a slow roll that eventually gets faster and faster and faster. And Joey probably understands this better than anybody, because he's in the courtroom when things like this happen. But in addition to that, this is what scares me. And I say this with all sincerity. It scares me now that the president is so outraged by the Woodward book right now that he is furious, and he is going into a greater bunker mentality than he has been in the past. And now we've seen this op-ed come out right now, so he's looking around saying, ""Who can I trust?"" And for somebody that we think has bouts of paranoia at times and bouts of anger and is not able to keep it in check, that's scary. JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Bob Woodward writes in his book and describes that his aides think the president is lonely. They think he's paranoid. There is a quote where he says, ""I think people are out to get me."" I think in that case he's talking about Robert Mueller. That he is watching six to eight hours of television. When you have this and you have the op-ed, and next Tuesday you're going to see names attached in great detail in the Woodward book, I think it's going to add to the -- BASH: Can I add one other thing to just to -- sort of atmospheric observation, that people who I talk to in and around Trump world, who are hopelessly optimistic no matter what happens, no matter how many cliffs they come to the edge of and what you've come to the edge of, Mark, are feeling and sounding really beaten down today. There's just a different vibe. Even coming through the phone and texts from these people that don't normally get beaten down. It's different. BLITZER: Yes, and it's like a one-two punch.

So we have this problem with this cancer that is al Qaeda that may be a couple thousand people strong in a worldwide population of 1.5 billion.

Plenty of people on both sides of the issue are demonstrating now and a new op-ed on our Belief Blog has some pretty strong words for opponents of gay marriage saying they aren't really defending the bible's values, but are using the bible to defend their own.

They may ask him about anxiety, about depression, about stress. Those are standard questions that are typically asked.

At some point the coalition, NATO and the United states and our allies, are going to have to decide, when do actions like this medieval siege, as they put it, that's happening in Misrata rise to the level of a humanitarian crisis that requires them to go back and re-evaluate the use of military force? They may decide to enlist the help of the Arab League, which the op-ed references. They may decide to go back to the U.N. and a U.N. resolution to amend it, which the op-ed also mentions. But as it currently exists, the op-ed doesn't advance the cause of seeing Gadhafi go, and nothing they say in this op-ed indicates a willingness to use force to achieve that goal. MALVEAUX: So you worked with President Bush. I covered President Bush. And it was no secret that he was frustrated with international organizations groups like NATO, like the United Nations, because he felt that they didn't move fast enough, that there was always consensus-building. And that took a lot of time. Do you think that under the Obama doctrine, do you think the administration is doing what it can at a pace that's fast enough to accomplish this mission in Libya? TOWNSEND: Suzanne, look, President Bush was not against using coalitions. And we saw a large coalition operation in Afghanistan, and still do. And so I think what you're seeing now is the downside of a coalition. This is a time -- this is a point in the effort in Libya where time will matter and Libyan lives, additional lives, will be lost if we are too slow. And so, frankly, Suzanne, given what we're seeing in places like Misrata, Brega, Benghazi, I really do think the coalition needs to consider now, before it gets any worse, amending the use of military force to achieve the objective of ousting Gadhafi. MALVEAUX: Fran Townsend, thank you very much for your perspective. A very interesting piece, this op-ed the president wrote with two other world leaders.

What do you make of that and did the New York Times P.R. person say anything about that? STELTER: Yes. So far, no indication. I'm hoping to talk with other editors there and get more information about that. It does see him like this, this op-ed, and this Woodward book is singing the exact same tune. You look at all the anonymous sources who have told CNN reporters in the past day, that yes, I spoke to Bob Woodward. It's as if many of these officials want the public to know they're trying to blow the whistle or trying to save the country, an incredible set of circumstances. And as you said, this is very, very rare. Only a few times in the paper's history to publish something like this. TAPPER: All right, Brian Stelter, thank you so much. Let's bring the panel back. And let me read another quote from this op-ed, from an anonymous senior Trump administration official, ""The bigger concern is not what Mr. Trump has done to the presidency, but rather what we as a nation have allowed him to do to us. We have sunk low with him and allowed our discourse to be stripped of civility. Senator John McCain put it best in his farewell letter, 'All Americans should heed his words and break free of the tribalism trap with the high aim of uniting through our shared values and love of this great nation.'"" Jeffrey Toobin, I don't think this op-ed is going to make that point so much as underline the point of the Woodward book. But what do you think? JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: No. I think it is -- it is cumulative with the Woodward book with the -- with the Omarosa book, with the Michael Wolf book, with the journalism that we see every day. I mean, you know, journalists -- our CNN colleagues who cover the White House, when I cover the White House, we quote senior administration officials all the time. This is just sort of an elaborated quote of senior administration officials. Sure it's more detailed and it's more personal. But the idea that there are sources in the administration who will talk anonymously to jerk to journalists is not new, it's not new with the Trump administration. What's new is the sort of the magnitude of the betrayal here. TAPPER: Well -- TOOBIN: And you know, people can believe it or not, but you have to conclude that it is consistent with basically all the other evidence that's coming out of this administration.

She said they -- they forcibly stopped her with lights and sirens. They didn`t and they did not violated anything like Segun says. They said, ""Do you have ID?""

And now investigate the leaker. To David's point, and you heard former President Obama saying this is not normal, it is just not normal, whether you're a democrat, a Republican, an independent, not sure what you are in politics. It's not normal for a president of the United States to tell the Justice Department what to do and what not to do. Is he involved on sentencing, drug policy, on prison reform? Sure. But on picking and choosing, put my opponents in jail, go easy on people who like me? That's not the way it's supposed to work, period. BLITZER: And it's not normal, Abby, for a president of the United States to accuse someone. He obviously is not happy this senior official attacked him the way he did. But accused this individual of treason, which is a specific legal charge that carries with it potentially the death sentence. ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and he's accused a lot of people of treason. To my knowledge, none of those people have done anything that would qualify as that. According to Woodward, he actually considered Gary Cohn's threat to quit treason. This is a president who uses that word pretty flippantly. But it's also worth pointing out that whoever this person is that wrote this op-ed didn't, to my knowledge, leak anything. There was nothing of real substance in this op-ed. There was no sensitive national security information. There were some opinions about the president's temperament he didn't like, but now President Trump is saying, I want Jeff Sessions to investigate this person, and this is one of the reasons why I'm concerned about security clearances. This is a president who keeps mixing up issues that are really unrelated to each other, in part, because he doesn't seem to understand the foundations of some of these things. This is not necessarily leaking. This does not necessarily have to do with someone's security clearance. And this is no place, apparently, for the Justice Department to weigh in. KING: As he keeps attacking a book and an op-ed that say he's erratic and doesn't understand how things work in Washington, he keeps being erratic and showing he doesn't know how things work in Washington. GREGORY: It is interesting that just as former President Obama attacked Republican leaders for not standing up to the administration, how about the attorney general of the United States.

I get along very well with Dr. Fauci. I have a very good relationship. COLLINS: Dr. Fauci said he found the recent attacks by the White House, including an anonymous memo criticizing him, bizarre. FAUCI: If you talk to reasonable people in the White House, they realize that was a major mistake on their part, because it doesn't do anything but reflect poorly on them. COLLINS: As for the president's trade adviser, Fauci said there are no words. FAUCI: I can't explain Peter Navarro. He's in a world by himself. So I don't even want to go there. COLLINS: Under the headline, ""Anthony Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on,"" Navarro cited multiple instances where he and Fauci have disagreed and said he only listens to him with skepticism and caution. COLLINS: The attack by an official with no medical experience on a task force member while the administration is dealing with an ongoing pandemic was stunning. Hours after it was published, a White House spokeswoman said the op-ed was ""the opinion of Peter alone and did not go through the clearance process."" But the same press shop distancing itself from the attack on Fauci was the same one that anonymously distributed a memo last weekend questioning his judgment. KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: There's no opposition research being dumped to reporters. COLLINS: Tension has been brewing between Navarro and Fauci for months over the use of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug touted by Trump. While the administration has tried to limit Fauci's appearances, he's continued to speak candidly about his relationship with the president. FAUCI: My input to the president is now a bit indirect. It goes through the vice president. But, clearly, the vice president literally every day is listening to what we have to say. COLLINS: Starting today, the Trump administration has ordered hospitals to bypass the CDC by sending all COVID-19 data to a central database in Washington. The White House says the change will streamline things, but the move has concerned some health experts, like the former acting CDC Director Richard Besser, who told Dr. Sanjay Gupta this: DR. RICHARD BESSER, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: What I worry, with the data going directly to HHS, is that it could be further politicized. And that's the last thing you want. CDC is the nation's public health agency. They need to be getting these data. COLLINS: And on the flight back on Air Force One, the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, said Peter Navarro was speaking for himself when he posted that op-ed.

BLITZER: You're also getting some new information from the courts right now about Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman who was seeking an opportunity to avoid being under house arrest. SCIUTTO: That's right. A little more than a month after he was arrested for multiple crimes related to his work for Ukraine, for the pro-Russian government of Ukraine, he violated, the prosecutors argue, the terms of his plea agreement. He was allowed some freedom of movement. He was allowed out of house arrest. He was allowed off of GPS tracking in exchange for him putting up $11 million in property assets. But during that time as well, the judge had instructed him not to make public comments related to the case that could prejudice the case. And yet the special counsel found out that as recently as last week, he was working, ghost-writing an op-ed, an editorial, along with a Russian known to U.S. intelligence. Now, Wolf, you can make the argument even though he is now going on trial here that he has the right to make a living. This is paid work. But the special counsel is arguing that this fell under the terms of that agreement because it would be making public comment. It might prejudice the case. It's an investigation of Russia, after all, and he was writing this editorial with a Russian known to U.S. intelligence. So it will now be up to the judge to decide whether the terms of this plea agreement are rescinded. BLITZER: Yes. As part of the bail agreement, he was not supposed to make statements to the media, and here he was drafting an op-ed, an editorial that would be for the media. SCIUTTO: Newspapers are part of the media. BLITZER: That's correct. Not exactly a brilliant move on his part. We will see what the judge decides. All right, Jim Sciutto, thanks very much.

Our senior White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, is on the scene for us. Jim, as we learn more about what President Trump knew about Michael Flynn's lies, the president has been speaking out about the man he fired. JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf. President Trump is showing a lot of sympathy for his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators. The Russian investigation seems very much on the president's mind these days, as he officially offered an endorsement to an accused child molester, Roy Moore, in the Alabama Senate race But it's the president's senior team that may warrant the most attention tonight for putting forward an argument that essentially the president is above the law.

1318954,1633059,CNN,New Day Sunday,"Times""? BLEACHER: This has happened before. There have been different cases where you're able to hear from people imprisoned. I remember, last year, ""The New York Times"" published, in a very different situation, of course, an op-ed from a Guantanamo Bay detainee. Now, that one was relayed by phone. It was transcribed from Arabic. This is a very different situation. This may have been a letter that was sent through the mail, or this may have been via phone from the prison. We don't know for sure. I did notice one ""New York Times"" editor wrote this was the first column that we've seen from her. Maybe there's more coming. If we have time, I think we should read one more quote from the op-ed. It's about the number of embeds that were in Iraq when she was there. And this is what she wrote. Through my deployment, I never saw that tally, the number of embeds go above 12. In other words, in all of Iraq, which contained 31 million people and 117,000 U.S. troops, no more than a dozen American journalists were covering military operations. This is important because we need to see all sides in wartime, or whenever we need reporters embedded. We need to have reporters embedded, and we also need to have reporters independently verify information not embedded with the military. And this op-ed is pointing out how there's been very little coverage from Iraq, a very dangerous place, of course, in which to report. We saw earlier this week, a freelance Iraqi photographer killed this week in the fighting in northern Iraq. But this op-ed pointed out for years there's been relatively little coverage from the ground there. PAUL: Good point. All right. Brian Stelter, so good to see you, sir. Thank you for being here.
