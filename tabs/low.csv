1919931,2236270,CNN,Erin Burnett Outfront,"in a crisis when it woke up this morning trying to deal with the fallout from that book with Bob Woodward. And the president directing who he believes are loyal aides in this White House to find out who it was that spoke with the veteran reporter for his book, a book that also made stunning allegations, a lot of which seemed to be backed up by this op-ed. And now they're scrambling to not only mount the defense to that book but also to figure out who it was that wrote this op-ed. Kate, there was already this growing sense of paranoia here in the West Wing. Staffers often suspected that any time anything negative was published about them, it was someone in the White House who didn't like them. And now, they're predicting that since the paranoia is only going to get worse with this op-ed, they're trying to figure out who it is that wrote this as the president's anger about this only continues to grow here tonight, Kate. BOLDUAN: Yes. It's not to a boiling point already or even know where it is right now. Kaitlan, thanks so much. OUTFRONT now, David Gergen, former presidential adviser to four presidents, Dana Bash is here, CNN's chief political correspondent, and Patrick Healy, he's a politics editor for ""The New York Times."" Thank you all so much for being here. Patrick, you had read it and you just heard me reread the whole thing for our viewers. I'm not going to ask you the name of who wrote this. You wouldn't tell me even if you knew. But what do you make of ""The New York Times"" publishing this? PATRICK HEALY, POLITICS EDITOR, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, I don't know the name and the op-ed pages are managed separately than the news department, so it was handled separately. But, look, it is unprecedented. I mean the editorial board of ""The New York Times"" and the op-ed editors at the ""Times"" look over submissions very carefully, very deliberately and deliberatively and, you know, you can be sure they know exactly who this person is. It was probably vetted very closely. There was a lot of care and just knowing the people up there, probably a lot of discussion went in, not only to the content, but also to the appropriateness of publishing an anonymous editorial. Like you said, it is unprecedented. The ""Times"" takes very seriously whether or not to use anonymous information. And I think in the ""Times,"" they sort of said this, that they believe and we believe, the editorial page believes that the importance of the subject matter, the details, the specificity of the discussions that were going on inside those rooms warranted publication, met a standard of newsworthiness and criticalness to understand what is going on inside of the Trump White House.

WHITFIELD: So do you feel like you've figured it out who the person is? Do you believe the White House has figured it out? CAPUTO: I believe the White House is getting closer to it. I love the fact that -- WHITFIELD: Well how come you know and they don't? CAPUTO: Well, I believe they are getting there. I have my opinions. You know, I started with this. Who is the person who I believe hates the President the most? Who is the person in the administration who has screamed about him in their own private office and gone forward and purged their entire office of Trump people? That's what I'm looking at. The language of the op-ed I think is useless to look at because it's a ghost writer. If we did like we -- Remember when primary colors came out and they actually compared the writing through a software program and discovered that it was Klein (ph) wrote that book. I believe that would be useless in this regard because ghost writers write for dozens and dozens of people. It's not going to get us any closer. We'll be able to identify the ghost writer, but then we'd have to get the ghost writer tell us who this person is. WHITFIELD: All right. Are you thinking it's a matter of days, weeks, or months? CAPUTO: I'll tell you this. I think that, first of all, this person will never admit it. Because in my mind, the author of this op-ed believes that she is a hero to the American people. That she, in fact, should be -- WHITFIELD: She? CAPUTO: -- the president instead of Donald Trump. And in my mind I believe that the President should move forward with a team of people to discover who this is. But the President himself should focus on the mid-terms. Because -- We are going down a rabbit hole, you know, by gaslighting the President into believing his closest aides with those clever words dropping this op-ed are plotting against him. They're sending him down a rabbit hole instead of off on to the Hastings (ph) where he should be campaigning for Republican candidates so that we keep the House and embolden the Senate in support of the President's policies. If he focuses on this instead of the campaign trail, we are in real trouble. WHITFIELD: All right. We'll leave it there. Michael Caputo, good to hear from you. Thanks so much. CAPUTO: Thank you.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) COSTELLO: In about an hour some of the nation's top CEOs will convene at the White House as president Obama makes his push to help the nation's long term unemployed rejoin the workforce. Among the executives who are expected to attend, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, Don Thompson of McDonald's, Jim McNerney of Boeing, and Larry Fink of the financial services firm, Blackrock. Joining me now to talk about this meeting is Sam Polk, founder and executive director of Groceryships an organization that helps needy families eat healthy. A great organization but Polk is perhaps more well-known for a powerful op-ed he wrote in ""The New York Times."" Polk is a former hedge fund guy and he talked about his addiction to money and how he wasn't alone in his quest to enrich himself. Here's a bit of Polk's op-ed. Quote, ""in my last year on Wall Street my bonus was $3.6 million and I was angry it wasn't big enough. I was 30 years old, had no children to raise, no debts to pay, no philanthropic goal in mind. I wanted more money for exactly the same reason an alcoholic needs another drink. I was addicted."" So welcome, Sam, and before we - before we explore your op-ed, a question for you about the president's meeting with these CEOs. The president is trying to convince them to hire the long term unemployed. And we know especially after reading your op-ed that CEOs are capitalist, they're businessmen, they pay attention to the bottom line. Will they listen to the president? SAM POLK, FOUNDER AND EXEC. DIRECTOR, GROCERYSHIPS: I don't know. It took me a long time and a lot of work with a counselor to understand that the sort of issues that were facing people on the lower end of the economic scale in America were a lot more real than the big concerns for me which were how many millions of dollars my bonus was, whether the guy next to me was making more than me. It really did take a lot of work. COSTELLO: Back to your op-ed, then. You wrote about 2008, the year so many people lost their homes and their 401(k)s. You wrote, quote, as the world crumbled I profited. I'd seen the crash coming, but instead of trying to help people it would hurt the most, people who didn't have a million dollars in the bank, I'd make money off it. You know right now there's a real debate in this country about class warfare. Is it really class warfare or is it something else? POLK: It goes back to what I said which was for me, you know, I'm not an expert, I'm not a scientist, I'm just a guy that had some experience with addiction to drugs and alcohol, which I got sober from when I was 22, and I - over the",0.0,2014-01-31
1920101,2236442,CNN,The Situation Room,"level and certainly is amplified by that op-ed in ""The New York Times,"" which as you said, Wolf, makes many of the same themes. Now, as for Defense Secretary James Mattis, the president said just a short time ago in the Roosevelt Room when he was meeting with Republican leaders, he said the defense secretary's job is safe. He said he was heartened to see his denial of a suggestion that he has the sort of grasp of a fifth or sixth grader on some foreign policy matters. And he seems to say that he will stay on. But Wolf, again, the witch hunt is on for people who did or didn't talk to Bob Woodward, and I assume, Wolf, it's also going to be on for the person who wrote this ""New York Times"" op-ed. BLITZER: Yes. They're looking for that person specifically, but a whole bunch of others, as well. Jeff Zeleny, thank you very much. I want more on the breaking news right now. Our White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins is working her sources for us. Kaitlan, what are you hearing? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, people are stunned by this op-ed that just came out. When the White House woke up this morning, they were already knee deep in a crisis, trying to manage the fallout from that Bob Woodward book and the claims that were made in that. And then this fell into their lap this afternoon, and they don't know what to react. There is no reaction yet. They're saying that this is a bombshell. I'm not sure if I'm texting more people in the White House, asking them who they think wrote this anonymous op-ed in ""The New York Times"" or if more people in the White House are texting me, asking me who I thought wrote this op-ed in ""The New York Times."" Wolf, the reaction here is really something. Aides are scrambling to try to figure out who it is that works in this administration that went and wrote an op-ed of this nature. So far, there's been no official response from the White House, but a few reporters were sitting outside Sarah Sanders' office earlier right behind this door including myself, and she said that the White House had no reaction yet, that they would let us know when they did. But it wasn't even clear if they'd had a chance to read this op-ed yet at that point, because one reporter even printed out the op-ed, Wolf, and handed it to some of the officials standing upstairs. Now, the president has an event with sheriffs in here in the East Room at the White House. He just showed up 30 minutes late to that meeting. It's unclear if that was so he could read this op-ed or if the White House is trying to form some kind of a response to this, Wolf. But clearly, it's certainly going to be another problem for them to deal with",0.0,2018-09-05
1224597,1533971,CNN,Erin Burnett Outfront,"delivery. Then, Erin, you have the other problem. No one really involved in these talks trusts anyone. You have a trust deficit between the U.S. and Russia. Certainly, you have the Syrian president saying they don't want to work with the U.S. They don't trust the U.S. and of the U.S. relying on Russia to make Syria good on its word. So, no one is expecting to solve all those problems in the next 24 hours. What they do want to have is the framework for an agreement that shows that they can overcome these differences in the next few days toward something concrete. BURNETT: And, Jim, you know, obviously, you know, they're having these talks, right? All right? But the problem is, the real headline today came from Vladimir Putin and the op-ed that he put in ""The New York Times"". He wrote that America is not exceptional, slamming President Obama who had discussed and just that in his address to the nation earlier this week, and said America is dead wrong on who is using gas in Syria. How much did that op-ed overshadow what was going on in Geneva today? I mean, obviously, in the United States, that was the story. SCIUTTO: Yes, not the warmest comments. Well, the op-ed came out as we were taking off from Washington for Geneva. We asked senior U.S. officials onboard the flight about it and they said, listen, they had read the op-ed. But the Russians came up with this proposal. The U.S. thinks it's a serious proposal and they are here to test the seriousness of that proposal. So, their view is that as long as the Russians are engaged, as long as they can talk seriously about doing something about Syria's chemical weapons, it's more important what said here than that was said in ""The New York Times."" But I think it does speak to the real and genuine differences between these two sides and the question is, are those differences irreconcilable? That's what we're going to find out over the next 24 to 48 hours. BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Jim Sciutto. As we said, late tonight from Geneva. And I want to go to Montana now because the accused newly wed murderer has been released. That's right. You just heard what I said and I didn't misspeak. A Montana judge has decided to let Jordan Linn Graham out on bond until she goes to trial for the murder of her husband. Now, police say Graham pushed her husband Cody Johnson of a cliff at Glacier National Park, just eight days after they were murdered. Now, prosecutors say Graham has changed her story several time. She claims they were in a fight and he fell. Then she admitted she pushed him off in a fit of anger, still says she didn't intend to hurt him. OUTFRONT tonight, Kyung Lah.

It's the work of the steady state."" Your reaction? CLAPPER: Well, again, Trump opponents will find this reassuring it is a steady state and there's steady hands trying to navigate the ship of state so to speak. But at the same time, those who don't agree will find this just another example of the so-called deep state. So -- CAMEROTA: But I mean, from where you sit as somebody in the national security space, do you give any credence to what Rudy Giuliani just tweeted? And I think that this is instructive -- what he just tweeted -- because it will tell us what the talking points out of the White House will be today, which is this is a leaker. It's probably somebody from the national security space. This is a dangerous person. They should somehow be outed. CLAPPER: Well, I don't know about -- I don't agree that this person is dangerous -- air quotes. This -- I mean, obviously, the White House and the Trump camp are deeply offended by this because it really -- what it suggests is disloyalty to the president personally. But -- and I think Giuliani jumping to the conclusion -- well, this person has a clearance and -- which probably he or she probably does. But as previously leaked classified information, that's a big leap and there's no basis for that assertion at all. CAMEROTA: Well, here's what Sec. Mike Pompeo, who is overseas right now -- when he got word of this op-ed here's how he responded this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: It is sad that you have someone who would make that choice. I come from a place where if you're not in a position to execute the commander's intent, you have a singular option and it's to leave. And this person said, according to ""The New York Times"" -- chose not only to stay but to undermine what President Trump and this administration are trying to do. And I have to tell you, I just -- I find -- I find the media's efforts in this regard to undermine this administration incredibly disturbing. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Next question. POMPEO: And I'll answer your other question directly because I know someone will say gosh, he didn't answer the question. It's not mine. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAMEROTA: I mean look, it's interesting to hear how he's framing it. I think that the person who wrote this op-ed has more than just a single option to leave. Obviously, the whole case that the person is making is that this person has chosen to stay to try to work within the administration to stop some of the president's impulsivity. CLAPPER: Yes.

I mean all three of the delegation trips that I led here in 2003 and 2004 -- or, actually, 2004 and 2005 -- they always make you wait until 30 minutes before the meeting and then you go. And some of those meetings were at 10:00 at night, some were at 5:00 in the afternoon. As you know from the excellent reporting being done by your folks here, there's a lot of security concerns, and they are very concerned where Gadhafi is at any given moment. That's one of the issues, but we have been making ourselves available. We have been doing a lot of back-channel meetings with friends and associates that I have here, and we have met with the chief of staff and one of the sons, and today with the prime minister, a very lengthy meeting for two hours. So, we're going to give them until tomorrow. We're not going to stay beyond that. And we have given them some suggestions, and we expect a response by midday tomorrow. And if we don't, we will done exit conversation with your people and let you know our feelings. BLITZER: What's the major headline that you got out of these meetings with other leaders? I take it you met with Saif Al-Islam Gadhafi, one of the sons of Moammar Gadhafi. What are they saying to you? WELDON: Well, we actually didn't meet with Saif. I have met with Saif probably 10 times over the past seven years, both in America and here in Libya. I have not yet met with Saif. I have offered, if he is available. I have met with Saadi. And the general thrust is obviously that they want peace and they want to find a way out of this. But as I have explained to them, there's certain things that have to be done according to our president and our secretary of state, who I'm here to support. We don't have a different agenda. There's no compromise on our part. Our only mission here is to talk face to face with them and say this is reality and this is a grave situation, and you need to do certain things that we suggest that we think will get our administration to respond to your actions. And again, we're not doing any negotiating. They know me, they have seen my efforts. I have not taken anything from their country in the way of financial benefits, and I'm here only because I want to avoid war. I don't want to see American soldiers killed, and I don't want to see more innocence Libyans killed. BLITZER: You wrote an op-ed in ""The New York Times"" this week saying that once you meet face to face with Moammar Gadhafi, you will tell him to step down. Is that still your intention?

Now, you have actually been to this exact region within Gaza, and you were telling me it's extremely dangerous. OCTAVIA NASR, CNN SENIOR EDITOR FOR ARAB AFFAIRS: It is dangerous. It is chaotic. It is also closed off. It's very hard to get to Gaza, because it is sandwiched in between Israel, on one side, and Egypt on the other side. You have to cross borders in order to get there, so it's not like open borders, can drive your car. It's pretty difficult to get in there. And once you're in there, life is very dire. It's a very difficult situation, and it's also very dangerous. And not just because of the Israeli air strikes but also inside. Assassinations go on and also, Hamas running the show is -- makes life very difficult for many. PHILLIPS: And Benjamin Netanyahu has come forward, someone we should say is running for prime minister come February, coming forward saying Hamas must be toppled, that this action must take place. However, there are even Israelis saying, ""Wow, the government is being too harsh."" And you brought this to my attention, which I thought was interesting, from ""The Haaretz"" newspaper, and the op-ed, you know, calling Israel the neighborhood bully, saying, ""Once again, Israel's violent responses, even if there is justification for them, exceed all proportion and cross every red line of humanness, morality, international law and wisdom. What began yesterday in Gaza is a war crime, and the foolishness of a country."" It seems like now even Israelis are coming to the point where they're, ""OK, we've got to stop this fighting. There has to be another way to solve this issue."" NASR: You know, people like, you know, the op-ed that you're reading from ""Haaretz,"" I mean, many people are making those comments, basically saying that Israel is losing the P.R. war at this point, because people looking at those images, 300-plus people dead in only as much days, as many days, it's too much for them to handle. You're looking at demonstrations. You're looking at condemnation, but not action. If you look at the demonstrations, for -- for example, across the Arab world, people are demanding an end to the violence in Gaza. People are not even thinking beyond that. All they want is for an end. They want their leaders to step up to the plate, do something to end that violence. But it seems that they're looking at the situation on the ground, and there's no end in sight for this violence. So you're hearing, you know, in op-eds. You're hearing the commentators.

His comments made more interesting given Romney was the party's 2012 nominee for president. Here's part of his opinion piece in the ""Washington Post,"" quote, ""The president has not risen to the mantle of the office."" President Trump firing back just a short time ago. CNN congressional correspondent, Sunlen Serfaty, is joining us with details. Sunlen, what is the president saying? SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Ana, President Trump responding over Twitter and making it clear that he is not happy about the harsh words of the incoming Senator Mitt Romney, that harsh op-ed published last night. In his tweet, Trump said, quote, ""Here we go with Mitt Romney, but not so fast. Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. I would much prefer that Mitt focuses on border security and so many of things where he can be helpful. I won big and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a team player and win."" That in reference to the outgoing former Republican Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona, who, at times, really took the mantle of the chief critic of President Trump among Republicans.

The Justice Department trying to block AT&T from buying Time Warner. Time Warner, obviously, the parent company of CNN. However, what happened? We saw a slip-up by the government's lawyer, nearly wound up keeping a key witness from testifying. Why? What happened? Let's discuss. We have CNN's senior media correspondent, host of ""Reliable Sources,"" Brian Stelter, and CNN Politics media and business reporter Hadas Gold. Hadas, what almost happened and why? HADAS GOLD, CNN POLITICS MEDIA AND BUSINESS REPORTER: Chris, it was really fascinating yesterday in court. The entire morning was taken up with the two counsels conferring with the judge and the judge turns on this white noise machine so nobody in the court can hear what's going on. And later we find out that the president of Sling TV, which is one of these over the top live TV streaming services, he was sent the transcript of the testimony of the witness before him by his own Sling counsel, which is not allowed in court. The witnesses are supposed to sort of be in this vacuum. They're not supposed to know what the questions were to the other witnesses. The DOJ's lawyers immediately let the judge know that this was the case. And then the judge had to decide whether he was going to strike this witness from even testifying. And that would have been a huge blow to the DOJ because Warren Schlichting, the president of Sling TV, made some compelling points. He said, listen, if Time Warner and AT&T become one, they're going to always be in a win-win situation with us when we negotiate to try to carry places like CNN on our platform, because if they raise the prices, then we make less money, they make more money. If they decide to just -- if we can't reach a deal and we can't put Time Warner content on our platform, then our subscribers will potentially walk to DirecTV and then AT&T wins again. CUOMO: The burden for the DOJ will be to show that other mergers of this kind have created exactly that kind of imbalance. Tough call for them. So, in terms of what this might mean, how do you see it at this stage? BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's almost as if the TV business model is on trial here because the entire history of cable television, dating back to the '80s, is a tug of war between programmers, like Time Warner, which owns CNN, and distributors, like DirecTV or Comcast. Now, increasingly, you know, Comcast now owns NBC, wants to be in both businesses.

Now McConnell and many others may have to contend with Moore. Moore stands a very good chance of winning this race in a very red state. He is running against a Democrat named Doug Jones. That election slated for December 12th -- Alisyn, Chris. ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: OK. Alex, thank you very much for all of that news out of Alabama. Look, Roy Moore has said lots of inflammatory things to you on our air here, as well as he's written them. I'm going to get to one of his op-ed in a second. Let's bring in CNN Politics reporter and editor at large Chris Cillizza to talk about this development overnight in Alabama. Chris, let's just talk -- in case people don't know who Roy Moore is -- CHRIS CILLIZZA, CNN POLITICS REPORTER: Sure. CAMEROTA: Let's just -- I hope we have it, and maybe we can read the op-ed that he wrote. This was when Keith Ellison, the first Muslim member of Congress, was being sworn in, Roy Moore wrote I believe an op-ed in which he said this. ""In 1943 we would never have allowed a member of Congress to take their oath on Mein Kampf, or someone in the 1950s to swear allegiance to the 'Communist Manifesto.' Congress has the authority and should act to prohibit Ellison from taking the congressional oath today."" He did not want Congressman Ellison to use the Quran. CILLIZZA: That's right. And do -- CAMEROTA: Roy Moore feels strongly about the Bible and the Ten Commandments being a part of public life. CILLIZZA: Yes, a few things. One, he has said that there are Sharia law governing communities in Illinois. He didn't know what DACA was when asked about it on the campaign trail. And then go back a little bit. The reason that Roy Moore is the figure he is in Alabama, the reason that he had this strong conservative base of support that propelled him to victory despite McConnell and Trump being for Luther Strange are two fights.

He fought against that displaying in courts. The second was when he refused to sanction gay marriage after the Supreme Court had legalized it across the country.

BERMAN: But it is interesting when the vice president has to go out of his way to say, ""In a heartbeat, I'd take a lie detector."" NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Extraordinary that he White House thought this was a good idea in many ways. I think the reaction to this op-ed has really underscored the chaos. You've had Kellyanne Conway, for instance, say that this was the point of the op-ed, to sow chaos. It certainly has done that, but it also, I think, reflects the chaos that has gone on in this White House for many, many months. Other writers have written about it, and each time you've seen those writers, their book sales go up. Their argument's elevated. And anyway, I think that's what you see in this case, Mike Pence having to go out there and address it. And you know this was clearly a strategy that was coordinated by this White House. Bill Shine is a top coms guy in the White House at this point. He, of course, worked for FOX News. So trotting Mike Pence out, who's often used as a sort of character witness for this -- this White House, for Donald Trump in particular. It really was an extraordinary moment to have him come out there and say he would, in a heartbeat, get strapped down and really testify about this op-ed and prove that he didn't write it. CAMEROTA: Michael, there was another person out this weekend on the Sunday shows, including with Jake Tapper. That was Kellyanne Conway. And she had a different take on all of this, basically that there has been some sort of law broken, so let me play for you that moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Is that a directive to DOJ to investigate? KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO DONALD TRUMP: So from what I understand, there can be an investigation if there is criminal activity, perhaps -- TAPPER: And there doesn't appear to be any. CONWAY: I don't know that, and I don't think you know that. In other words, that -- TAPPER: What would the criminal activity be? CONWAY: It really depends on what else has been divulged by an individual. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAMEROTA: What do you think of that, Michael? MICHAEL SHEAR, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, look, I think that was sort of a crafty grasping at straws by Kellyanne Conway, because what she is doing is trying to expand the idea of what the FBI would look at, beyond just the distribution of the one particular op-ed and suggest that, perhaps, if the person that districted the op-ed to ""The New York Times,"" to our paper, then perhaps they've been leaking other information.",0.0,2018-09-10

While Akiva Eldar of Ha'aretz writes, ""If the Israelis are retreating into what he calls an ""inner logic of `our' conflict, as if Israel and Hamas were the only actors on the regional stage."" Well, Akiva Eldar joins me now form Tel Aviv. Now is it fair to say that the media in Israel is focused on what's happening in Sterot (ph) and Echkelon (ph) more so than what's taking place on the ground in Gaza? AKIVA ELDAR, ""HA'ARETZ: I think that the problem with the media, and this has been also the problem in the recent war in summer 2006, that we're too busy with scoring points. It's like, you know, a soccer game. And who's scoring more goals, and who is punching harder? And who is going to lie on the ground at the end of this - of the coming round? And the problem is that we don't look at the day after. What is going to happen to our relationship with the press? It's like, you know, a wall that is going on. Even I hope that the British media is more busy with following and covering Afghanistan than the way the Israeli media is covering Gaza and the West Bank. And Gaza and the West Bank are just across the street. So even if you win this round, and you hit the Hamas very hard, the media has to think about the implications it will have, not even in the long run, in the short run. On our Palestinian policies with whom we are trying to conduct political negotiations right now. And a few days ago, President Abbas decided to stop. And he decided to come back to the talks. But this is accumulating. And at the end of the day, the media has also to talk about the price that Israel is going to pay in the long run. And we are not learning from previous mistakes. SWEENEY: Well, am I right in thinking that there has been a change in the Israeli media, because my experience of it has been that it has been very concerned with what happened in the Palestinian-Israeli relationship and beyond in terms of other regional relations with Lebanon and Iran, Syria, etcetera. You're saying that's not the case now? ELDAR: No. You know, the Israeli media was busy was criticizing al Jazeera. That al Jazeera is not covering properly or they're not balanced enough, covering what's happening in Israel in Sterot (ph) and in Echkelon (ph) with the kassam rockets. And they're just focusing on what's happening in Gaza. The other problem, to be honest, is the fact that the Israeli media is not allowed to go into Gaza and cover it.

1856833,2172948,CNN,New Day,"OK, thank you very much. GREGORY: So, the focus at the AT&T-Time Warner merger court battle with the Justice Department turning to another media merger. How a past deal is playing a big role in this case, coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GREGORY: Attorneys focusing on a different merger in the AT&T-Time Warner trial as the Justice Department sues to block the telecom giant from acquiring Time Warner, which owns CNN. Let's bring in CNN senior media correspondent and host of ""RELIABLE SOURCES,"" Brian Stelter. And, ""CNN POLITICS"" media and business reporter Hadas Gold. Hadas, bring us up-to-date on how -- we're talking about the NBC- Comcast deal. That was the last big merger in media land. How is that brought into the trial? HADAS GOLD, MEDIA AND BUSINESS REPORTER, ""CNN POLITICS"": When NBC and Comcast merged, instead of a lawsuit between the Justice Department and the companies they entered into a settlement agreement that included certain conditions that the Justice Department said would keep them from being anti-competitive. Now, the government lawyers are looking at internal communications that AT&T executives had in preparation for that settlement condition to expire, which happens this year. And they're saying that the arguments that AT&T were having internally about how those settlement conditions expiring would affect the industry are exactly the same arguments they're having against AT&T's merger with Time Warner. They say that it will raise prices. That AT&T and Time Warner will somehow be able to keep their content hostage from other distributors. And they're saying that's what AT&T executives were talking about with Comcast and NBC. Interestingly enough, the head of the antitrust division for the Justice Department, Makan Delrahim, was in court yesterday. I asked him if I should look into whether he was there on the day that we're talking about Comcast and he said no, I'm just here when I can get here and this is -- you know, I'm coming here to support our team. But interestingly enough, the last time he was in court was when a Comcast executive was testifying so a lot of people are connecting the dots there. GREGORY: So, Brian, if we look at the comparisons, anybody who's watching and still wants to know what's it going to mean in terms of access to content and prices that I have to pay -- and there is, of course, the political backdrop in Washington of all this as there was in that merger as well, which was also about just media getting too big and monopolistic. BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, HOST, CNN ""RELIABLE SOURCES"": Yes. The Obama administration did approve Comcast-NBC almost 10 years ago at this point, but with the conditions that Hadas was describing. The world has changed quite a bit since then, though. You think about the rise of Netflix, the popularity of Facebook and Snapchat and other social networking sites. The tech giants have become bigger and bigger.

I've acknowledged the reporter on it, gave one of the most heartfelt apologies on Twitter I've seen in a long time from a journalist, seemingly not acting under legal threat, but just expressing his heartfelt sorrow and also acknowledging, which is often true, that he had nothing to do with the graphic that was created. But the New York Post has a history of getting these kinds of things wrong, particularly when it involves people of color. I'm not saying that's what happened here, but I'm certainly saying that -- there's been a pattern of that. And The Post has given, in some ways, grudging, but real correction and apology for that. STELTER: Now, to a different Murdoch owned property, The Wall Street Journal, which had that op-ed about Dr. Jill Biden that caused a week of controversy. Was this such a waste of time, Margaret, all of these reactions and the backlash to the backlash to an op-ed? SULLIVAN: Well, it was a bit over the top, I think, that we seem to -- and I will joined in at myself that we seem to want to discuss this ad infinitum. But I think it does go to an issue which is that the Wall Street Journal's editorial page has had a number of very questionable op-ed pieces, you know, including one by Mike Pence, saying that there was no second wave and all kinds of other things like that. And then, you know, the Wall Street Journal's reporting staff is so strong and has done such good work that the split between the editorial page, the opinion side, and the news side was very, very noticeable. And I think that added into the story. STELTER: Yes, it definitely did. I think the highest high journalism this week was CNN and Bellingcat collaborating on this investigation into the poisoning of the Russian opposition leader. Remarkable work by Clarissa Ward knocking on the door of a suspected agent. You know, she deserves all the praise she's getting this week for doing that. And it's great to see CNN collaborating with it with a new organization, Bellingcat, which does these global investigations. Margaret, David, thank you both. Coming up here on RELIABLE SOURCES, democracy dies in darkness. That's been the slogan on the Washington Post masthead since 2017. But will it disappear at the end of the Trump presidency?

1318954,1633059,CNN,New Day Sunday,"Times""? BLEACHER: This has happened before. There have been different cases where you're able to hear from people imprisoned. I remember, last year, ""The New York Times"" published, in a very different situation, of course, an op-ed from a Guantanamo Bay detainee. Now, that one was relayed by phone. It was transcribed from Arabic. This is a very different situation. This may have been a letter that was sent through the mail, or this may have been via phone from the prison. We don't know for sure. I did notice one ""New York Times"" editor wrote this was the first column that we've seen from her. Maybe there's more coming. If we have time, I think we should read one more quote from the op-ed. It's about the number of embeds that were in Iraq when she was there. And this is what she wrote. Through my deployment, I never saw that tally, the number of embeds go above 12. In other words, in all of Iraq, which contained 31 million people and 117,000 U.S. troops, no more than a dozen American journalists were covering military operations. This is important because we need to see all sides in wartime, or whenever we need reporters embedded. We need to have reporters embedded, and we also need to have reporters independently verify information not embedded with the military. And this op-ed is pointing out how there's been very little coverage from Iraq, a very dangerous place, of course, in which to report. We saw earlier this week, a freelance Iraqi photographer killed this week in the fighting in northern Iraq. But this op-ed pointed out for years there's been relatively little coverage from the ground there. PAUL: Good point. All right. Brian Stelter, so good to see you, sir. Thank you for being here.
