1012769,1303318,CNN,Dr. Drew,"DR. DREW PINSKY, HOST: Here we go. Christmas right around the corner, guys, but how about taking a one hour breather right now. Sit back, put your feet up and join us for 60 minutes of give and take about the stories you care about most. Let`s get started. Good evening. You guys know Paulina Porizkova as a supermodel and rock star`s wife, which you might not know is that behind her face beautiful face was another woman entirely. One who hid a secret that she candidly discussed with me recently. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PINSKY: Paulina Porizkova was a supermodel in the 1980s and graced the covers of ""Sports Illustrated"" famed swimsuit edition not once but twice. And she`s now a talented writer and currently blogs for the ""Huffington Post."" She caught our attention when she recently wrote an article titled, ""Ending a mid-life affair with meds,"" in which she talks about her severe anxiety attacks and some depressive symptoms, and how she turned to the antidepressant Lexapro for help. So welcome, Paulina. Now, why - PAULINA PORIZKOVA, HAD ""AFFAIR"" WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS: Thank you. PINSKY: Before I ask you questions about why publicize this, now, let me give my personal reveals (ph) out of the way - PORIZKOVA: Please. I`ve been waiting for this (ph). PINSKY: Well, I know I just told you (INAUDIBLE), but my daughter is named Paulina and it was actually a friend of ours that said, ""You know, Paulina Porizkova is Czech, which my wife is Czech (ph) and that name is so pretty, and Paulina Pinsky and Paulina Porizkova and that`s just - PORIZKOVA: P.P. PINSKY: -- P.P. as we call her. PORIZKOVA: You know, that would be a little scary if you didn`t clarify. PINSKY: I know. It sounds like I`m just kind of a weird stalker. But it is in fact the case that we named her after you, so thank you for that. And that she`s heading up to New York for college. PORIZKOVA: Oh, my God, I`m so proud. Thank you. Is she just beautiful and intelligent - PINSKY: Yes. Just the same as you, exactly. Exactly. PORIZKOVA: Yes, exactly. PINSKY: So let`s go on with Lexapro - as I blush here. Let us - let us talk about Lexapro. Why publicize this issue now? PORIZKOVA: Well, you know what, I never thought of it as publicizing initially to tell you the truth, because I write, you know I`m a writer, and I write a blog for HuffPo, and I sort of write things that come to my mind. You know, I just - things I notice, things that I think about. And it seems that women my age sort of tend to, you know, we tend to think very much alike about aging and beauty and fame. And so I just thought, you know, this is something that I was dealing with and there was one point in my life when I was on Lexapro where I was - I",0.9998187083615973,2011-12-23

In the meantime, I want to bring back Richard Quest who does a lot about aviation travel advisory. What do you think? What's your reaction? How would this work? Will airlines be ready to help enforce some sort of new travel advisory that the governors in consultation with federal authorities might come up with? QUEST: They would if it had the force of law, but since it's an advisory, it doesn't sound like it's going to be that. I'm guessing, Wolf, it's going to be something like the advisory the CDC put out on Thursday, when the President had said he wanted all people leaving New York to be quarantined for 14 days or self-quarantine. In that particular one, it talks about truck drivers and other people needing supplies, stay in their vehicles, only traveling when absolutely necessary. Bearing in mind, he doesn't probably have the legal authority to create a full-blown quarantine or lockdown. And anyway, how would you do it? You know, who's going to be across the streets to stop people from going one side to the other? So bearing in mind, it's going to have to be based on the governors, and the governors aren't going to do it. So you're left with an advisory, which essentially means, Wolf, a reinforcing of the President Trump's existing guidelines, which is don't travel. And we've seen this with the airlines, by the way. If you look at all the major airlines, even within their seating plans, they're now doing social distancing, giving more space between passengers on the planes, which isn't difficult at the moment, because it's widely believed that -- well, it's widely believed that load factors number of people traveling is less than 20 percent of what it was. BLITZER: Good point, Richard Quest, reporting for us. Richard, thank you very much. The coronavirus has Russia now taking what appears to be some very dramatic moves. It's closing its borders. We'll go live to CNN's longtime Moscow correspondent to get the very latest. Stay with us here in THE SITUATION ROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: Russia is now taking a very dramatic step to contain and prevent the spread of coronavirus. Effective tomorrow night, Moscow time, nearly all of Russia's borders will be closed. This means air travel, rail, road, and pedestrian traffic into and out of other countries, all shut down. Our senior international correspondent, Matthew Chance, is in London right now. Matthew, just a few days ago, President Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian people that the outbreak of coronavirus was in his words, under control. But closing the borders indicates otherwise, doesn't it? MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It does. It indicates that finally the authorities in Russia are coming to grips with in confronting with the really dire situation they've got in front of them in terms of this coronavirus outbreak. You're right, all along,",0.999626307922272,2020-03-28
858332,1135419,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"and, if at all, that punk affected this doc. BOUDREAU: I was going to meet James O'Keefe. He was going to be part of a video shoot that was coming up that we were going to be a part of. And he had questions and concerns about having us there at the shoot. So he said, why don't you meet us in Maryland and we can talk about my concerns. I said, sure. He wanted me to come alone. I went alone. What ended up happening -- very long story. There was a plan to try to get me onto a boat and to fake seduce me on this boat or who knows how far it would have gone? It was a plan to embarrass me, to embarrass CNN, and that's essentially what you're referring to. But as far as how much will it be a part of the documentary, it will be part of it, because it was part of our journey as a reporter working on this story. But it is not the whole documentary by any means. We talked to a lot of young conservatives. and they're all going to be part of this documentary. Like I said, it is just a fly on the wall glimpse into this movement. And we'll see, hopefully, people find it interesting. BALDWIN: What time? BOUDREAU: 8:00 and 11:00 tonight, Saturday and Sunday. BALDWIN: Abby Boudreau, good deal. BOUDREAU: OK, thanks. BALDWIN: I'll watch. I'll watch. (LAUGHTER) You can watch that entire documentary called ""Right on the Edge"" tonight and Sunday, 8:00 and 11:00 eastern time. If you are headed to Europe any time soon, the U.S. State Department is expected to issue this new travel advisory. What does that mean and why are they doing it now? Find out coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BALDWIN: I want to take you back to our breaking story tonight, and that is the fact that Americans abroad, in Europe specifically, may soon be told to be extra careful. The U.S. State Department says an abundance of information about possible terror attacks is likely to bring a new travel advisory, we're hearing, as early as tomorrow morning. In fact, one U.S. official tells CNN it is a, quote, ""serious situation."" CNN's Phil Black joins us now from London. Phil, if I can begin on the British side, what are you hearing from government officials, parliament officials there? PHIL BLACK, CNN NEWS CORRESPONDENT: We've got some insight, Brooke, from a British intelligence official, a source that has told us that it's believed that this possible warning from the U.S. government is not related to any new intelligence about a threat or a plot, potential plot in Europe that was made public a few days ago. We learned of a plot, described as a possible Mumbai-style attack, like the one that took place in Mumbai two years ago, with a team of people attacking multiple sites, using small arms, guns and grenades. So we're told that it's",0.999626307922272,2010-10-02
1755991,2071762,CNN,New Day Saturday,"has issued warnings before and advisories as well. Cornell, to you, this law as Paris pointed out there, matches the Title 7 of Civil Rights Act of 1964. Let's put that up. An unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice. So what's wrong with making this mirror the federal statute? BROOKS: Let's be clear. First of all, state laws don't necessarily have to match Title 7. Point one. Point two, the law was sponsored by a legislator whose own business was being sued. Point one. Point two, the law also caps the amount of damages victims of discrimination are able to get. So in other words, it's harder to make a case of discrimination and it's harder to be made whole after you've been discriminated against. This law has been passed in a state with a long ugly history of discrimination. We recall that Michael Brown lost his life in Ferguson. We recall a young man by the name of Toy Sanford who ran out of gas, ended up in a jail cell, held for 96 hours without being arrested and who died there. This is also a state in which the students at the University of Missouri have been subjected to ugly racial slurs and bigotry. The point being here is that the NAACP state confidence issued this travel advisory out of concern for the citizens of the state. In the same way that the State Department being concerned about American citizens travel ago broad, the NAACP state confidence and the national NAACP being concerned about citizens traveling within Missouri. DENNARD: Victor -- (CROSSTALK) BLACKWELL: Go ahead. DENNARD: If the NAACP was so concerned about people traveling at the states they would issue travel advisories for people in their own headquarter in Baltimore, Maryland. They would issue travel advisories for the people in -- (CROSSTALK) BLACKWELL: Let me finish. Let him finish. DENNARD: They would issue travel advisories for people traveling in Chicago, Illinois. If you're going to talk about the whole history of things that had been, quote-unquote, discriminatory or bad for African-Americans which I am not denying. My point is simply this. When you have the Church of God in Christ the largest Pentecostal organization with 60 million members in the U.S. and economic impact in St. Louis in 2016 estimated for $30 million. 40,000 people coming into that city every year. You're going to tell them stay away? This policy, this ban, it's horrible. BLACKWELL: Well, how about -- DENNARD: Because it directly impacts its people who they actually need to serve. BLACKWELL: But the people in Missouri are not the only people being discriminated against in the country. Why specifically the state? And if you could talk to this as well, it expires on August 28th. I mean, that's the date that the law goes into effect. Why would that be the expiration date? Is this",0.999626307922272,2017-08-05

So, remember all that time you spent wiping down your groceries? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Virus transmission through direct contact, droplets and airborne aerosols. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROMANS: The CDC now says the risk of getting coronavirus from contaminated surfaces is low, although the risk is slightly higher indoors. And new this morning, a coalition of 60 top hospitals and health care institutions joined forces to encourage adults to get vaccinated. JARRETT: The nationwide campaign is designed to reassure that minorities and people living in rural communities that the vaccines are safe, effective and necessary to return to normal activities. Still some states are loosening up right now, Connecticut is ending all restrictions on May 19th, the governor still recommends wearing masks indoors, though, and more colleges now requiring vaccines to return to campus. EARLY START has the pandemic covered coast to coast. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN SENIOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York. Two of the nation's most prestigious universities have announced that they will require all students to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 before returning to campus in the fall. Yale and Columbia Universities joined more than three dozen U.S. colleges and universities such as Georgetown, Duke, Rutgers, Pomona and the University of Seattle in Washington requiring student vaccinations. Schools will provide vaccines. Schools will provide vaccines for students who have yet to be vaccinated. ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Alexandra Field. More than half of all U.S. adults have now received at least one dose of a vaccine, now officials are turning their attention to those who may be more hesitant to get a shot. In Mercer County, Ohio, they are struggling to fill appointments at one drive through vaccination location. Appointments are now down by about half what they were when the site launched back in January. Local health officials are saying they're seeing similar trends throughout the state of Ohio, particularly in rural areas. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: I'm Kylie Atwood at the State Department. The Biden administration continues to urge all Americans not to travel abroad due to the coronavirus pandemic. And the State Department issued a statement on Monday saying that they are going to be updating their travel advisories to be more in line with the travel advisories coming from the CDC. And as a result, they're going to be approximately 80 percent of countries worldwide that are now going to be at the level 4 travel advisory from the State Department. That is their highest level travel advisory, it means do not travel.",0.999626307922272,2021-04-20

858554,1135742,CNN,CNN: Special Investigations Unit,"BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: Hi there. I'm Brooke Baldwin at the CNN World Headquarters here in Atlanta. Here's a look at some of the stories at this hour. First, the U.S. State Department is expected to issue a new travel advisory to Americans in Europe. An advisory we're hearing could come as early as tomorrow morning and U.S. officials say it will urge Americans to be vigilante, be alert in public spaces, tourist spots, transportation hubs. One senior U.S. official is calling this, quote, ""a serious situation."" The official also says U.S. Military Bases are also taking precautions. The advisory, by the way, is based on an increase in terror threat information, not on any one specific threat. Earlier, I spoke with CNN's Phil Black about how the British are now reacting to this new terror information. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We learned of a plot that was described as a possible Mumbai style attack like the one that took place in the City of Mumbai two years ago, with a team of people attacking multiple sites using small arms - guns and grenades, that sort of thing. So we're told that it's no new intelligence pointing to that but we're told that officials in Europe and the United States are taking that potential threat so seriously that America would consider issuing a warning just like the one that we're hearing about. This British Intelligence sources also told us there's another potential reason behind this. That is a feared backlash against France and its legislation to ban women from wearing the full face veil, the so-called burqa ban. But crucially, we're hearing in Britain that there are no plans for Britain to increase its security threat. That remains it's severe, which means a threat is considered highly likely it's the second highest level. (END VIDEO CLIP) BALDWIN: Again, to be clear, the travel advisory for Americans in Europe has not yet been issued. And those are the headlines. CNN Special Investigation we're calling ""RIGHT ON THE EDGE"" starts now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The type of business or service you provide.

In fact, I haven't seen any people at all wearing masks. Just saw one person at the airport. You don't get the sense here that there's any sort of panic at all, but you do get the strong sense that there is a lot of anger, especially directed at the World Health Organization for issuing that travel advisory. One person who was especially angry is Toronto's mayor, Mel Lastman, who spoke about the economic impact of the SARS fear on the city. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MEL LASTMAN, TORONTO, ONTARIO: We depend greatly on tourism -- we get 22 million tourists a year, and yes, our city is continuing, they're moving the way they always do, they're working, the malls are jammed, but the hotels aren't doing much business and the restaurants aren't. We need the tourists, and they're hurting us. And to wait three weeks is ridiculous when they haven't even been here in the first place.

Joining me right now, two day care workers, along with six babies to sort of give us their opinions what's been happening in the city. I'm going to start here with you. Give us a sense of what you've been thinking, especially in terms of what the WHO decided to do by issuing that travel advisory. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think they sort of blew it out of proportion. I mean, people are really nervous now about just traveling and everybody's wearing masks, and I think it's not really necessary for not everyone, you know, like I think people who are -- who have the weak immune system and the elderly might want to take extra precaution, but you know, it's a little blown out of proportion I believe. CARROLL: Bridget, I'm going to move over to your friend here, Nicole. Nicole, again, obviously, WHO has issued that travel advisory. You were pretty upset about that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah, I think you know, there is really no need for it, as you can see, really nobody's wearing masks. A lot of people aren't scared by it. People are still going out and having fun and you know, Toronto's a really great city to enjoy. So you know, they're taking the precautions that they are at the hospitals, which is great. So there's really no need to worry about it, and to say that people shouldn't come to Toronto, you know, when there are worse things going on, it just seems a little silly. CARROLL: Two folks here with six babies. You feel as though it's been blown out of proportion. Want to thank you very much for joining us. Earlier the mayor of Toronto spoke about three weeks.

We'll explain what it all means coming up just ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRUNHUBER: Well, the U.S. State Department has lifted its global do not travel advisory. It had been in places March. Now this comes as many countries around the world reduce their number of coronavirus infections but it also comes as Americans face travel restrictions from other countries as cases soar in the U.S. CNN's Kylie Atwood reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The State Department has lifted its global do not travel advisory that took place in March as the coronavirus pandemic was sweeping the globe. And so, Americans are now going to have to look country by country for these travel advisories. Because the State Department says there are certain countries where the situation is improving, there are certain countries where the situation is deteriorating. So they want to give American travelers actionable advice when they have plans to travel. Now we should note, however, that this doesn't mean that Americans are going to be able to travel anywhere they like. Of course, the EU is still keeping out Americans. The U.S. remains the worldwide epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic with 160,000 deaths in the U.S. alone. That is why other countries want to keep Americans out. And even on the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico, there is still no non-essential travel that is allowed at this time. Kylie Atwood, CNN, the State Department.

1755992,2071763,CNN,New Day Saturday,"just publicity? DENNARD: A political stunt. BROOKS: No, let's be very clear about this. This is not a publicity stunt. This is a civil rights measure based on widely known facts. The fact of the matter is, in the state of Missouri, African-American citizens are 75 percent more likely to be detained by the police than their white counterparts. Those are facts. The racial disparities with respect to policing in the state are well-known facts. The NAACP state conference and the national NAACP took this step to provide a measure of protection for citizens traveling within the state. It is not an economic boycott. Let's focus on the facts. It is a travel advisory. In other words, making people aware of the unjust and unsafe civil rights conditions within the state of Missouri. BLACKWELL: But -- DENNARD: Well, issue a travel advisory for Baltimore, issue a travel advisory for Chicago. BLACKWELL: Hold on, let me ask you this question, Cornell. It's a travel advisory -- considering your former role with the NAACP, it's a travel advisory that ends in three weeks. What is expected to happen that's going to be dramatically different once the law takes effect that the NAACP has these quarrels with, that you would end it at the end of the month? BROOKS: Well, first of all, the travel advisory was issued in response to the passage of the law. It is a first step, not necessarily the last step. That's the first point here. The second point here is, this travel advisory goes to the civil rights conditions within the state of Missouri. As a nation's oldest civil rights organization, we're concerned about the conditions on the ground in Missouri. And here's what we've not heard. We've not heard anyone contest the lack of safety for the citizens in the state of Missouri in terms of policing. We've not heard that. And so, the point being here, the NAACP took a critical first step. It's not necessarily the last step. BLACKWELL: It's important to point out that those stats that you reported, I think we have them, we can put them on the screen, actually came from the attorney general in Missouri. BROOKS: That's right. BLACKWELL: From the 2016 report. Not from the NAACP. So this is the state acknowledging their own issues as it relates to the disparities between African-Americans and their white counterparts with being stopped and searched. Paris, last word goes to you. DENNARD: Nobody denies the fact that there are obviously some serious issues going on with our brothers and sisters in the state of Missouri. Especially St. Louis. That's a fact. But for the NAACP to not also focus on other cities like Baltimore, like Chicago, or different states is just disingenuous. This looks like a political stunt.

Let's go to our Abbi Tatton -- Abbi, how is that tourism industry being affected? ABBI TATTON, CNN INTERNET REPORTER: Wolf, this is flights, vacations, cruises -- all being postponed, delayed or even canceled as people try and watch and see how this develops. Carnival Cruise Lines this week said that they're going to be stopping ports of call in Mexico until May 4th. That means if you are on a ship that was heading to Cabo San Lucas, now you might find yourself stopping in San Francisco on the other coast. Instead of Cozumel, you might now be heading to Key West. In Britain, where there's a similar travel advisory to that in the United States, essentially about non-essential travel, the three of the biggest tour operators there have said no flights -- none of their flights will be operating to Mexico until May 8th. And then two countries have gone much further than that. Cuba and Argentina have especially put in a place a travel ban to Mexico, no flights in our out of Mexico from those countries. That's not the case here in the United States. You've got about 4,000 flights a week to and from Mexico to the United States. Those are not being canceled. But the U.S. carriers are making sure that passengers can change and alter their trip easily with no fee. American Airlines said today that they have seen some increase of people doing that. They say it is less than a severe weather event, like a hurricane. But if you look at some of the pictures -- this one a flight to Mexico City -- you'll see that some are all but deserted -- Wolf.

In going to -- you're allowed -- there's no travel restrictions in the United States. The CDC and the State Department and the task force have worked hard to recognize those areas where there's significant community transmission, where we give advice that we would recommend you not travel there. And you know that China is that. We now have South Korea as a level three. We have Italy, Japan, and Iran as level three travel advisories, which we would ask you to reconsider those travel plans. But in the United States, there's no travel restrictions. I want to echo again what everyone said. The risk to the American public at this point is low. We are going to increase substantially surveillance, similar to what we do for flu. We have multiple different surveillance systems. With Dr. Hahn and FDA getting more and more tests out, those surveillance systems are going to be activated in the near future.

We're watching all of this very, very closely. The stakes clearly are enormous right now. Quickly want to get some reaction from our experts who are here. Dr. Zeke Emanuel, the risks, they repeatedly said, not just the vice president, but all the experts, including Dr. Fauci and others, the risks remain low. DR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPECIAL ADVISER: Well, I think you have to separate two risks, the risk of getting the virus and the risk of dying. Clearly, the risk of dying is low, but it's not nonexistent, and it's higher if you're old, have comorbidities even if you're not old. The risk of getting it, we simply don't know. At the moment, we have 100 cases, but we haven't tested widely. It's worth noting that you get about one in 10 people in the country get the flu even with a pretty effective vaccine. So I don't know how we're so sure it's",0.999626307922272,2020-03-02
2151033,2469098,CNN,CNN Newsroom,"(MUSIC PLAYING) ANNA COREN, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): President Trump threatens and then backs away from quarantining citizens as the U.S. death toll doubles in just the last couple of days. New York remains the epicenter but new hot spots are emerging in America. Cases surging in these three cities as hospitals are overrun with patients. Plus the, the U.K. scrambling for hospital beds and Spanish authorities issuing new lockdown measures. We're live in Madrid and London. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Anna Coren, live in Hong Kong. CNN NEWSROOM starts right now. (MUSIC PLAYING) COREN: It's 5:00 am on the U.S. East Coast and the hours ahead will see residents of three states, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, waking up to a two-week travel advisory. The region has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. So the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is telling people living there not to travel anywhere unless absolutely necessary. It's a big step back from the quarantine that U.S. president Donald Trump had suggested on Saturday, an idea rejected by one state governor. It's not clear the travel advisory actually changes anything. Stay-at- home orders are already in place in those states and many others. Other people with critical jobs, such as health care providers and delivery drivers, are exempt. Still, the CDC's latest advisory shows the Trump administration is grasping for ways to slow the pandemic in the U.S. The number of reported infections has spiraled upward to more than 121,000, far more than any other place in the world.

The pastor, her husband, is not by her side, but in Iraq, ministering to 4,000 soldiers at Camp Caldwell, near the Iranian border. Last summer, before Chaplain Berry was called up, he worried about violence, terrorism. BASH: Are you scared? REV. KENT BERRY, CRAWFORD, TEXAS: Well, you know, it's scary, yes. BASH: Now in e-mails back home, he tries to be upbeat. VICKI BERRY, REV.

BASH: Sending pictures with Iraqis he calls grateful, a ballot from an election he calls a turning point, stories of kind gestures, like an offer to hold an Iraqi baby.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Vice President -- PENCE: Steve, it's something I learned along the way, is that when we have cases that emerge, state and local health officials are in the lead, but CDC is on the ground immediately helping to identify how that might have originated with that individual to find out any other people that they've been exposed to. But we know there will be more cases. The President initially took unprecedented action to do all that we could to prevent the coronavirus coming into the country. And now we're focused on mitigation of the spread as well as treatment of the people that are effective. Kristin Fisher, Kristen Fisher here? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just walked out. PENCE: She walked out. Let me go with Hallie Jackson. HALLIE JACKSON, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, NBC NEWS: Thank you. Two questions for you, sir. And if anybody else wants to jump in. Number one, President Trump hinted today at the potential for new travel restrictions on top of what we're already seeing, related to Italy, South Korea, China, Iran. Can you elaborate on specifically what countries you're looking at? Is Germany, for example, which has seen some cases of community spread, is that on the table? And then I have a follow-up, as well. PENCE: The President is very clear. We're going to follow the facts and listen to the experts every step of the way. The action the President authorized this weekend, raising the travel advisory. The American people should know that we are saying that you should not travel to certain sections of Italy or South Korea. Those advisories may expand, but we'll allow the caseload in those countries to define that. In addition to that, by establishing the screening protocol, which will be in full force and effect within the next 12 hours, in both countries, will ensure that anyone traveling on a direct flight to the United States of America receives multiple screenings at all airports in Italy and South Korea. But to your point, the nature of the European Union is one doesn't require a passport to move around, so our task force spoke today about new cases and there were some in several European countries. Were following that very closely, and again, we'll listen to the experts. We'll watch the cases, and I know the President will make the decisions with regard to both travel advisories or restrictions on the basis of those facts. JACKSON: And my second question, sir, is just on the word pandemic. Do you, do your experts behind you here, do you consider this now a pandemic in all but designation only? PENCE: I would just refer to the experts that -- our view is that would be for the World Health Organization to define, and our team, our task force team, was in touch with the World Health Organization today.

858967,1136171,CNN,The Situation Room,"of Pakistan. Our senior international correspondent, Nic Robertson, is following what's going on. He's joining us from Hamburg, Germany, to help us connect the dots. Nic, you're just down the street from the source of one of the intelligence reports behind this threat at a mosque we have reported on before. What are you learning? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is the mosque that Mohamed Atta, one of the 9/11 hijackers, and a group around him attended back in late '90s, 2000. It's also the same place that the group that went to Pakistan to terror training camps and the individual Ahmed Sidiqi, who is in U.S. custody, who has been providing this information about the possibility of these Mumbai-style attacks across Europe, this is where they came from. Sidiqi himself was a friend of Mohamed Atta's, has been an extremist since back then. Sources here tell us that the government was aware that this mosque was a hotbed of extremism, that they had been monitoring the extremists there. Even their sources allege that the imam there was allowing radicalization, even inspired this group to go to Pakistan. Despite all of that, despite the close attention, this group still managed to put together a plan and take off for those terror training camps, Wolf. BLITZER: Nic, if the intelligence is coming from Germany where you are, why is the that neither Germany nor any of the other countries really in Western Europe, whether France or Britain, are raising their threat level or issuing similar alerts to folks there right now? ROBERTSON: You know, the interior minister here said people shouldn't get alarmist about the travel advisory. They shouldn't be alarmist about the situation in Germany. The sources we talk to here are very sensitive about Hamburg and Germany being sort of seen as a new al Qaeda spot. They are not raising their threat level. They see no imminent threat. But the reality is that when there have been plots in Germany in the past, U.S. service personnel and American citizens have been the target of those planned attacks. They were thwarted before back in 2007, a huge amount of explosives discovered with that group. They have been sent to jail. But that's the reality, that al Qaeda here has tried to target American citizens before, Wolf. And that may be why the U.S. has given this travel advisory. BLITZER: All right, we will stay in close touch with you, Nic. Thank you. Nic is in Hamburg, Germany. Here in the United States, 15 million Verizon customers could be getting some money back.

Coming up, ""The Ridiculist."" We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Time now for ""The Ridiculist."" And tonight, we have a high- tech solution to a very basic problem. You're out in public and you have to use the restroom. Now, once upon a time, when you simply might try to find the public bathroom in any number of bars or restaurants or stores, museums, movie theaters, malls, coffee shops and the like. You know what I'm talking about, but I guess the problem with that, was that in no way involved your phone. Problem solved. There's an app called Air P&P. Crew, folks liked it. Laughed. Anyway, much like the invention of the light lightbulb, or the steam engine, it will change the very nature of the world, in which we live, I think, namely by helping you find people nearby who will let you pay to use their bathrooms. You know, sometimes I really wonder is the reason we as a society haven't cured the common cold is because the most creative minds of our time are working on apps to let you do number 2s in the homes of complete strangers. Just a thought. Air P&P's founder and PEO, yes, that's what he calls himself, the PEO, got this idea in New Orleans during Mardi Gras seeing a golden opportunity, on which to capitalize. So far, not many people signed up in New York, but, you know, there are a few. Someone on the Lower East Side will let you use their bathroom for nine bucks and promises the best hand soap and lotion ever. There are some in the West Village who's only charging $3. The listing for this one notes it's near the corner of bistro, which, by the way, is a bar and by the way, has a bathroom. If you are in midtown, you can pay $10 to use the bathroom in this guy's third floor walk-up, but you also get to pet his kitten, which I truly hope is not a euphemism. (LAUGHTER) COOPER: Think about it. In general, New Yorkers do not seem to be too thrilled about this idea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",0.999626307922272,2015-02-17

PSAKI: I'm just not going to assess or give you an update on specifics from here. QUESTION: Just quickly on COVID, ahead of tomorrow's speech, should Americans expect any new restrictions? PSAKI: This is not a speech about locking the country down. This is a speech outlining and being direct and clear with the American people about the benefits of being vaccinated, the steps we're going to take to increase access and to increase testing, and the risks posed to unvaccinated individuals. Go ahead. QUESTION: Does the president still trust Senator Manchin? PSAKI: Again, I understand the questions here. But our focus is on moving forward. I think our statement yesterday made clear what the course of events were over the last couple of weeks. It was important for the American people to know and see that. But he considers Senator Manchin a longtime friend, and our focus is on moving forward and getting this done. QUESTION: Are you confident that all 49 other members of the Democratic Caucus are still on board with Build Back Better, since we're looking ahead? PSAKI: I think -- sure, I understand that. I can't obviously speak for all of them. But I think you saw quite a bit of unanimity yesterday in the response of people and their desire from across the Democratic Party and the desire to get this legislation done. QUESTION: What would be his message to progressives who he asked to hang with him as things moved over to the Senate, now that what many of them warned has happened? PSAKI: Well, I would say, one, his message would be, we need to work together to get this done. And he's going to work like hell to get it done. And that would be his message. And January is an opportunity to do exactly that. QUESTION: Quickly on Ukraine. PSAKI: Yes. QUESTION: The State Department issued a level four travel warning today, saying U.S. citizens should be aware of reports that Russia is planning for significant military action against Ukraine. Jake Sullivan spoke with his Russian counterpart again today. Apparently, over at the Pentagon, they have just said that they have conducted an assessment of air defense needs in Ukraine. Obviously, you have said you're monitoring this. Is U.S. intelligence picking up something new? PSAKI: Well, let me first say that the travel advisory for Ukraine remains a level four, do not travel, due to COVID-19. The State Department updated it to include information on Russia's military buildup on Ukraine's border, just to provide additional information, but it has been at a level four. QUESTION: So, nothing new otherwise?

ANDREA KOPPEL, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: There have been lots of travel advisories put out for Americans both before September 11 and since.

And there you'll find everything from public announcements to travel warnings to consular information sheet. And so because these are updated on a -- practically a daily basis, you would do well before you're planning to book your flight or your train -- or however you're planning on traveling -- to log on to the site and see if the country or countries that you're planning on traveling to are listed. But keep in mind that ever since the attacks, there has been a worldwide caution in effect, which just offers common advice to Americans to be alert and just exercise common sense.
