694193,954138,CNN,The Situation Room,"city about $57 million a day. Travel advisories around the world are furthering the impact on tourism to Mexico. Let's go to our Abbi Tatton -- Abbi, how is that tourism industry being affected? ABBI TATTON, CNN INTERNET REPORTER: Wolf, this is flights, vacations, cruises -- all being postponed, delayed or even canceled as people try and watch and see how this develops. Carnival Cruise Lines this week said that they're going to be stopping ports of call in Mexico until May 4th. That means if you are on a ship that was heading to Cabo San Lucas, now you might find yourself stopping in San Francisco on the other coast. Instead of Cozumel, you might now be heading to Key West. In Britain, where there's a similar travel advisory to that in the United States, essentially about non-essential travel, the three of the biggest tour operators there have said no flights -- none of their flights will be operating to Mexico until May 8th. And then two countries have gone much further than that. Cuba and Argentina have especially put in a place a travel ban to Mexico, no flights in our out of Mexico from those countries. That's not the case here in the United States. You've got about 4,000 flights a week to and from Mexico to the United States. Those are not being canceled. But the U.S. carriers are making sure that passengers can change and alter their trip easily with no fee. American Airlines said today that they have seen some increase of people doing that. They say it is less than a severe weather event, like a hurricane. But if you look at some of the pictures -- this one a flight to Mexico City -- you'll see that some are all but deserted -- Wolf. BLITZER: Yes. Tourism is such a critical, critical lifeline for everyone in Mexico. And look at that -- one person, it looks like, sitting in that seat on that flight to Mexico City. All right, Abbi, stand by. These swine flu fears -- they have people flooding urgent care centers in California. We're going there live for you. Also, Cuban leader Raul Castro says the ball is now in Washington's court -- details of his new criticism of the U.S. Stick around. Lots of news happening today, right here in THE SITUATION ROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: We've got much more coming up on this swine flu that's getting very close to -- to some sort of global pandemic that the World Health Organization is warning about. They've gone from a Level 4 to a Level 5. Level 6 is the worst. Much more on this story coming up. But let's check in with Fredrick Whitfield right now. She's monitoring some other important stories incoming into THE SITUATION ROOM right now -- Fred, what's going on? WHITFIELD: Hello to you, Wolf. Well, April is proving to be a deadly month in Iraq. Six car bombings in a four hour",0.999626307922272,2009-04-29
401495,623748,CNN,American Morning,"an awful lot of criticism in Washington and elsewhere over the plan to charge people to leave Beirut and make their way to Cyprus. New Hampshire Senator John Sununu, who happens to be of Lebanese descent, was right at the center of the criticism in this case, calling for the government to waive that payback fee, and waive the payback rules, joins us from Capitol Hill. Senator Sununu, good to have you with us. SEN. JOHN SUNUNU (R), NEW HAMPSHIRE: Good to be here. M. O'BRIEN: Well, first of all, you've got to be pleased that they reversed course. SUNUNU: I am. M. O'BRIEN: It kind of -- well, it says a little something about, I don't know, some might suggest it's a bit callous, or at the very least a bit of a tin ear to charge people who are under such duress to get home safely. SUNUNU: Well, in fairness to the administration, so many times we have here in Washington, part of the problem was the way Congress wrote the law. In 2003, we passed a law that did call for reimbursement. I think that was intended to address cases where Americans were going places where they knew they absolutely shouldn't be, putting themselves in harm's way. M. O'BRIEN: Well, to be fair here, Lebanon is on the State Department list of places that Americans are advised not to travel to. SUNUNU: Well, there is a travel advisory, that is true, but there are travel advisories for a lot countries around the world. And in the case of Lebanon, we have a relatively stable, strong and strengthening democracy. It's a place where there are tens of thousands of Americans that have family members there, that have traveled back and forth over the last several years to visit family for business. So I think it was known to be a place where Americans were visiting and there on a regular basis. I think it's also fair to say that our own State Department, our own intelligence services, didn't have any real indication that there would be attacks on public buildings, on public infrastructure in Beirut. That does makes this a little bit different and a little bit more unusual. M. O'BRIEN: You know, what we're hearing from everybody, just about everybody, that comes off that ship, is not a very pretty picture. And one of the people we talked to earlier today equated it to a Katrina-type scenario. Is there some endemic problem in the U.S. government that it can't handle a decent, a large-scale evacuation? SUNUNU: Well, this is an extraordinary evacuation. This is a case where every route out of the country has been destroyed, routes into Syria. Certainly the routes south into Israel aren't usable. The airport has been rendered completely inoperable, and even the port has been attacked. The blockade has been set around the country by the Israelis. That makes this evacuation extraordinarily difficult. The safety of these individuals comes first. Jeff Feltman,",0.999626307922272,2006-07-19

You\'ve got Cruise, ""Mission Impossible III."" Spell it out for me.\n \n\n NADINE MENDOZA, ""TV GUIDE"": Well, basically, none of this has been official. Cruise\'s rep has said that he did not say\nwhat was attributed to him.\n \n\n What happened is there was all this speculation around the blogs that Tom Cruise had put pressure on Viacom, which owns\nParamount, as well as Comedy Central. And allegedly, Tom Cruise had said he was going to stop doing promotions for ""Mission\nImpossible III"" if they didn\'t pull the repeat of the ""South Park"" episode that aired back in November, that was called ""In\nthe Closet.""\n \n\n SMERCONISH: That\'s the Isaac Hayes episode, right, ""Shaft""?\n \n\n MENDOZA: Well, the Isaac Hayes episode -- Isaac Hayes is a character that -- his character, Chef, has been on for the\nlast nine seasons. And as you know, in the opening of the 10th season, his character was killed.\n \n\n But the episode that we\'re talking about specifically was called ""In the Closet,"" and it aired back in November. And\nas a lead-in to the new season, which is the 10th season -- the show\'s been on for a decade -- they were going to re-air the\n""In the Closet"" episode, which was one of the most popular ones, which is where Tom Cruise believes that one of the boys in\nSouth Park is the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, and he goes in the closet, and 36 times the joke is, ""Tom Cruise won\'t\ncome out of the closet.""\n \n\n SMERCONISH: I want to interrupt you, because I happen to have a clip from the ""South Park"" episode that ignited the\nfeud, the one to which I think you\'re making reference. This was ""South Park\'s"" sly way of questioning, among other things,\nTom Cruise\'s sexuality.\n \n\n (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n \n\n UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dad, Tom Cruise won\'t come out of the closet.\n \n\n UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Cruise, Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet.\n \n\n UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n \n\n UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come on, Mr. Cruise.

In other words, are people saying, ""Yes, we love it when\nyou take on Scientology, so we\'re going to hang with you and watch the show""?\n \n\n MENDOZA: It\'s probably a combination of both.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is CNN breaking news. BLITZER: All right. The breaking news we're following, President Trump now backing off his earlier suggestion that he might order a temporary quarantine of parts of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Just a few moments ago, he tweeted -- he tweeted this, and let me read it in full, quote ""On the recommendation of the White House coronavirus Task Force and upon consultations with the governors of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, I have asked the CDC to issue a strong travel advisory to be administered by the governors in consultation with the federal government or quarantine will not be necessary. Full details will be released by CDC tonight. Thank you."" End quote, that from the President of the United States. That comes after the New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, tells CNN's Ana Cabrera earlier tonight that a federally mandated quarantine would basically be a federal declaration of war. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): This is a civil war kind of -- this is civil war kind of discussion. ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST: So you don't believe he really is serious about it? CUOMO: I don't believe that he could be serious that any federal administration could be serious about physical lockdowns of States or parts of states across this country. I don't believe it's legal. I think it would be economic chaos. I don't think the American people would stand for it. It's just a question of time before you see the numbers growing and hotspots all across this nation. So I think it makes absolutely no sense, and I don't believe any serious governmental personality or professional would support it. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: All right. Let's go to Jeremy Diamond. He's joining us right now from Washington, our White House correspondent. Jeremy, it sounds like the president blinked in the face of those very strong warnings from the governor of New York and simply saying there's going to be a travel advisory that sounds like something that's already in place. JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It certainly does, Wolf. Look, the timeline of how the president consider this and the fact that he is now backing down from the proposal that he issued this morning, which was he was talking about something that would be federally enforced. He was talking about preventing New Yorkers, people in Connecticut, people in New Jersey from being able to travel elsewhere in the country. What the President is now talking about is a travel advisory that would be done in coordination with the governors of those three states. And so you have to look at what changed between when the President proposed this and when the President is now backing down. And all that changed",0.999626307922272,2020-03-28
693197,953011,CNN,State Of The Union With John King,"is taking to try to prevent further spread of a swine flu virus here in the United States. More than 80 dead in Mexico. No fatalities reported as yet in the United States, but 20 cases the administration now confirms in five states. We have Fran Townsend, our homeland security adviser with us, Elizabeth Cohen, our medical correspondent. A quick programming footnote at the top. ""FAREED ZAKARIA: GPS"" will be seen in its entirety. If you tuned in expecting to see Fareed, we will play that program for you in its entirety. First, though, we want to take a few minutes to discuss these important developments. Fran Townsend, let me start with you, a few months ago, that would have been your job to step into the briefing. You were the homeland security adviser to President Bush. In terms of the plan they laid out, about how they're monitoring this and what they plan to do, how are they doing? TOWNSEND: Not bad. I mean, this is a good start. A little interesting that John Brennan, who occupies my former position, led off the brief. We need to know who's in charge. More importantly, the president needs to know who is in charge. That is Janet Napolitano. They talked about her being the lead member of the cabinet, but there is not -- it was a little inconsistent, but it will be important as she asserts herself. One thing they mentioned was that there has been this announcement of a public health emergency. Well, the companion piece to that on the security side is the declaration of an incident of national significance. They've now confirmed 28 confirmed swine flu cases in five states. They're taking actions with state and local officials, regardless of even if this doesn't get any bigger, this is an incident of national significance. She needs to assert her role so she can coordinate across the federal government that not only includes the Department of Homeland Security, but as she mentioned, the military, DOD, Health and Human Services, who doesn't have a cabinet secretary. And so she has got a larger role. The other thing I would note, John, is the State Department, we haven't heard much about the travel advisories. Most Americans, when they go to travel overseas, look to the State Department travel advisories, those haven't been posted yet with over -- you know, many deaths. KING: And let's show our viewers, as you make that, what could be an important point. The CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, does have an advisory on its Web site, but if you're leaving the country, as you know, if you look do online, you would probably look at the State Department. This is the State Department Web site there. You see Secretary Clinton, a message about her efforts to bring stability to Iraq, but as yet nothing on the home page of the State Department site, which is, again, where many Americans might go if they were",0.999626307922272,2009-04-26

NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Poppy, a couple of regional airlines have already said they will cease to operate by early April. Compass Air, which runs some regional flights for Delta and American as well as Trans States. And we're seeing major airlines cancel a lot of flights as well due to low demand. Just looking at the boards, you know, less than half of the flights we're seeing have red cancel letters next to them. We've hardly seen anyone check in their bags behind us, and airport staff are telling us it feels eerie. They've never seen this place so quiet. And if you go over to out other camera, next to the security lines right now, we see ebbs and flows. Earlier, a little bit more traffic. But now, not so many people. And those who are there, by the way, are not exactly keeping that six-foot distance apart from each other. We also spoke to a couple who just got back from London in the nick of time, as the State Department was announcing that travel advisory. And they say they feel lucky that if their flight home had been booked a couple of days later, they may have been stuck in England. And now their problem is getting from Atlanta to Little Rock because a lot of domestic flights have been cancelled. They've been rebooked a few times, just trying to get home. As far as the domestic travel ban possibility goes, here is Dr. Anthony Fauci discussing how they consider that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We discuss everything in the task force. I have not heard a serious discussion about shutting down domestic travel. Might that come up the next time we start looking at this -- and we look at it constantly? Certainly. There's no plan tomorrow or the next day to seriously think about shutting down domestic air travel. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHEN: And with so few people coming through the airports, Poppy, if there is a domestic travel ban announced at some point, it may be moot with a lot of operations, with airlines and airports just grinding to a halt. HARLOW: And the question is for how long -- no one has any idea. Natasha, thanks for being there. CHEN: Exactly. HARLOW: Right now in Florida, mobile hospitals and drive-through testing sites are opening up and Floridians are lining up. Let's go back to our Leyla Santiago who joins us in Pembroke Pines, Florida. What is the situation there in terms of the readiness of these facilities? LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, even the governor has acknowledged that there are a lot of variables here with these mobile sites.

This attack today? Could it inspire others to go after U.S. targets? The concern I've heard is if these people are willing to kill fellow Muslims, fellow Pakistanis, young kids, you can imagine what they would do to Americans or Europeans if given the chance. PSAKI: Well, we take -- every time an event like this happens, you take a look at what this means, what it could mean. That's not an assessment we're making at this time. But again, any of our American citizens who are living in Pakistan, who are serving bravely in Pakistan, are in a high threat post. We provide information publicly to people living there and we certainly take necessary precautions on the ground. BLITZER: So in terms of travel advisories, the State Department doesn't think this is necessarily a good time for Americans to visit Pakistan? PSAKI: Well, we've had a travel advisory in place for some time. That hasn't changed. We haven't put out new information. But certainly there have long been threats and ones American citizens would face there. BLITZER: All right. We're going to continue our conversation, Jen. There's a lot more I want to talk about, including this threat. Is it coming from North Korea, a threat about this new film? The interview -- stand by. Lots more to discuss with the State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, right after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER: We're following the breaking terror news, at least 145 people killed in a Taliban attack at a school in Pakistan. Most of the victims, once again: school kids. Also, the chilling terror threat against audiences for the new comedy film, ""The Interview,"" and its controversial plot centering around the assassination of North Korea's Kim Jong-un. A group that claims it hacked Sony Pictures, the studio behind the film, says moviegoers will suffer, in their words, ""a bitter fate,"" and they are warning, and I'm quoting now, very ominously, ""Remember the 11th of September"" -- their words. We're back with the State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki. Jen, is North Korea behind this threat and this computer hacking of Sony Pictures? PSAKI: Well, the appropriate government officials are looking into that now. It takes a long time to assess where these cyber attacks come from. It is something we've unfortunately had to do more frequently lately. So there's not a final assessment of that. That is something that's in process. BLITZER: So -- but they are suspected of doing it. Can we say they are under suspicion? PSAKI: Well, there are -- I'm not going to get into more details, obviously, given the subject of the movie; that's not far to guess. BLITZER: Do they have that kind of capability, the North?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Vice President -- PENCE: Steve, it's something I learned along the way, is that when we have cases that emerge, state and local health officials are in the lead, but CDC is on the ground immediately helping to identify how that might have originated with that individual to find out any other people that they've been exposed to. But we know there will be more cases. The President initially took unprecedented action to do all that we could to prevent the coronavirus coming into the country. And now we're focused on mitigation of the spread as well as treatment of the people that are effective. Kristin Fisher, Kristen Fisher here? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just walked out. PENCE: She walked out. Let me go with Hallie Jackson. HALLIE JACKSON, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, NBC NEWS: Thank you. Two questions for you, sir. And if anybody else wants to jump in. Number one, President Trump hinted today at the potential for new travel restrictions on top of what we're already seeing, related to Italy, South Korea, China, Iran. Can you elaborate on specifically what countries you're looking at? Is Germany, for example, which has seen some cases of community spread, is that on the table? And then I have a follow-up, as well. PENCE: The President is very clear. We're going to follow the facts and listen to the experts every step of the way. The action the President authorized this weekend, raising the travel advisory. The American people should know that we are saying that you should not travel to certain sections of Italy or South Korea. Those advisories may expand, but we'll allow the caseload in those countries to define that. In addition to that, by establishing the screening protocol, which will be in full force and effect within the next 12 hours, in both countries, will ensure that anyone traveling on a direct flight to the United States of America receives multiple screenings at all airports in Italy and South Korea. But to your point, the nature of the European Union is one doesn't require a passport to move around, so our task force spoke today about new cases and there were some in several European countries. Were following that very closely, and again, we'll listen to the experts. We'll watch the cases, and I know the President will make the decisions with regard to both travel advisories or restrictions on the basis of those facts. JACKSON: And my second question, sir, is just on the word pandemic. Do you, do your experts behind you here, do you consider this now a pandemic in all but designation only? PENCE: I would just refer to the experts that -- our view is that would be for the World Health Organization to define, and our team, our task force team, was in touch with the World Health Organization today.

Well, I think it's probably not a bad idea to ask someone for a direction or something, but I wouldn't reveal any more than I had to. (END VIDEOTAPE) WHITFIELD: All right. One more thing to think about. Don Hamilton says don't wear sneakers in Europe unless you're going for a run. Unlike Americans, most Europeans don't wear them unless they're involved in some kind of sporting activity. So in other words, he says you need to try to blend in whenever you do go abroad. All right. Americans aren't the only ones on alert. Britain is changing its travel advisory for its citizens in France and Germany from a substantial threat of terrorism to a high threat. CNN's International Correspondent Nic Robertson is in Hamburg, Germany. He joins us live from now. So, why is this happening right now on such grand scale? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Fredricka, it appears to be because of a threat that's really emanated from this mosque behind me that's closed down the mosque here is the very same mosque that Mohammed (ph) after the 9/11 hijacker got together with a small group - a small cell back in the late 1990s and again has been the place where a group of young radicals have got together and gone off to training camps in Pakistan about a year and a half ago. One of them now in U.S. custody, Ahmed Siddiqui (ph), talking about this Mumbai style attacks across different cities in Europe. But although that's not what is explicit - that's not explicit in this travel advisory, it does seem to correlate because it's talking about the same countries -- Britain, Germany and France. What's interesting here, while Britain also has raised its warning for British people traveling overseas, Germans here are saying that they are not seeing an increase threat and they're not raising their threat level in Germany. The Spanish too is saying their threat level is at two on a scale of one to four. They'll leave it right there. The French too, their threat level is on a red level. They say it's been that way since 2005 and they see no imminent threat and no reason to change it. And in Britain the threat level there on the British Isles remains severe which means a terrorist attack is highly likely, but, again, the British authorities are saying that they're not going to raise that level. So I think the European perspective is that - that it's not necessary to change - to change the way they read the terror situation. Having said that, they're all very vigilant, very aware and certainly the officials in this city are very aware that some of the people that left this mosque part of their original group are still out there, Fredricka.

(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) ZAIN VERJEE, CO-ANCHOR OF CNN INTERNATIONAL'S EUROPEAN ""WORLD ONE"" SHOW: How do you think the tourism industry is going to be impacted because of this attack? ADIL POPAT, CEO, SIMBA CORPORATION: I think tourism is going to hurt for sure. It's a pity that the United States has now given a travel advisory, and I think one of the things that we as Kenyans feel is that it's very easy to get a message of condolence and support from the West, but with the same hand, you know, you put a travel advisory out there. And these kind of things have happened in the United States many times. You've had people being killed in schools and offices, and I believe this is a random event. And having a travel advisory really doesn't help us. We need a time for solidarity many people to say, look, we're really going to support you and that kind of travel advisory does nobody any good. So, it's going to hurt us. VERJEE: What do businessmen like yourselves, other people in the hotel industry and others in the tourism industry in general, what can they do to kind of offset the negative images, the travel advisory - what kind of actions do you take? Lower prices? POPAT: Well, lowering prices I don't think will help in any respect. I think what we need to do is work with the government, learn from lessons in other countries. VERJEE: How much does the Kenyan economy rely on the tourism industry? POPAT: Oh, I think it's a kingpin of our economy. If tourism is doing well, then people come in and invest in this country. You know, it all connects. And I think tourism is really a crux that we need to look after. There are so many people that come to this country as tourists and come back as investors. VERJEE: Do you think that the way that Kenya has been an attractive country, all of Eastern Africa, for investment, is going to be hit in the long-term? Or will investors see this as a kind of a blip in the - you know - the blip on the map because there's infrastructure here, energy exploration, housing, like all these macro industries that are becoming very attractive to investors? POPAT: I think Kenya's attraction to the West - to the Chinese to the East - is always going to continue. Because this is a great environment in which to invest. Our people are our biggest asset.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALKER: All right, so with all the uncertainty about the coronavirus outbreak, many people have questions about whether they should travel and how they can keep themselves healthy if they do travel. PAUL: Yes, so let's talk to Dr. Nadeen White. She's also a travel blogger, as well as a practicing medical doctor. Thank you so much for being here. We appreciate it. I know there are a lot of people struggling with, do I take my family on this trip? Do I not? What -- how do you make that determination that it's right or wrong for you? DR. NADEEN WHITE, PEDIATRICIAN IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA: Sure. Well, thanks for having me, first of all. PAUL: Of course. WHITE: I think it's important to get the facts out there. PAUL: OK. WHITE: And for people to make decisions based on themselves, their own family, every situation is going to be different. But the thing that they first need to look at is the travel advisories. So, on the CDC and State Department web sites, they have travel advisories from level one to four. Three and four are the most serious advisories. So, for instance, on the CDC web site, level three is to avoid non-essential travel. On the State Department, that's similar for level three and level four is do not travel. So, the first thing you have to look at is what's your destination, where are you going to? So, right now, there's limitations on travel to China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. So I would say if you had plans to go to any of those countries, in the next few weeks, then you should not go. WALKER: There is this kind of grey area, though, especially when it comes to domestic travel, right? WHITE: Right. WALKER: And for me, especially, I mean, not especially, but me, included. WHITE: Yes. WALKER: You know parents are -- we're scheduled to fly to Atlanta from California on -- in a couple of days from now, and we're really reconsidering. But let's say you do fly. WHITE: Right? WALKER: What precautions do you need to take? WHITE: Right. WALKER: I mean should you take your wipes and wipe everything down? WHITE: Absolutely. Absolutely. So, the main way that they feel that spread is by respiratory molecules. So, basically, somebody coughs or sneezes near you, usually within six feet, that's the most likely way that you're going to get it, is being in contact with somebody who has a virus. But the virus does live on inanimate object, so, it can live on the tray tables, armrest, the airlines are doing a good job of beefing up, cleaning the planes in between flights.

You guys know Paulina Porizkova as a supermodel and rock star`s wife, which you might not know is that behind her face beautiful face was another woman entirely. One who hid a secret that she candidly discussed with me recently. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PINSKY: Paulina Porizkova was a supermodel in the 1980s and graced the covers of ""Sports Illustrated"" famed swimsuit edition not once but twice. And she`s now a talented writer and currently blogs for the ""Huffington Post."" She caught our attention when she recently wrote an article titled, ""Ending a mid-life affair with meds,"" in which she talks about her severe anxiety attacks and some depressive symptoms, and how she turned to the antidepressant Lexapro for help. So welcome, Paulina. Now, why - PAULINA PORIZKOVA, HAD ""AFFAIR"" WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS: Thank you. PINSKY: Before I ask you questions about why publicize this, now, let me give my personal reveals (ph) out of the way - PORIZKOVA: Please. I`ve been waiting for this (ph). PINSKY: Well, I know I just told you (INAUDIBLE), but my daughter is named Paulina and it was actually a friend of ours that said, ""You know, Paulina Porizkova is Czech, which my wife is Czech (ph) and that name is so pretty, and Paulina Pinsky and Paulina Porizkova and that`s just - PORIZKOVA: P.P. PINSKY: -- P.P. as we call her. PORIZKOVA: You know, that would be a little scary if you didn`t clarify. PINSKY: I know. It sounds like I`m just kind of a weird stalker. But it is in fact the case that we named her after you, so thank you for that. And that she`s heading up to New York for college. PORIZKOVA: Oh, my God, I`m so proud. Thank you. Is she just beautiful and intelligent - PINSKY: Yes. Just the same as you, exactly. Exactly. PORIZKOVA: Yes, exactly. PINSKY: So let`s go on with Lexapro - as I blush here. Let us - let us talk about Lexapro. Why publicize this issue now? PORIZKOVA: Well, you know what, I never thought of it as publicizing initially to tell you the truth, because I write, you know I`m a writer, and I write a blog for HuffPo, and I sort of write things that come to my mind. You know, I just - things I notice, things that I think about. And it seems that women my age sort of tend to, you know, we tend to think very much alike about aging and beauty and fame. And so I just thought, you know, this is something that I was dealing with and there was one point in my life when I was on Lexapro where I was - I",0.9998187083615973,2011-12-23

At a certain point, they have to take some action. The Democrats can do it. The Democrats can call for censure. But it's very different if Republicans say, we need to censure her. Took them five days to get this far, as you point out. As you point out, Steve Scalise wouldn't even, couldn't even get there all the way. But when are they going to say, she has no place in the Republican Party? HILL: It's a great question. I got to tell you, after waiting five days to hear that those comments were appalling -- BORGER: Yes. HILL: -- and then hearing a little bit more whataboutism, I'm not sure how much longer. It could be a long wait. BORGER: Exactly. HILL: Gloria, Manu, thank you both. BORGER: Thank you. HILL: A warning from the U.S. State Department about travel to Japan. What does that mean about America's top athletes who are now preparing to head there for the Olympic games? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAMEROTA: The Tokyo Olympics are just two months away but the U.S. State Department is telling Americans not to travel to Japan because of the coronavirus situation there. The level-four ""Do Not Travel"" advisory is the highest level in the State Department's hierarchy of warnings. HILL: There have been multiple protests in Tokyo demanding officials cancel the games. Japanese citizens have been critical of the government's response to the pandemic and don't feel the games can be held safely. Christine Brennan is a CNN sports analyst and a sports columnist for ""USA Today."" Christine, when we look at this, travel advisory, American tourists, don't go there. What does this say to American athletes who are preparing to go to the games? CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: All systems are go right now, Erica, with the U.S. athletes. The U.S. Olympic Committee is saying that and Japanese officials as well, and all athletes from the world still are planning on it. But it throws another question mark out there. This was supposed to be a joyous union, having the world gather to say we have fought coronavirus and the world has come out strongest because of it. Instead, this Olympics is sending a completely different message. Right now, that's a shame if, in fact, the games do happen, which we believe they will. CAMEROTA: Christine, I understand you will be going to these at the moment, that's your plan at least. But Japan has only vaccinated 2.3 percent of their population. That doesn't sound like a good omen for the games. BRENNAN: Not at all. In fact, that's the headline. If Japan were like the United States or other countries, I think we would be looking at a very different scenario. But whether it was overconfidence they beat the virus or concern about foreign vaccines coming into the country, whatever it was, slow",0.999626307922272,2021-05-25
858369,1135509,CNN,CNN: Special Investigations Unit,"BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: Hi there. I'm Brooke Baldwin at the CNN World Headquarters here in Atlanta. Here's a look at some of the stories at this hour. First, the U.S. State Department is expected to issue a new travel advisory to Americans in Europe. An advisory we're hearing could come as early as tomorrow morning and U.S. officials say it will urge Americans to be vigilante, be alert in public spaces, tourist spots, transportation hubs. One senior U.S. official is calling this, quote, ""a serious situation."" The official also says U.S. Military Bases are also taking precautions. The advisory, by the way, is based on an increase in terror threat information, not on any one specific threat. Earlier, I spoke with CNN's Phil Black about how the British are now reacting to this new terror information. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We learned of a plot that was described as a possible Mumbai style attack like the one that took place in the City of Mumbai two years ago, with a team of people attacking multiple sites using small arms - guns and grenades, that sort of thing. So we're told that it's no new intelligence pointing to that but we're told that officials in Europe and the United States are taking that potential threat so seriously that America would consider issuing a warning just like the one that we're hearing about. This British Intelligence sources also told us there's another potential reason behind this. That is a feared backlash against France and its legislation to ban women from wearing the full face veil, the so-called burqa ban. But crucially, we're hearing in Britain that there are no plans for Britain to increase its security threat. That remains it's severe, which means a threat is considered highly likely it's the second highest level. (END VIDEO CLIP) BALDWIN: Again, to be clear, the travel advisory for Americans in Europe has not yet been issued. And those are the headlines. CNN Special Investigation we're calling ""RIGHT ON THE EDGE"" starts now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The type of business or service you provide. Let me make sure there's a code for it, OK? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A code for prostitution. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Dancing. Dancing is considered an art. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sex is kind of like dancing, right? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. ABBIE BOUDREAU, CNN HOST (voice-over): A new generation of Conservatives. Hannah Giles and James O'Keefe. They dressed up as a prostitute and a pimp to expose ACORN. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE). BOUDREAU: Lila Rose. LILA ROSE, PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST: (INAUDIBLE). BOUDREAU: She's an anti-abortion activist who poses undercover at Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. ROSE: (INAUDIBLE) right now. They were burned at the stake. They were shot for what they believed in. What are we going to do? BOUDREAU: Christian Hartsock, works in Hollywood and directs films with a Conservative message. CHRISTIAN HARTSOCK, FILMMAKER, ACTIVIST: Freeze. BOUDREAU (on camera): How far do you think young Conservatives will go to expose",0.999626307922272,2010-10-02
2137642,2455555,CNN,At This Hour,"of the game, what people will talk about is this idea of social distancing, trying to isolate people as much as possible, as much as reasonable for a period of time. A couple of weeks perhaps. And that means kids staying home from school, people trying to work from home. But also, you know, do you have your medicines in case you can't get to the pharmacy? Do you have enough supplies? Look around your House. If you're told, hey, look, I'm not going to leave the house for up to a couple of weeks, do I have what I need here? That's the sort of preparedness planning that people often talk about in the midst of an outbreak of some sort. Hospitals will probably cancel elective operations and be focusing on surge capacity. Big gymnasiums, big public buildings will be thought of as not just public spaces but possibly isolation areas. So the whole community, from the medical side, the social side, schools, all that starts to change. But I think the biggest thing is you want to distance yourself from people for a bit because you don't want to contract this virus. Are you in a position to do that? I think that's the practicality of it. If you have young children, it does mean diapers. If you're an older person that takes meds, it does mean making sure you have enough medications to get you through that time period. Those practical sort of tips. BOLDUAN: Cautious but vigilant. GUPTA: That's right. BOLDUAN: As a mom, with a baby at home, you can never have too many diapers is kind of the way I always think of it. GUPTA: You're always prepared. BOLDUAN: What about travel? What about people with travel plans outside the United States? GUPTA: I have talked to several folks about this issue. You know, there's been a lot of back and forth regarding travel restrictions. BOLDUAN: Yes. GUPTA: I don't think this idea of people being restricted, travel into the United States from other countries, is probably going to be that meaningful once you start to see so many areas around the world where the virus is spreading because you're talking about South Korea, Italy, Iran, all these different places. But I think what you are going to hear is travel advisories for people within the United States to these other countries. So you want to check to see is there a travel advisory. The highest is saying don't travel there and then there's non-essential travel. But you can look. The State Department is continuously updating that. I wrote down Italy, for example, is a level two travel warning right now, Iran a level four. You want to check that and determine whether your travel still makes sense. BOLDUAN: Those two Web sites, like Amy Klobuchar, offered up on the Web site, CDC.gov. The CDC's Web site very important, as well as the State Department Web site as far as those travel updates.

They'll update us on the new travel advisories. So be sure to watch that. Michael and Hala. GORANI: All right, Nick Valencia, thanks very much in Dallas. Of course, if you're planning to travel on this Thanksgiving holiday, make sure you check your flights ahead of time. Some of them, a lot of them, may get canceled. HOLMES: Yes, I know Nick's ready. He's got his red CNN severe weather jacket on. Let's go to Chad Myers now. He hasn't donned the jacket yet. Where is it? What can people expect as it continues to move? CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: You know, I don't think people expected a storm to roll through Dallas in November. And that's part of the problem. Another problem is that, let's just say there are 300 flights canceled. I don't have a number because you have to add up all the airlines. One hundred and fifty people on each plane. That's 4,500 people now that have to find another plane with seats on it. These seats are jammed. I've been trying to fly around the country here just to go to different stories like Miami and to Vegas and there's one, two, seven flights -- seats open on any flight. You've got 4,000 people trying to get on seven seats and all of a sudden it's just going to be -- if it's starting already on Monday and we have Tuesday is the worst day and then Wednesday and Thursday is the big travel days, you just plan on packing your patience and maybe plan on taking the money that the airlines may give you for not sitting in that seat because there's going to be a lot of bumped people I'm afraid. Here's the deal with Tuesday. This is what I'm afraid of. The models always warm up the air and they think it's going to rain. Then it rains but it's 31. That's not good. This entire area from Philadelphia westward, I'm talking State College, Pittsburgh, right on down into Wheeling, this is the danger zone where it's going to be raining and 32 or raining and 31. You're talking major Interstate 75. You've got 81 through here. You've got 80 going across here. You've got 70. You've got Lexington right through here. And this is the area, this is the battle zone of the warm air aloft. It's 35 degrees at 3,000 feet. It's 31 degrees where you live. And that's the issue. When it rains through it, it's going to freeze on contact. All of I-95 is going to be wet. Just wet. Liquid wet. That's great, but the winds are going to be blowing at 40 miles per hour. So I suspect that a lot of the airlines are going to have to either cancel or slow down",0.999626307922272,2013-11-25

Then when I was looking out, and I saw someone look in amazement to the front. I knew they had shot my husband. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He sustained one shot in the lower right chin and the other six hit him in the chest and the body. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I looked out at him and I said, he's going to die. I kept saying to myself, he's going to die. He's going to die. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Medic immediately. Now, he wasn't dead immediately. But expired very shortly. (END VIDEOTAPE) COOPER: It's a fascinating look. The CNN special report ""Witnessed: the Assassination of Malcolm X. It's next at the top of the hour right here on CNN. I hope you watch it. Coming up, ""The Ridiculist."" We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER: Time now for ""The Ridiculist."" And tonight, we have a high- tech solution to a very basic problem. You're out in public and you have to use the restroom. Now, once upon a time, when you simply might try to find the public bathroom in any number of bars or restaurants or stores, museums, movie theaters, malls, coffee shops and the like. You know what I'm talking about, but I guess the problem with that, was that in no way involved your phone. Problem solved. There's an app called Air P&P. Crew, folks liked it. Laughed. Anyway, much like the invention of the light lightbulb, or the steam engine, it will change the very nature of the world, in which we live, I think, namely by helping you find people nearby who will let you pay to use their bathrooms. You know, sometimes I really wonder is the reason we as a society haven't cured the common cold is because the most creative minds of our time are working on apps to let you do number 2s in the homes of complete strangers. Just a thought. Air P&P's founder and PEO, yes, that's what he calls himself, the PEO, got this idea in New Orleans during Mardi Gras seeing a golden opportunity, on which to capitalize. So far, not many people signed up in New York, but, you know, there are a few. Someone on the Lower East Side will let you use their bathroom for nine bucks and promises the best hand soap and lotion ever. There are some in the West Village who's only charging $3. The listing for this one notes it's near the corner of bistro, which, by the way, is a bar and by the way, has a bathroom. If you are in midtown, you can pay $10 to use the bathroom in this guy's third floor walk-up, but you also get to pet his kitten, which I truly hope is not a euphemism. (LAUGHTER) COOPER: Think about it. In general, New Yorkers do not seem to be too thrilled about this idea. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",0.999626307922272,2015-02-17

Last summer, before Chaplain Berry was called up, he worried about violence, terrorism. BASH: Are you scared? REV. KENT BERRY, CRAWFORD, TEXAS: Well, you know, it's scary, yes. BASH: Now in e-mails back home, he tries to be upbeat. VICKI BERRY, REV. BERRY'S WIFE: A little tension happens here or there, but most of it is good, positive stuff, and what he's able to do for the soldiers. BASH: Sending pictures with Iraqis he calls grateful, a ballot from an election he calls a turning point, stories of kind gestures, like an offer to hold an Iraqi baby.

You\'ve got Cruise, ""Mission Impossible III."" Spell it out for me.\n \n\n NADINE MENDOZA, ""TV GUIDE"": Well, basically, none of this has been official. Cruise\'s rep has said that he did not say\nwhat was attributed to him.\n \n\n What happened is there was all this speculation around the blogs that Tom Cruise had put pressure on Viacom, which owns\nParamount, as well as Comedy Central. And allegedly, Tom Cruise had said he was going to stop doing promotions for ""Mission\nImpossible III"" if they didn\'t pull the repeat of the ""South Park"" episode that aired back in November, that was called ""In\nthe Closet.""\n \n\n SMERCONISH: That\'s the Isaac Hayes episode, right, ""Shaft""?\n \n\n MENDOZA: Well, the Isaac Hayes episode -- Isaac Hayes is a character that -- his character, Chef, has been on for the\nlast nine seasons. And as you know, in the opening of the 10th season, his character was killed.\n \n\n But the episode that we\'re talking about specifically was called ""In the Closet,"" and it aired back in November. And\nas a lead-in to the new season, which is the 10th season -- the show\'s been on for a decade -- they were going to re-air the\n""In the Closet"" episode, which was one of the most popular ones, which is where Tom Cruise believes that one of the boys in\nSouth Park is the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, and he goes in the closet, and 36 times the joke is, ""Tom Cruise won\'t\ncome out of the closet.""\n \n\n SMERCONISH: I want to interrupt you, because I happen to have a clip from the ""South Park"" episode that ignited the\nfeud, the one to which I think you\'re making reference.
