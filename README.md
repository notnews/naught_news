## Naught News: Proportion of 'soft news' on NBC and CNN

We use the [notnews package](https://github.com/notnews/notnews) (`pred_what_news_us`) to estimate the proportion of 'soft news' over time on [NBC](https://github.com/notnews/nbc_transcripts) and [CNN](https://github.com/notnews/cnn_transcripts). 

### Scripts and Outputs

1. Dot plot by show by channel (aggregated over time)
2. Over time trends by channel

### Future Work
We extend the data by scraping additional data to 2020.
